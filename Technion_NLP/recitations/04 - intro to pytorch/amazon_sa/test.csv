"I loved season 1 and greatly disappointed in season 2 (too much stupid middle school drama and not enough zombies), and had reservations about season 3. If the rest of the season is as good as episode 1, season 3 could be better than season 1! Lots of zombies, good sets and just the right amount of drama, realistic and approtriate without being silly or boring. I'm looking forward to a good season.",Positive
"Amazon Instant Video released this preview before it will be shown in theaters.  With the high cost of theater visits, I was able to view this new release from the comfort of own home.",Negative
"Hell on Wheels season 1 is raw and fast moving.  A diverse set of characters who show the mix of cultures, including prejudices, that inhabited the Union Pacific's construction camp.  Always absorbing.",Positive
"I recognized the title as a highly praise book, so I was determined to watch it.  The slow start was necessary to set the stage for the following episodes.  The setting was in the 18th century, but the problems woven into the story are very modern. There were so many characters that it took an entire showing for an introduction.  Actually the variety of characters required the watcher to keep up with the overall story.  Bob&#8217;s Girl",Positive
Their love for history and the stories behind the items they pick is infectious.  It makes me wish I had paid better attention to the items in my grandmother's and great aunt's homes.,Positive
"When I was a young man running my first rig in the Oil Fields in Kern county California, was having trouble with doing jobs faster than the other crews I worked with. One day the man who trained me pulled me aside and said ""You don't get it... They don't want good operators, they want good liars"".In this wonderfully written and acted series, Minnie Driver and Eddie Izzard test that theory, in the world of the upper class, by ""stealing the American dream"".  This series brings the public to a mostly unknown hidden culture in America of the Travelers (Irish Gypsies) which is something cool in a TV show, going so far out of the box of regular TV writing it's in another warehouse.If you want something very different, ""The Riches"" is a show for you.",Positive
I love this show!I am a Amazon Prime member and I am willing topay the new price.  Just wish you would put on more seasons forprime members.,Positive
"First off I'm gonna lay this on the table-I'm a big Dario Argento fan.  I""m actually a big, geeky Argento fanboy. As a matter of fact, Argento is my favorite film director.  Even got to meet him once.  So now that you know that, you'll probably assume that I tend to give many of his recent films the benefit of the doubt.  That's true, I do try to look for the positives, but I'm not deaf or blind-I am well aware that Argento's films have been a little.....lacking.... in the last decade or so.  It's the same kinda deal with guys like Romero and Hooper, where you don't really like to admit to yourself that they just aren't putting out very good stuff anymore.But I like to keep the faith.  I like to think that one day Argento will come out with something that'll kick us all in the teeth and make us forget about Phantom of the Opera or Giallo, or....take your pick.With a heavy heart I have to say that his version of Dracula just isn't that movie.  I mean, hell, the idea sounds great in theory, doesn't it?  Dario Argento taking on Dracula?  Of course in this daydream, it's the Suspiria era Argento taking on Dracula that I'm imagining, not the Mother of Tears/Giallo director.  So, yes, the idea of Argento doing a Hammer-esque movie sounds great.  But it isn't.If this film didn't already have Argento's name slapped onto it, I'd have had no idea he had directed it.  There's really nothing about it that says, ""This is a Dario Argento movie""-except for maybe his daughter baring her breasts.  What would a post 1993 Argento movie be without Asia showing us her boobs and/or butt?  In fact, this movie looks like something you'd see on the Syfy channel.  Syfy Channel Presents Dracula!  I would have guessed that before Argento had I gone into this totally ignorant.Thomas Kretchmann  makes for one of the most unmemorable movie Draculas of all time.  I kinda like the fact that Argento decided to try an actor who didn't fit the stereotypical Dracula look......but he still isn't good.  In fact, nobody here is that good.  Hauer just barely reaches good.There is way too much CGI in this film.  You want to instantly ruin a film for me, throw in some CGI, especially in places where it is totally lazy and unnecessary-like showing a spider crawl through it's web.  Or flies buzzing around a room. Or how about the silly CGI ""WHOOSH"" that accompanies Dracula when he's supposed to be moving fast?  Like in the scene where he charges into Harker's room and attacks him!  Find me someone who thinks this looks good and I'll eat my Official Sun Records baseball cap.  CGI has no place in a horror film to begin with, and while it looks lifeless and flat when done ""well"", it's especially irritating when it's lousy, as it is here.What the hell happened here?  What's happened to Dario Argento?  I'm not giving up on the guy, but something really went wrong here.  Unfortunately this will be a lot of peoples' first exposure to Argento.  If you're one of these people, please don't think this is a great representation of Dario Argento's work.  That would be like judging Judas Priest solely by the Turbo album.I'm a bit let down, but I know Argento still has a great one in him.  Lets just hope he doesn't try for Frankenstein next, though.",Negative
"I am so glad I was able to watch past seasons to present.  I could only put down my tablet long enough to recharge the battery.  Watched in 2 days and now caught up to now watch this Season.  I just love the characters, and how they feel like a real family.  Wish they'd have more shows like Parenthood.",Positive
Shonda Rhimes writes like nobody else can or ever has on a tv show you never know where the next episode is going because it always goes where you didn't expect.,Positive
"I love science fiction TV shows as it is based on Stephen King Novel. I actually like to read Stephen King Novel books, too. Every time when TV show comes from the Stephen King novel then I will go for it to watch it anyway.Haven TV show never bored to watch anyway... I have been watching from Season 1 to 4; from what I understand Haven should have one more season to go for Season 5. I read article about Haven on the internet.",Positive
"This is weird, creepy, eerie, and wonderful. It is not a blood and guts movie but it is creepy, I really enjoyed it. The plot is excellent, the movie very well done with top notch special effects, and outstandind acting, I watched it twice",Positive
And this carries own the tradition nicely. For the best that HB did this makes it close to the top of my list.,Positive
"I hope that the transgender issue can be treated respectfully and doesn't become a very stereotypically comedic punch line.  If the story is treated from a place of love and portrays the kids struggle to accept the transformation I can see this becoming a very, very good show and I would definitely continue watching it.  I have the utmost respect for those who are strong enough to be honest about who they are deep inside and I'm interested to see how his self-involved kids deal with it.  I'm pulling for this show and I love Jeffrey Tambor and the rest of the cast seems great as well.",Positive
"And, make them longer.  The show is very funny.  If they can keep the quality, it has the potential to be a favorite series.",Positive
The season ended on a real thriller.  It left a number of situations and questions up in the air and unanswered.  Great writing and expansion of characters.  Like the local shots of Portland too.,Positive
"I really like being able to watch the entire season at one time (although not necessarily at one sitting). Great character development and plot twists. I was married to a detective for 50 years, so much of this rings true, although I don't think he would have liked the program.",Positive
"The battle between good and evil continues, it is up to the beholder to decide how clear the boundary between the two. Thecharacters are complex, rendered very lifelike, the series is captivating (page turner if it were a book).",Positive
Acting not so great. Story line cheesy. The coven is awesome. Not engaging enough for me. Not my style. Sorry,Negative
"I thought this was well done. It has endless potential for humor and you love to hate the characters. It will need some romance or sympathetic character development for it have lasting power, but it should be made.",Positive
"It was suspenseful but not very realistic. I enjoyed watching it, and would recommend it.  I would watch more shows.",Positive
Great series. Police work with some twists and a lot of humor. I have really enjoyed this season and am looking forward to more.,Positive
"I don't know about you, but figuring out the plot of a show in the first 10 minutes or the direction of a season early gets very tiresome. Formula TV has become the norm, now in recent years we have been blessed with those exceptions like madmen, walking dead, house of cards, Breaking bad, et al. Rubicon somehow got buy me, and this show wouldn't be popular among most Americans because you have to invest some time in the first couple of episodes in character development, background, and general housekeeping. However, if you are willing to lend the director those couple of hours, in return you will receive some of the most Clancy like drama I have seen outside the pages of his books. Rubicon is one of those shows that I won't thickly forget. Even more exciting amazon has shown me more previously unknown shows I might like if I liked Rubicon. So enjoy.",Positive
"Every episode is a chance to enjoy a superb performances : bravo to director,show runner & casting agent! Catch up on Season 3 before the launch of 4",Positive
"...It gets better with age.  The writing just gets better and better, especially in season 2. At first is was easy to distinguish light from dark, but as you go along in the story, you'll find that there are shades of gray and shifting perspectives. This series has the potential to live for a few more seasons as long as the quality of the writing continues to escalate.",Positive
"IT is a new concept in law enforcement,a  casual ,laidback ,great looking guy,smart ,and refuses to wear a uniform, instead wears jeans ,t-shirts and tennis shoes..but in a very small  police department on the Florida east coast,he solves crimes with all the talents he learned back in Chicago as a high profile police detective...I love his co talented actors on the show..this is a awesome twist on the cops and robbers,style show..",Positive
I like that TU addresses early math skills in each episode and the animation is cute and colorful. I also enjoy that the show incorporates real child actors in the vein of Blue's Clues. My five year old and two year old really enjoy watching the show.,Positive
We bought this copy of SOA as a gift for someone. We are totally hooked on this show and can't wait for the next season to come out!,Positive
"Brilliant SciFi, every episode from concept to execution.  Good plots, nice character development, great casting.  Eventually, EVERYBODY will be watching this on their roku.",Positive
Loved it.  Laughed.  Cringed.  Laughed more.  Can't wait to see the development in future episodes.  Where are the - they ready yet?  ;),Positive
"The character development is awesome.It glorifies the business of law a bit, but it is built for entertainment. The strategies that go into the plot development are very heavy.  I appreciate the attention to detail on character development as well.",Positive
i live in a haunted house and these stories are very similar to what I experience on a daily basis.,Positive
"The show has:1. Poor acting for some individuals in the show.2. Very an usual reactions for some characters toward some events (not the mysterious characters)3. Slow reactions corresponding events, again for some characters in the story.4. Good directing for the show.5. Very beautiful CGI effects.In overall:The show has a potential. It could be enjoyable if you like social/drama shows.&#34;The dome&#34; is a supporting element and the main element is suppose to be the actions of people who are &#34;trapped&#34; under the dome.Note:I didn't read the novel by Stephen King about this event.",Negative
"Acting, story line, everything is great.  I've never noticed, when watching TV show series, that there is such a story line, due to the constant and rude commercial breaks.  It's such a shame that commercial TV is so full of commercials!  For years now I've been recording favored TV shows and fast forwarding through the commercials.  Watching here with Amazon Prime streaming videos, it is so much more relaxing to have the 10 seconds of black - though that could probably be cut down to 5 seconds - than being interrupted with commercials for ridiculous things.I'm happy to pay a bit to watch an interesting show without commercials, rather than paying a lot each month for so many commercials and things I don't want to watch.  Streaming videos, YEA!I LIKE THE SHOW &#34;ELEMENTARY&#34; A LOT!",Positive
"If you are a fan of the Inspector Morse series, and mourned the passing of John Thaw at the young age of 60 - who was recently voted by British viewers as #3 in the best 50 actors over the past 50 years - you probably know that the show has been revived in the form of a prequel.  The first season was outstanding, and now the second is maintaining the same unrelenting quality, which isn't easy to do.John Thaw, as the older Morse, is clearly irreplaceable. His brooding, melancholy, curmudgeonly Morse captured the inspector's essence. Thaw's own life paralleled Morse's own with the loss of his mother's constant presence in his life at an early age when she left home and he didn't see her again until he was 19. The character Morse's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother died three years later. Did this life experience help Thaw to capture the depth and underlying strain of unresolved grief in Morse? Is this why Morse constantly falls for the women in his investigations, even when they turn out to be the culprit?But now we have the new younger Morse in this series Endeavour, which is a prequel to the iconic series. In the mystery novels, Morse's mother was Quaker which explains the origin of the name Endeavour. The real story is that the author Colin Dexter supposedly found the name on a building in which boats were housed along the river Thames in Oxford where he liked to walk. And the names Morse and Lewis actually came from arch-rival cross-word puzzle clue writers whom Dexter knew.Is this new endeavor in its second season worthy of the old series? Definitely yes. The younger Morse (Shaun Evans)is a tad gawky, as you imagine Morse probably was in his early days, but his enjoyment of fine cars, classical music,  crossword puzzles, literature classics is in evidence. The production values are superior to the old series, although the same wonderful iconic music remains. The sets for example--the police station, Morse's new rental, museums, boarding school, pubs - Anglophiles will be delighted in the authenticity representing 1960's England.  The cinematography is original with unusual flashbacks, angles of camera, perspectives or looking through a dirty car window as Morse steps out of a building. You feel the texture of England.  I watch it as much for the scenery as for the plots and actors.The actors are stand-outs: Endeavor's boss Thursday (Roger Allam) and the chief of police (Anton Lesser), the other police colleagues, and Morse's new possible love interest are splendid. Fun to watch Morse and Thursday's relationship develop. Since Morse doesn't have Lewis yet, Thursday fills in as the person to which he is closest and their relationship gives the series warmth. It is an inspired choice to use John Thaw's daughter as a newspaper editor - you can see a bit of her father's face in hers.The crimes are appropriately complex with original plots. So, even though we still miss Mr. Thaw, the actor Shaun Evans is maturing comfortably into the role of Morse. We hope the series will continue longer than the first incarnation of Colin Dexter's great books, which is probably my favorite mystery series.  If the quality continues, it certainly has the potential to last a long time for Inspector Morse's old and new delighted devotees.",Positive
"This is a neat cartoon that teaches kids to read. Good stories and twists on the classics, would recommend this series for preschoolers",Positive
"If you like the constant manuvering of the corporate world, this is for you. The personal stories fit well with the main storyline and frequently reflect eachother. Great stuff.",Positive
This is a docudrama about Henry the Eighth. There is a lot of action and beautiful people to keep you watching.I would not recommend this for children.Dr George Tomes,Positive
"Who is giving this five stars? Do you really want Amazon to think this is what passes as a hit. I am a die hard American Horror Story, Walking Dead, Revolution, Falling Skies, 28 Days later kind of guy. This is weak. The characters are so cliche they may be totally new again. They are going to have to amp this turd up or flush it.",Negative
I think this show is great but wonder at times what the rest of the world thinks of Americans they watch it. Does Putin watch this show? Is that why he keeps testing us?,Positive
"Best TV series I have seen since Seinfeld!  I don't say that lightly. Very funny and clever.  I haven't laughed out loud from watching the television in a very, very long time.  Highly recommend :)",Positive
"(Spoiler alert)When Rick and the Governor were locked in a final tussle, they were (unknown to the characters) battling for the entertainment value of the series. If one lives, the series stays awake, as it had been for two great episodes. If the other lives, it goes back to sleep. The trusty Gov' had already beheaded the second-most annoying character in our cast; now he was on the verge of truly freeing us from earnest tragic overload...But they KILLED him off. When it began, ""Walking Dead"" was great fun, because it reveled in the things that a good horror story can do. The guy trapped under the tank surrounded by zombies was just what we want with our popcorn. But it slowly morphed into this preachy tale of whining, goody-goody characters who are always worried about morality. These solemn, sermonizing bores. Horror is supposed to set us free, by loosing our demons. We want mayhem. We want people to do the wrong things for the wrong reasons. We want the savage battle of the instinctual. Let's face it, normal life is so stifling; we civilized folks have to hide our inner thoughts and desires, but in good horror stories they are given free rein and we can relax and laugh at how awful we just might be. The Governor was the only character who made this series feel alive. When he came back on the scene, we were enthralled, because we never know what he will do next - but we know it will be ruthless, amoral, and will serve his compulsion to defend HIS people against anyone else's people.So they kill him off, apparently because ""right"" must win. He should have mowed down the whole tiresome Rick community, taken over the prison, and then eventually been annihilated by some bigger force -- either a more powerful ""Governor"" type or a plague of zombies. He can die in the end (like Mr. Hyde, like the werewolf in so many movies, like Dracula) but WHEN he dies, that has to be it. That's a wrap. Curtains. Instead we have the always sad, solemn, struggling, pathetic, moral, but above all boring Rick leading us into ever more maudlin pathways.The premise of the walking dead, after all, is preposterous. That brain tissue in this kind of dilapidated state, let alone starved for any nourishment, could animate a human body is beyond silly. And that's fine, that's what makes it okay to let our demons romp. But to try to stitch a serious story to such a premise is really inept. You can't have people agonizing over fine moral dilemmas and then going down to the fence to stab rotting heads with sticks. Please, writers, get it together. The premise just won't bear this pretentious level of drama. You have to keep a certain tongue in cheek.If I want Kumbaya, agonized soul-searching, or a pep talk for the United nations, I'll watch a documentary or a drama. But this is horror. This is sacred fictional ground. We have to giggle as we scream. And you guys have muffed it badly.",Negative
"Whoever got me hooked on this show sucks! I was trying, TRYING, to stay away from this show. I don't need another show to watch. I have enough to do without being drawn, SUCKED IN to another frelling TV show.*death glare* However, I am. The characters are three-dimensional. They screw up. They do good. They're trying to do what they can to survive. You root for them. I find myself in my chair doing pom-pom dances (and I'm not a cheerleader), telling these guys to keep going! Keep fighting. No, don't give up! Just keep moving. You can do this.As you can see, I really get into this show. And the way it ended, I just want to take the screenwriters and wring their necks. Well done, guys. Well done.",Positive
"24 is the most  fun series I have ever seen on tv.  I love keifer Sutherland and it appears to me that a lot of actors get good parts and get in a lot of acting.  Also this series has people, even the bad guys speaking articulately and very rationally.  We are seeing a show full of admirable people not a bunch of losers.  That must be a part of the popularity of the series.Note something else, these people comply with the human requirement  of pronouncing judgement.",Positive
"Amazon, once again, has brought to us a unique opportunity to view and enjoy a pre-release movie. I gotta love this program. Not only is this a great movie about good vs evil and redemption, but it never got boring. Even in the non-action sections, where scenery and dialogue ruled, it kept moving forward. The action scenes were terrific aided by the beautiful music score and the incredible actors. I remember James Purefoy from the early years in Mansfield Park to Rome and even George and the Dragon (which is pure fun to watch). Some say his work in the series The Philanthorpist  was weak and cheesy, but I say that the man can do his job very well. I actually own the series and have continued to enjoy it. I was confused at first to learn that this was originally filmed in 2009 then only a European release in 2010 and just now limited release in the US but on reflection, the financial situation being what it is, most major studios and production houses, try to bet on a sure thing, for a greater return. No matter what, this movie is a blast to watch, so make sure you have plenty of popcorn and enjoy yourself. Oh, in case your wondering, he does take his shirt off.",Positive
"Good bad guys, bad good guys, and the women that keep them motivated.  If you've seen seasons one and two you just need to know that the plot keeps changing and the thrills keep-a-comin' in Harlan County and beyond.Real (?) characters, unreal excitement and more great Elmore Leonard dialog.  Don't blame Raylan, Boyd, Dickie, and the bad guys from Detroit if you miss a couple of installments of America's Most/Next/Top Whatever. You been warned.",Positive
My 4 year old granddaughter watches this a lot and learns about animals she has never seen or heard of before. The program is tastefully done. I find it educational and entertaining for children of her age.,Positive
"Vikings is one of those shows that only come around in a blue moon. It has an excellent cast, great writing, and am amazing plot. If you are looking for action mixed with history and adventure than this is the show you have been looking for.",Positive
"&#34;I have a place about 30 min away, will you come with me there.&#34; A mysterious woman (Johansson) spends her nights driving around and seducing lonely men and taking them back to her place. While there though they discover she isn't what she seems. This woman is actually a visitor from another world. Slowly she begins to believe that she is actually a human and this feeling begins to change everything for her. This is a very difficult movie to explain. The best way I can do it is to say that this is a version of Species as if it was directed by Stanley Kubrick.  There is very little dialog and the movie is very deliberate in its pacing. Some if the scenes are just Johansson talking to random real people in Scotland and others are scripted but they flow together and it works. This movie isn't for the casual sci-fi fan though because it is &#34;weird&#34; for lack of a better word.  There isn't much talking, or even any real &#34;plot&#34; to speak of so that makes this very hard to talk about. If you have liked the recent Terrence Malick movies like Tree Of Life or To The Wonder then you may enjoy this. If you are looking for something to just put in and watch this isn't what you are looking for. Overall, sci-fi &#34;snobs&#34; will love this but as for everyone else it will be hit or miss. This is not a movie made for entertainment purposes, this is to artfully tell a story. I give this a C.",Negative
This show was rather interesting but once again for $7.99 a show and there's three--I personally wouldn't have paid for it.  If people enjoy watching these type of movies which is possibly BBC pay for a membership of $79.00 for a year---to date between my books and movies I have saved over $600 to watch these type of shows.  Where are you going to get a return on your money like this.  I do have 2 kindles and only permitted one free book that qualifies but the most of this money was saved on movies.,Positive
"I love this show. I really have nothing to say against it, it is amazing. I cant wait for season 4. Oh and I am not a zombie fan, really. I hate blood and guts and stuff jumpin out at you. But this show rocks.",Positive
This show is informative but extremely boring. It seemed to drag.  We did not make it through the first showing.,Negative
the acting is great-i am from the south and i feel very at home with the way the characters are depicted and the dialogue is  rings true,Positive
"I can not believe that AMC didn't let this series have a second season.  It was one of the best shows television has to offer and ranks right up there with some of the British spy shows that excel far above our own.  It was a spectacular adventure full of excitement that kept you on the edge of your seat. I loved each one of the actors in their roles. The story is about Analysis done by a group of people who are able to ""connect the dots"" to protect the USA from foreign and domestic enemies willing to destroy our way of life.  It's a shame Showtime doesn't pick this up, because they would at least promote the series.  I didn't even realize it was on television until the first and final season ended.",Positive
"It gets a little corny at times, but they really do a good job.  Each episode is a murder mystery and there are several subplots to follow through the season.  Good acting.",Positive
"This show rocks in every way--the writing, the acting, the action.  This show predates &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;, but is just as good.  There's even a character who starts out &#34;good&#34;, but circumstances bring out her bad side...and that's great!!  Watch it!!",Positive
"I've been debating what I thought about this film since it finished a few moments ago. It's not your average film, and so much of it was puzzling, bizarre, weird and cool. However what I think has lead me to give it 2 stars is analyzing all the bots and pieces.First I asked myself why did I watch it? Well the trailer was interesting, it was in black and white, but modern, and looked like it was going to have some cool visual effects like Disneyland was going to be blown up. So it grabbed my attention fast, but what I actually got was not what I expected. It's not horror, and borderlines on creepy to weird, depending on if you are scared by your own shadow, or like me and nothing scares you. S it loses a point in lying to me in the trailer that this was going to deliver what I expected it to, destruction in Disneyland and cool visual effects. They are too few in this movie overall and nothing was really seen that wasn't in the trailer.Secondly I was fooled by all the review headlines on the cover like this movie should not exist, and what not. I thought someone was making a horror film in Disneyland or somewhat exposing the way Disney keep deaths in the park hush hush and secretive... but not, it turns out to be more of a drunk guys acid trip. So minus another star.The acting is not that bad, and the filming is OK. However could you walk away quoting something from this film or really remember a stand out performance or scene in itself? No, not really, I don't think many people will either.I think amongst the captivating weirdness and bizarre things going on, I was also being driven to keep watching wondering how they managed to film this thing? Did they actually do it in Disneyland, is it blue-screen effect with composted in the background, or was it a secret filming they did without Disneyland Florida's permission? But once the film was over, I asked myself two things.Did I enjoy the movie? Well, some parts where OK, but by the time it ended and answered a question I was wondering, I thought, no, it's not a masterpeice. Some people really think art house is making a film in black and white these days, and I really can not emphasize just how stupid I think that sort of thinking is. If you had a black and white TV, it still wouldn't make Survivor worthy of watching or call must see tv, so who cares if this thing is shot in B&W; or not? Some shots did remind me of the old b&w; days of television (seeing reruns of coarse) but just because you can shoot a few scenes with that nostalgia feel doesn't mean the film is overall a work of art. It's just reusing something used many, many, many years ago. Adding cgi into it is not original either.So coming away from the film, I asked myself the ultimate question. Would I watch it again? And the answer is no. Its not a gripping story, it's just something so weird you can sit through it the first time, but to watch it again isn't going to be like re-watching Back To The Future where you seem to always spot or pick up on something you missed before. This film is just not up there in that kind of great film making. So how can it possibly be a 5 star movie? Shouldn't that be reserved for movies so great you can watch them over and over and over again, and not just once, like this one?Overall i'm in limbo to vote it somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. I don't hate it, but I don't like it, it's in between somewhere as my feelings kept rocking up and down all the way through the film as it steered in one direction, then for no reason went another, and then reveals this and that, but in the end... it wasn't clever. I see right through the tricks people have applauded this movie for. I can't urge them enough to get out and see more movies, and not just find a turd like this one, pick it up and say, &#34;Oh, it smells ....different, therefor it must be special!&#34;... still, how much can you sell a fresh turd for on eBay?",Negative
"A king with four sons is dying, The King needs a successor, but whom should it be, which son? Each has different attributes and qualities, which the story reveals to the audience. I cared about the characters and what happened to them during their adventure. For me that's a winner. This movie has suspense, intrigue, injustice and justice along with a few surprises.I enjoyed ""The Hammer of the Gods"" because it's an exciting movie with complex characters, vivid setting, good plot, and a nice musical score (the whole nine yards).  I could watch it again and again. Oh, Charlie Bewley's haircut in this movie is simply beautiful!",Positive
"This is one of the best shows on TV and likely, the best legal show - bar none. Watch it!",Positive
"brisk plots,enjoyable characters and dialogue. the main actors are all very well cast in their roles.stories are written in an attention holding manner.",Positive
"As my review title goes, this was a great show.  Originally I thought it would be a comedy, but it's more of a drama with a lot of irony.  Not your typical formula show, which is why it was so cool but also probably why it got cancelled.  Very disappointed that they cancelled it halfway through the season (can anyone say &#34;Firefly&#34;?) with so many loose threads that will never be tied off.",Positive
"I really enjoy the Falling Skies series.  Anyone who likes Sci-Fi series, I would  recommend  they try this one out.I enjoy the plot line how a group is able to survive an alien attack; it is a plausible scenario not totally unbelievable .It shows groups of rebels who are able to use gorilla tactics and solidarity to hack away at the alien  occupation  of the Earth.  The special effects are pretty good; and I especially like the skitters and the kids who were used by the aliens but were freed of their control but can still communicate with them.  It also does a good job showing the relational dynamics between groups and individuals under a horrible and traumatic situation.",Positive
"You know one thing I dont understand about shows like this, you know wilderness survival and such, how come you are trying to go back to our roots and all,right?, so you use an axe to chop wood, but you have a gas operated chainsaw to cut trees down?, and you got a freaking snowmobile, but you try to make fire with two sticks?(no lighter), WTH man, I dont know what these people are thinking, including the producers. Whats the freaking point? If the point of the show is to show how they survive in the woods, using old school techniques, then why do you have a snowmobile? Why dont you show me how you survive with knife and an axe?",Negative
"""Eurekia"" was a totally entertaining series. I watched the entire series as I'd never seen it before. It was a bit fluffy, but in today's reality shows and crime drama, this was family friendly and didn't pretend to be anything it wasn't. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a program with engaging characters, suspense, at a reasonable price.",Positive

"The low budget horror indie ""Almost Human"" is not a movie that should be oversold.  When I picked up the Blu-ray with the requisite rave reviews (from Bloody Disgusting and Shock Til You Drop), I thought I might have found a small gem.  Truthfully, though, I think I would have enjoyed the movie a bit more discovering it on my own without preconceived notions.  This little movie borrows elements from a seventies slasher film and combines them with an alien abduction theme and throws in some classic Body Snatcher moments for good effect.  The idea, itself, works terrifically well but I'm not sure the film was always as clever or as original as I might have hoped.  After an intriguing beginning, my interest in the movie really started to wane.  The body of the movie really lacks mystery or surprises, it's just a rampant killing spree (in which a larger dose of humor would have helped immeasurably).  It isn't until the final confrontations, though, that the movie truly came alive.  A couple of wacky moments (alien mating) really enliven matters and caused me to add an extra star to my rating.Slight Spoilers (but nothing that would surprise you if you read the Blu-ray/DVD cover):As I said, I quite liked how ""Almost Human"" began right in the thick of the action.  We meet Seth Hampton (Graham Skipper) as he is driving as if the devil himself is chasing him.  When he arrives at the home of his good friend Mark (Josh Ethier), he spins a harrowing tale of abduction and pursuit.  Before Mark can truly comprehend what's happening, electrical disturbances and a mysterious blue light come to visit.  And before you can say boo, Mark becomes one of the missing.  What happened?  If you expect a mystery to unfold, the screenplay takes us in an alternate direction.  Years fast forward, and Seth is haunted by what happened.  He starts to have strange premonitions about Mark and he tracks down Mark's old girlfriend (Venessa Leigh) to share his concerns.  Mark, meanwhile, has returned (in some form or another) and is making his way back home leaving an escalating body count in his wake.  All of this is so matter-of-fact.  The murders aren't a mystery, what happened to Mark is not really important, and the killing sequences lack imagination.End Slight Spoilers.I will say this, however, writer/director Joe Begos clearly loves this genre of filmmaking.  You could sense his enthusiasm for the subject and how much respect he wanted to show it.  Therefore, when the final act rolls around, I'm pleased to say that the fun quotient goes up quite a bit.  When the three central characters square off, a number of moments made me laugh out loud.  It's fast paced and amusing, I just wish the rest of the movie had been so energetic.  This being a low budget endeavor, the effects aren't elaborate but they are effective enough.  And although none of the actors will win any awards (except maybe a diner waitress who is truly awful in her one line), they handle the action moments well.  I especially liked Skipper.  In the end, ""Almost Human"" is a pleasant enough experience with modest expectations.  It's not a new horror classic, but it has a nice payoff in its ending.  KGHarris, 6/14.",Negative
"Surprisingly good movie!  Let's be real, though.  The story is a bit predictable--but not totally so.  The love story is rushed and a bit melodramatic--but not vomit-inducingly so.  Relationships form naturally.  The scenes are believable and enjoyable.More importantly, the action is highly entertaining.  The fight scenes are well-choreographed.  The special effects are impressive!  When the volcano starts its troubles, wow!  You will get to see some incredible disaster scenes.  While you wait, you get gladiator battles worth re-watching.  Good violent stuff.As far as the acting goes, you can expect solid performances.  This is not B-movie trash.  Very well-done.  The settings as well  are beautiful and gritty, very accurate.Definitely worth renting.  This is not a waste of money by any means.  Yes, it veers from history a bit.  But not enough to complain.

"I've been an ardent fan of the show from the beginning, of the extraordinary cast in particular (they get 5 Stars!)- in seasons one and two I waited each week with baited breath for the next episode. But even though I want to see what happens next, and I'm watching season three, some things have troubled me about the show from the start. I've thought about it quite a bit, and though I'm not sure how well I can express it, I'll try. [NOTE: There's an update at the end of my review.]I read recently that the director Sidney Lumet said ""In a well-written drama, the story comes out of the characters. The characters in a well-written melodrama come out of the story."" Though I'm still puzzling over what this means, exactly, by that definition I'd say Once Upon a Time is a melodrama, in that it is plot-driven, rather than character-driven. I think in the best works, in any genre, a great story zigzags back and forth between drama and melodrama, i.e., between plot and character development, each seamlessly informing and enriching the other. ONCE is woefully inadequate in the character development department. The characters are one-dimensional. These fantastic actors (and we fans) deserve so much more.Before you say ""They're fairy tale characters, for goodness sake, what do you expect?"" I expect good drama- character development to rival, complement mythic themes. In thinking about the show, it finally dawned on me that the character neglect reminds me of the cognitive deficits in certain syndromes. In autism, for example, especially Asperger's Syndrome, one thing that characterizes many patients is a preoccupation with the trees to the exclusion of the forest. Such patients focus for hours on separate parts, on the mechanics of things. An analogy might be someone intent on cataloging the stars in the sky, one after another, but being unable to appreciate the majesty of the cosmos, feel a sense of awe and wonder when appraising the night sky in its entirety.Similarly, in Oliver Sacks's wonderful book THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HAT, he describes the behavior and bizarre ""reality"" of patients who've suffered right-hemisphere brain damage. What remains is the left hemisphere, and the way it processes info is by parts and feature analysis. Lacking the right brain, which puts everything together, sees relations, wholes, and attaches feelings and significance to perceptions and events, the left brain focuses on sequential details, linear analysis, which results in a very odd and unsatisfying experience for those affected, sadly. Indeed, patients with Asperger's and RH damage tend to have great difficulties with personal relationships, their perceptual blinders rendering them unable to apprehend other people in all their complexity. People who love them often find interactions extremely frustrating.ONCE reminds me of that brand of reality, a focus on the machinations of the plot, with scant appreciation of the depth, profundity and emotional complexity of human beings, both individually and in concert with each other. The characters' major function is to drive the plot forward, it's the plot itself that take precedence, like a big math problem (albeit at times an intriguing one).The antithesis of this, for me, might be the pithy, splendid TV Series THE CROW, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN or the movie FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY. They succeed as both superb melodrama and superb drama, emotionally affecting, weaving intricate plot lines and characters into tapestries that become far more than the sum of their parts.And another observation, at the risk of sounding sexist- I can't help but wonder if the fact that all the writers on the show are male doesn't contribute to this preoccupation with mechanics and linear details (research has shown that left brain processes tend to predominate in males, whereas females tend to use both hemispheres in tandem). Seriously, if I didn't know better I'd swear the show was written by a bunch of 14 year-old boys with high-level Asperger's Syndrome (some Asperger's folks have high IQs, see the world in simplistic, black and white terms, but construct super-elaborate scenarios around simplified themes from which they're loathe to deviate).[Update: I stand corrected- as others kindly pointed out, they've corrected that situation and have hired female writers, I'm happy to learn.] Fairy tales have traditionally been the province of girls, much more so than boys. Granted, most fairy tales were recorded &/or collected by men, but I've always pictured them being offered as gifts, infused with hopes and dreams, by mothers down through the ages, told as bedtime stories, a feminine oral tradition fueling their children's- especially their daughters'- imaginations. I DO applaud the writers for depicting strong, heroic women, kudos for that. All I know is that what l most love about fairy tales...isn't here, it's missing.Were I the head writer on the show, I'd ensure that the writers focus less on the dizzying intricacies and pyrotechnics of the plot (could it BE more pointlessly complicated??), and slow down a bit, putting flesh on characters' bones and exploring relationships between them. Can you do that without sacrificing clever plot twists, and while still showing what's happening with multiple characters? Sure, ST. ELSEWHERE, for example, did it spectacularly well (the best TV show ever, I think)- and the hit show BORGEN too, from Denmark. And actually, come to think of it, another offering starring Ginnifer Goodwin, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, also succeeded in that respect (at least I think so, not everyone liked it as much as I). In a review of it it was noted that even a brief scene in which Bradley Cooper declined Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette bespoke volumes about the characters (while also advancing the plot), no wasted moments. Anyway, the marvelous actors on ONCE deserve such character development and subtlety, that's what I'm waiting for, yearning for, anyway...Then again, when I'm feeling a little less magnanimous, I wonder if maybe the writers and producers don't know EXACTLY what they're doing. Now and then there's this nagging feeling that somehow I'm being made a fool of, that maybe someone's having a good laugh at my expense. Why would ANYONE stick around, year after year, given so few crumbs, on a mere promise of something that never seems to materialize? Where's the payoff for my attentiveness, my loyalty? Perhaps some suit said: ""Mix up the metaphors! Throw in everything but the kitchen sink, THAT'LL keep 'em guessing. Hell, we can even call it a new GENRE!"" Or: ""Just toss around a few buzzwords, you know, true love, true hearts, true WHATEVER...human imagination being what it is, they'll supply their OWN profundity. HEY! How about SAVIOR- it's LOADED with associations, throw THAT in!"" Could there be a standing bet as to how long the show can be drawn out, how much profit can be amassed, how much convoluted but simplistic DRIVEL can be heaped on hapless fans before they begin to get wise? You know the old saying, you can fool some of the people... I haven't given up on ONCE yet, but I'm getting awfully close.UPDATE: The show continued in much the same vein, until Episode 4, Quite a Common Fairy- smashing, brilliant, exactly the kind of stories, with the interpersonal punch, I've longed for. If the show continues with this kind of writing I'll be one happy fan.

"They have been smart enough to bring some of the players from the original Primevil back in to mix with the new group and give it some crossover appeal.  The British version did kill off some great actors with great dyamics and I lost a little flavor with it, but stuck through to the end and it wound up being pretty good.  I am a little loss as to why the characters crossing over aren't providing more help or at least some gear.",Positive

Then I found myself one day wanting to watch something new and decided to give this show a go.  Wow!  I found the lead actor to be sexy in a very subtle way.  I loved that he didn't over act his part.  The rest of the cast is just as stellar.  The script was fantastic.  I loved this show!

"Vikings is a tamer Rome.  (given the station, it is understandable)We will start with the bad:The characters are sometimes hard to follow as they seem to want to try and break the stereotype mold.  The obvious villain stays obvious, but the obvious turncoat(s) turns out good, but then not so, then is so, then not so again.  It made it a little tough to cheer for a character or not.  You feel bad for them one minute, then they completely go against the grain for seemingly no reason.The relationships built between the initial raiding party are hinted at being tight but the show does not bother to explore them and instead uses the raiding party as fodder to fuel other storyline developments.  They work like expendable family members.The fight scenes are just not that good.  You can see the obvious scene stops in each fight sequence and the over-all choreography is just too slow.  The actors seem like they are afraid to actually HIT.  You don't see the &#34;fighting like demons&#34; aspect that is talked about.All of that said...  The Good.The story, for me, was compelling though obvious.  Its an interesting look into the life of Vikings while following a potentially fictitious hero, Ragnar.  (People still debate whether he was real or an amalgam of other Norse heroes)  His son, unlike Carl in the walking dead, is not an insufferable pain to see on screen, and his wife actually adds something to the story.  The customs and legends are great and interesting to follow up on in your spare time.  The acting is pretty good, though Travis Fimmel's facial expressions tend to confuse the situation.  That said, I do like the way he is playing Ragnar.For a first season, it is not bad and I will be tuning in for a second season when it finally drops.  It is not good enough to rave over, or to rush home to see at it's regularly scheduled time slot, but it is good enough to watch start to finish via Prime.  Hopefully the second season will delve a little deeper into the opening sequence and provide a little more of the raiding that is talked about so heavily in the first season.",Negative
I find this series both informative and controversial.  Its very interesting to learn about our ancient past and be presented withtheories about extraordinary happenings of the time. I have certainly open my mind to these theories and even if you don't care about the ancient alien aspect of the series. Its still has a lot of good information about civilizations from thousands of years ago.,Positive

"Jonathan Ames, a writer of eccentric novels, penned the book on which this bizarre film is based.  His story of confused identities and searching for a workable concept of self was adapted for the screen by Ames with help from co-directors Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman.  It is a confusing tale to watch but has moments of comedic insight and a cat of well-known actors that help to make the film entertaining - if a bit of fluff.We meet English teacher Louis Ives (Paul Dano) after a prelude of daydreaming the three factors that characterize Louis  - his obsession with  classic literature of the 1920s, his untrained perception of how to relate to people (`awkward' would be a kind term), and his penchant for fantasizing about cross dressing. He is dismissed from his school `due to budget cuts' (read `having been discovered trying on a bra and being caught by the headmaster'), yet his inappropriate response is one of glee at having been given the opportunity to move to Manhattan to become a writer.Once in New York City without connections, he answers an ad for an inexpensive apartment sharing - the ad having been submitted by one very strange Henry Harrison (Kevin Kline), an older down on his heels writer and playwright who supports himself teaching college level literature and who considers himself an aristocrat, serving as an `escort' for older wealthy women.  After an uncomfortable interview Henry consents to allow Louis to be his roommate: after weighing his options Louis accepts the room in the flea infested filthy apartment and begins trying to get to know the secretive and zany Henry.Henry provides companionship for one Vivian (Marion Seldes) and eventually Louis is brought in as an `extra man' to provide companionship for one of Vivian's friends (Celia Watson).  In the meantime Louis finds work as a telephone salesman for a Green magazine, meets the pretty but unavailable Mary (Katie Holmes), begins to encounter Henry's entourage of loonies such as Henry's bearded and dirty repairman Gershon (John C. Reilly), and gives in to his urge to learn about cross-dressing by visiting a `teacher ` and finally a make-over artist who places him in the role of a `woman'.  Louis' experience with transvestism fails and alienates Henry - for a brief time.  But what this comedic episode results in is Louis' discovery of what is important - friends and family - and Henry and his entourage supply that and the changes this brings in all the characters draws the film to a close.With a cast such as this we find ourselves wanting to connect with each character - bizarre though they all are - and to a degree this occurs.  But the script is spotty and the direction is bumpy and in many ways it feels as though the film simply never gets off the ground.  Good moments: no after taste to savor.

"Special Features: ""The Devil's Roadmap"", ""Webisodes"", three commentary tracks, gag reel, deleted/unaired scenesThere was no witchcraft involved in the success of ""Supernatural"". The show benefited from top notch writing, direction and performances with just the right dash of quirky humor to offset the horror elements of the show. The second season of the show picks up right where the first ended. Dean (Jensen Ackles) and Sam (Jared Padalecki) have located their dad  (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and have the fabled gun fashioned to kill demons in their possession. The trio confront the Demon that killed Dean and Sam's mom only to find it leaping from person to person finally possessing their father almost forcing the boys to kill him. Driving the Demon out of their father the trio escape with the gun believing that they can still track down the creature, find out why it has harvested children with special psychic abilities and how it plans on using them in its ""war"" against humanity. Then a truck hits Dean's 1967 Impala. Sam is injured but alive and Dean is on the cusp of death with internal injuries. John makes a deal with the Devil or, in this case, the Demon they were pursuing--take his life for Dean's. Before he dies John whispers something to Dean which will resonate throughout the rest of the second season.We get three commentary tracks on ""In My Time of Dying"" (director Kim Manners and actors Ackles & Padalecki), ""What Is And Should Never Be"" (writer Eric Kripe) and the first part of the season two finale ""All Hell Breaks Loose"" (Kripke, Manners and writer Sera Gamble) along with deleted/unaired scenes on three episodes.""The Devil's Road Map"" is exactly that; a map of the United States showing where each episode takes place in the country You can click on each spot and see material from John's book with writers like Whitley Striber discussing the various monsters. We also see behind-the-scenes footage of the writers/producers discussing the creation of various episodes such as ""All Hell Breaks Loose"". These are essentially featurettes on each episode and they are kind of cool.  We also get Jared Padalecki's original screen test on videotape. The quality of the screen test is typical for home video cameras as it was really never intended to be shown. It's kind of cool to be able to contrast his first take on the character vs. the final performance from the pilot episode and subsequent character development over the course of two seasons.We also get three ""webisode"" featurettes including ""The Inside Scoop with Ivan Hayden/VFX Supervisor"" discussing the visual effects of the show, the overall look of these effects and how he approaches integrating the visuals into the show. ""Inside the Writer's Room"" which also aired on the ""Supernatural"" website during season two features writer/creator/producer Kripke, writer/producer John Shiban and producer/writer/director Robert Singer where the trio point out that the show uses Urban folklore as the basis for most of their episodes. Sadly we can't see the board with story ideas behind them. We also get glimpses of some of the storyboards including plenty of clips from the second season. ""The Inside Scoop with Chris Cooper"" is the final webisode included and features the prop master for ""Supernatural"" who discusses ""all the toys"" that the cast use on the show. Cooper discusses some of the fun stuff he gets to create including the guns and devices that Dean & Sam use. The amusing gag reel rounds things out including a very funny scene where Padalecki has a practical joke played on him during shooting.""Supernatural"" looks extremely good overall with nice color reproduction and detail. There are some digital artifacts and the images do blur a bit when there is rapid action on screen (which could be due to the fact that the show is shot and mastered in HD although it largely captures the ""look"" of film) but on the whole the show looks quite good.An exceptional second season with only a few dud episodes, I'd highly recommend the ""Supernatural"". The show has hip humor that manages to capture much of the fun elements that made ""The X-Files"" so memorable (and hard to reproduce as the failed but interesting ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" from 2005 demonstrated). As with the previous the discs are housed in a fold out case with a brief synopsis and credits for each episode.",Positive
"This show is full of entertainment, I'm not real sure if any of it is real ,but I tune in to watch every bit of it.",Positive
"This one is a little difficult to watch; while there are a few interesting moments there seem to be an abundance of meaningless filler moments that are difficult to watch. At midpoint I had to stop it and recover before I could go on with the movie the next day. You may well ask why I bothered and the only answer I can provide to that question was a slight curiosity how it would end.A little over half way through the movie starts getting a little more interesting as the two leads start their return to the USA. A serious libido problem on the guy's part causes them to miss a vital connection on their return trip and choose an alternate route home through dangerous territory.Much of the story is told after dark so the demands on the cgi are correspondingly reduced. In its favor there are some effective scenes showing life in the Mexican villages and some of the sequences are marginally interesting.Now let's consider another possibility; what if the alien monsters were symbolic of drug cartels, what if the whole thing is an allegory for the current situation with drug cartels in Northern Mexico? If one thinks in those terms there are some interesting parallels; for example the efforts of the United States to protect itself with a wall. Another would be the infected zones and their parallel with areas controlled by the cartels. The alien monsters had long tentacles which is similar to the tentacles of influence exercised by the cartels. The monsters were most active after dark which also characterizes the cartels. In those areas attacked by the monsters there was much devastation which is also a goal of the cartels. Another parallel are the evacuated zones in the United States; there are already areas of Arizona where citizens are warned not to go, are these infected zones perhaps?I've not seen any suggestions that the allegorical nature of Monsters is intended to reflect Northern Mexico's drug problem but it does make for some interesting speculation.If you are a dedicated sci-fi fan you may want to watch it just so you can say you did or you may want to check me out on my allegory speculation. I would be interested in hearing from any of you who care to investigate the possibility.",Negative

"Wow. I feel completely different from most of the reviews here that state that the third season for ""In Plain Sight"" left them disappointed; I felt that it was a natural outgrowth ofIn Plain Sight: Season Twoand just as strong as the first two.SPOILERS:Season two opens with Mary (Mary McCormack)recovering from the gang shooting that nearly killed her at the conclusion of season two. She's uncertain where her relationship with Raf(Cristi&aacute;n de la Fuente)is going even though she accepted his proposal and she's frustrated because she can't recall the face of her shooter. Marshal (Frederick Weller)feels guilty because he wasn't there for her like she was for him when he was shot previously. She returns uncertain of how she should feel and wanting to jump right back into her witsec responsibility.END OF SPOILERS:The third season continues to be as entertaining filled with the droll humor of the first two seasons.I particularly liked the episode ""When Mary Met Marshall"" where we see how the two first met and how Mary was brought into Witsec.The DVD looks quite nice with a very good looking transfer. Audio sounds quite good as well.This season has some nice extras (although fans don't buy the show for that reason necessarily) including commentary tracks on ""Father Goes West"" Commentary with Series Stars Mary McCormack and Frederick Weller and ""A Priest Walks Into a Bar"" Commentary with Series Stars Mary McCormack and Frederick Weller (so someone must have been reading the reviews complaining about no commentary tracks). We also get deleted scenes, cast interviews and a photo gallery. I would have (**hint**hint**) a featurette or two on the production of the series and/or the storylines for each season, etc.Why doesn't the show get five stars? There were a few episodes that were a bit predictable in terms of the outcome and I'd like to see the writers take more chances with the characters/plots. Also, the boxed set could use a couple of featurettes on the production of the series just for fun.This is another exceptionally good season of the series. As with previous seasons even the weaker episodes flow and work well because of the chemistry of the main cast particularly the outrageously funny McCormack and Weller. McCormack and Weller are hilarious with great onscreen presence.Highly recommended.",Positive

"There's somewhat of a return to the Leave It To Beaver days here, without being outdated and corny.The strength of this show lies in the love this family shows for one another (You know, despite the parents being divorced and all...)The kids listen to their parents, and learn valuable life lessons when they don't.The father shows how you can overcome any adversity and thrive if you are determined enough.The mother....well Jenna Elfman's charcter needs a little more substance. But that's kind of her character, a woman who doesn't really know who she is. She's starting again after her marriage ends.I'm not sure the parents really need to be divorced to make the show work though. It adds an element that doesn't really need to be there, other than to give the blind father a reason to be on his own more. That is an important element to the show.",Positive
Everything about this series is implausible.  A lawyer that wins every time by pulling a stunt at the last second.  A protege that is smarter than any human yet needs his mentor and otherwise wouldn't fit into society.  A sexy paralegal that always looks great and is never actually available.The acting is great - first rate.The bad thing is the show transmits the notion that one gets ahead by making up clever lies on the spot.,Positive
"Playback is not a scary movie. It didn't build any tension and the jump-out scares didn't work. The acting was about average, and so was the music. The story is what stood out to me and basically saved this movie. It's not really like The Ring, although it does have some elements from it. The story is actually creative and has some decent twists at the end. The tape in Playback basically possess those who watch it and the tape goes back for generations in the family. The film is based around teenagers, but isn't like your average teenage slasher. The intro was violent and probably the best part of the film, by the way.If you have time to kill or are slightly interested in this movie, check it out on Amazon Prime or Netflix streaming (available on both as of 6/15/12). Don't expect anything too scary cause you may come out disappointed.The movie has gore, sexual references, nudity and some frightening scenes.",Negative
Don't like scary stuff my kids probably watched it. They love scary movies. I can live without them. They loved it.,Negative
"The Parks and Recreation Department employees in the fictional mid-western town of Pawnee manage to get themselves into and out of ridiculous situations every week.  This is usually due to the whacky logic and misplaced enthusiasm of the Deputy Director as played by the talented Amy Pohelr. This show is consistently amusing, but seldom laugh out loud funny.  The leads are usually good although the departure of Rashida Jones and Rob Lowe created a gap that has yet to be successfully filled. The supporting cast is also good and  the production values are low budget but OK.  However, the writing seldom rises to the level of shows like &#34;The Office&#34; and &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34;.  All that said, it still remains notably above the level of most TV comedy.",Positive
"Season 2 of Gavin and Stacey another step of this great situation comedy.  Not since the best addictive television comedies like Seinfeld and Cheers before it, has there been such a show worthy of a dedicated following--and sadly America doesn't even know about it. I just happened upon Gavin and Stacey and after a couple shows, I watched all 3 seasons of it in 3 days. The best aspect of this show is that there are truly talented actors who wholly inhabit their characters.  The most annoying, off-putting, characteristic of any show for me, particularly a comedy, is when an actor is constantly aware of what he's doing--the audience is watching him act.  His/her, ego is on full display completely thrilled at this opportunity to strut his stuff in a show.  That doesn't happen in Gavin and Stacey.  Some of these characters are over the top, and you believe them, even love them for their idiosyncrasies.  Gavin and Stacey are two very nice people, who you might know.  They are genuine and sweet and innocently funny.  But the characters that surround them--their families and friends--are straight-up crazy, funny, flawed, sweet, loving, honest people--just like your aunts, uncles and friends.  Pam, Gavin's mom, so mom-ish--loving her prince of a son, sexy with her husband, sometimes trying to be who she isn't, giving and selfish, fussy and warm--is simply funny.  Smithy, Gavin's best friend, is somewhat rotund, cutting back on his eating with a 6-pack of chicken, corn on the cob and other sides, at the end of a night of partying; always greets Gavin with a shared hip-hop song and choreography--with Gav's mom and dad joining in when they're around--quite capably, I might add; rolling on the floor in a tussle with his younger sister--another hip-hop master; and, an all-round hysterically funny good guy!  Brin, Stacey's uncle, is embodied by Rob Brydon, from The Trip...OMG, I adore him... Brin lingers just a minute too long when he hugs Gav, and he is harboring some secret experience...that happened on a fishing trip with his nephew, Stacey's brother...it was very cold on that trip... And, last but certainly not least, Nessa, Stacey's best friend.  Nessa is a hearty (like Smithy) Welsh lady, who is completely blunt in her honest, slightly stilted, take on the world.  She can assist her bouncer friends at the local night club, and go head-to-head with Smithy on a KFC mega meal, where a butter-dripping ear of corn becomes an unexpected bit of foreplay.  The only thing that an American audience might take a bit of getting used to are the British and Welsh accents...but please, give it a minute...the Welsh accents become another great joke.  This only negative about this comedy is that there are not 5 more seasons to hang out with these people.  This is a great, funny and very warm ensemble show.",Positive
"This series allows you to step back one hundred years into the days of no antibiotics, no surgical masks or gloves, and the painkiller of choice was morphine. Also, cocaine was legal! The main characters are doctors and nurses, struggling to do the best they can for their patients within the strict social guidelines of the Victorian age.",Positive
"What a great show. The characters are perfect for their roles and I can't imagine anyone else doing a better job especially the villains.Every Network and practically every New show run promos stating that it's the number one show everyone is raving about. The Blacklist is the real deal.  Not for the faint hearted, but definitely the next level after all of the profilers, investigators and U.S. Marshals have got their &#34;man&#34;.  Definitely worth the price of the movie pass to be able to watch commercial free.",Positive
"I found this show totally by accident, decided to give it a try. I found it very enjoyable, I watched the whole season in 3 days. I found the format very intriguing. I look forward to next season!",Positive
"I have watched every episode of Grimm and some I have watched twice.  Every episode is directed by a different person and each and every episode is great,  Hats off the Grimm cast & crew.",Positive
"I don't know what I think of Bosch yet and I think I need to care about him. I don't know if he did murder the man instead of being in fear of his life and shooting a man. His character is not clear. Being cleared by the LAPD is not necessarily actual clearance and the civil court case for money doesn't give me any information to help find out if I like this man or if I respect him. Great detectives who go out of their way to figure out a case are always wonderful to watch. But if the dead child has hooked him since the doctor told him about the twist fracture because Bosch was an abused child, that is personal and doesn't constitute tenacious detective work. I don't know if I care if he wins the court case or not and I think I should. Too many people don't like him and I have not seen if that is because he is good at what he does or is just a bad guy.",Positive
"My granddaughter and I have been fans of Olivia for more than a year.  She's three.  When she recently questioned me about being a princess, I told her she is my princess.  I appreciated Olivia taking the princess theme in the right direction with the ""Princess Promise"". I want her growing up with strong values.",Positive
"This show reminds me of what is was like to watch TV in the 70s. In a good way. Longmire is the hero we all wish we were. He is stoic but not cold, loyal to a fault, and believes the work he does is a calling, not just a paycheck.",Positive
Waiting to see if it gets better.  It has a lot of possibilities and could be a really good show or not.  I will watch a few more episodes to decide.,Negative
I like the scripts but am not sure about the lead actor..sometimes I like his acting but I think it would be betterif he was a little more sarcastic. I know he has gottenvery wise in mind and body but with knowledge comes asense of humor and I would love to see him go just a littlebit more into what he is hinting at now...just a little more sarcasticafter all he has earned that no matter how grounded he hasbecome...The scripts are full of it I just wish he would take a littlemore advantage with the delivery..It needs that ZING!!! Forgiving isfine but complacent is just too much to ask..I'm thinking..But that's just me..,Negative
"I love this show!! Jay Ryan(I hate his real name Bunyan) and Kristin Kreuk have great chemistry. And, Jay is beautiful eye candy.",Positive
"It's stupid and a lame premise . No humor , no script and Diaz , Mann , Upton , etc is just pointless , directionless and just a brainless chick flick .",Negative
"An entertaining show full of zombies, witches warlocks with down to earth and other worldly situations. If you liked &#34;Charmed&#34; or &#34;American Horror Story: Coven&#34; you will like this show.",Positive
I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Please make more of the Scandinavian tv series available for prime members on instant video streaming.,Positive
"Obviously there are a lot of shows that try to accurately portray politics and this is a pleasant departure from that. It has small parts that I am sure are accurate, but mostly this show is just funny. It does a good job of providing comic relief from the daily headlines our politicians create. I have enjoyed each of the characters, especially John Goodman, since I am from North Carolina.",Positive

"My kind of video. Shows how resourceful one can be in extreme conditions, battling the cruel and real elements of nature. What I don't like to much is the switching scene locations and short time on viewing the characters in this exciting and thrilling exposure to the elements of danger. Beats looking at some fictional Hollywood production. Especially the garbage that's being produced for today's films.",Positive
This is the fourth year and it was as well written and filmed as the other three.  The characters are fantastic.  I think Edward Olmos has done a wonderful job in this series.  I liked this series better than the original with Lorne Greene.,Positive
"One of the few series that has kept the momentum going, plots are non-repetitive, engaging and very exciting. I want to know what happens next every minute of the film!!!!",Positive
"Overall this was a very good series. It was very well acted and the investigations were quite interesting. The only thing that gave me pause was the choices the main character made in her personal life. They seemed polar opposite of what someone who had achieved so much in their career would make, partially because the choices had impact on her career. It was a bit unbelievable and took away from my experience in watching the series for me.",Positive
"As someone who has a Master's level certification in sports counseling and have considered a Sports Psych doctorate, I thoroughly enjoy this show! Ordered new, it came in perfect condition.",Positive
much better than we thought it would be and definitely better than most kid tv out there. we're waiting for more!!,Positive
Awesome show.  The actors are great and we enjoy every episode.  The banter between the two mains is fun.  Bing watching can be difficult because now we want the next season and it's not on Prime.,Positive
"Gael is fantastic as usual. And the other actors are not left behind. The exiting maestro, the female director, the outgoing violinist... this is an excellently written story that seems to have more interesting things to come. I want to see  a  lot more! And the music is so beautiful. Will we see some dancing at Juilliard perhaps?This is a fresh story. Please, make more.",Positive
"Robert Miller is the hedge fund star with a very happy family, net worth in the billions and his face on the face of a very famous magazine. However Miller is planning to give it all up so that he can spend more time with his family.However this guy is not so nice, he leaves the house at night so that he can spend time with his french girlfriend Julie ( Laetitia Casta). on the other hand, he is neck deep into troubles stemming from an investment which went completely wrong. He owes creditors about half a billion dollars.One night, Miller and Julia get into an accident which kills her instantly. He manages to get help from the son of his former chauffeur to get away from the scene of the accident. The police instantly suspect him but cannot prove it. Miller is a bad guy yet you want him to win at all costs because at the heart of all his wrongdoings is a sincere need to help his family. Even though he get the drivers soon in trouble, we know that he has been good to them for many years.The cast is strong and Sarandon is great as the wife, initially I thought that she did not much to do but she delivers a strong comeback towards the end. Tim Roth was great in `Lie to Me' but could not fake the accent of a detective from NYC. Jimmy Grant as Nate Parker was the best thing about the film, a guy looking to make a fresh start but getting caught in the troubles of his past.  This is an enjoyable thriller with a great cast and surprising twists. Enjoyed it alot. 4 stars. 4/18/2013",Positive
"I liked the pilot, at least till the end.  This might be a good one if it doesn't get too weird.  It was a good mix of characters and all were interesting.",Positive
"I never watched Eureka while it was on TV so Ive spent the last few weeks binge watching and now I'm wondering why I wasn't watching it when it was on the air. Overall its a pretty good show, but having watched it all in a short amount of time has given me a little perspective too. I felt like the show was least interesting during the last part of season 2 and most of season 3, with a pretty good rebound for 4 and 5. I also enjoyed watching the show get a little more serious towards the end and wish it had more of that throughout the series. Yes, you have to suspend your disbelief a bit when it comes to the science and how Eureka manages to practically blow up the earth every episode, but its fun to watch. The end of the series was also one of the best that Ive seen for many tv shows out there and think they did a great job connecting the beginning and end of the series. I love the characters in the show and think they all did a great job playing their parts and working well together. Nathan Stark was a good character that I was sad to see leave and I really liked seeing Fargo go from being annoying to really being pretty bad ass at the end. The one real issue I had with the series was the Carter/Allison relationship just didn't work for me. Early in the series I could see it, but once she went back to Nathan Stark I disliked ever seeing them together. It really felt like Carter should have ended up with Tess or even Lupo more than Allison, but again, that's a storyline that goes back to the beginning of the show so we all knew it was probably going to end the way it did even if the show evolved to the point it probably shouldn't have happened. Overall Eureka is really fun to watch and worth seeing if you havent already.",Positive
The young detective known by her superior when a young girl pulls off exciting episodes one after another. In the end of this series they face a defeat together but their reactions to it are different. Enjoyable as well as provocative.,Positive
This is a really interesting premise--behind the scenes at an orchestra. The cast is quirky and interesting. i want to know more about them. Acting is very good. I really enjoyed it. I hope it gets picked up. I think it's better than most of what's on basic television.,Positive
"I've loved Shark Week since it's inception, and through the years I've come to truly appreciate sharks of all types.  That being said, I don't put myself in THEIR environment anymore.  It's theirs, they 'own' it, they dominate it and I'm all good with that.  Still, I love learning about them, seeing them and watching the experts try to being understanding to we laymen.  That, I think, is what Shark Week is all about, although they do always bring the attacks to the fore, but that's because we, the viewers, are rubberneckers at heart and want to see blood in the water.I hope all will watch, learn and express their appreciation for the apex-predator of our seas.",Positive
"I decided to watch this , not thinking I'd like it, and I did. So I bought the first season on Amazon Prime Video and have enjoyed watching the rest of the season, as I don't always get to watch episodes when they are shown.A few twists and turns which keep things interesting. A bit violent in places, but not overdone. It's easy to 'like' the characters, or most of them. A bit of human interest between the lines.Check it out - you may like it.",Positive
Southland is a good crime drama. It makes you feel for the characters.It feels real. Police dramas that tells all sides of the issues are worth watching.,Positive
"This movie is a must watch, along with the movie chow down. People, we are killing ourselves with what we eat. Go back to nature and live to be healthy and old. It teaches you how to spend as much time on earth as taught in the bible.",Positive
"Though the TV show is a bit hokey for adults, it is more than suitable for the little ones and the original Fresh Beat Band songs are fantastic.  This quad (which consists of 2 young ladies and 2 young men:  Kiki, Morena, Twist and Shout - lol) have great singing voices, dance, play their own instruments and are always using their social and cognitive skills to help each other solve whatever problems arise during a particular episode.  While watching Nick Jr., I caught my youngest (at the time 16-17 months) dancing to their songs, smiling, laughing and pointing to the TV whenever they came on.  My daughter is now 20 months, still loves the show and is singing the songs!The Fresh Beat Band display very fun, energetic performances and while it seems their target audience might be between the age ranges of 5 - 10, younger children (and some adults ... like myself!) will enjoy the grown up sound of their music (cross between pop and hip-hop) and the positive messages they promote.This is a real band (not unlike similar/rival Disney ones) that actually tour the country!",Positive
"Although I've always liked Timmothy Hutton's acting abilities, I'd have to say in this series, his character is flat.  In the whole first season, it seems like the actors aren't really that interested in playing their parts to the full extent of their talents.  As a drunk, Tim Hutton seems to drag the show down because he is the leader of the group and impacts all the characters, so perhaps he is playing his role perfectly?!?Maybe next season, the characters will show more life.  Although I can't recommend that you spend your money on ""Leverage,"" I recommend renting it first (or watching some of it on the Amazon Movie program if it is available), and then deciding if you'd like to buy Season 2.",Negative
Amazing show definitely an absolute most own. Norman and his mom are totally creepy. This show really surprises great quality,Positive
One of the few shows we found we waited for each week. We don't watch a lot of tv but my husband and I organized our schedules around both being home and awake to see this. I really like the Aidan Quinn  and the cops.,Positive
"This is a great, family friendly, show that helps kids with shapes and counting. It's fun entertainment and the kids love it.",Positive
"When I first watched this I was multitasking and my first impression was not the most positive. I have never watched Glee basically because I just was never curious about it. Since subscribing to Amazon Prime I have watched more TV and decided I was going to check out these shows they are starting up. So on with my impression.... I dismissed this show originally, maybe because the singing was new to me, and thought I might give it 3 stars at best. But after watching it a 2nd time I actually liked it. Bebe Neuwirth is a good choice for her character and she is not one to ""Fudge"" with! It is basically about four young people getting their start in the working world in some place that would compare to one of the major internet sites and they are supposed to find the cream of the crop story potentials. And they sing. Anyway, I liked the four characters and think they work well together... My impression is the show has good potential.",Positive
"NO way no more. how did it make it to a second season. never again. Dumb, just plain dumb. Paint drying would create more drama.",Negative
great had a lot of parts that the two show did not have due to timing. doctor who is the best,Positive
"The film deals with the age old conflict of control of natural resources. In this case an international company called Clear-Bec runs water filtration systems. It makes deals with governments to take over the waterways used by the poor indigenous population, then turn around and sell them what has been free. Old progressives are familiar with this type of thing from Susan George's ""How the Other Half Dies"" (1976).In this particular case, the water in an Ecuadorian village becomes polluted with sewage and leads to a typhus epidemic which wipes out a village. Part of the damage control was to have the military ensure there were no witnesses. The incident is brought to the attention of Morgan Swinton (Deborah Kara Unger) part owner of the evil corporation. She has a conscience and wants to get to the bottom of the incident against the wishes of her brother and the rest of the company.She hires radio talk show host and former CIA agent Jack Begosian (Andy Garcia) who used to work on the other side of these types of issues. For him it is a chance for redemption and to bury those demons. His goal is to bring back the only witness, an activist who has the secret files of what happened, Francisco Francis (Forest Whitaker).The film is about a fictional corporation doing things that are not beyond the realm of reason, until they bring the fight home, then I had to scratch my head. Personally I would have liked to seen a dramatization of a certain soft drink company who we all know and love and their involvement with the assassination of union leaders in Columbia.Andy Garcia and Forest Whitaker are typically animated characters in stories. In this movie they are rather subdued and defined more by their philosophical ramblings than actions. The plot was fairly simple without any real twist. The final shoot out I found grossly unbelievable. I never got to experience the pain of the affected people, nor did I develop any type connection with the main character whose past, which was fundamental to understanding him, was not fully explained. Not as good as Sean Connery in the Amazon Rain Forest.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Killing, some blood not overly graphic.",Negative
"This show has a really good premise and recognizable characters. Even in the very rough form kids still liked it. I would like to see a bit of exposition on who the characters are, how they found Oz, etc. Either way the kids lived it, and they want to see more.",Positive

"For three seasons, ""Fringe"" was a sci-fi masterpiece worthy of any other other ever created in that genre.  Then, the network (in this case FOX) decided to cast it off to the ""fringes"" (pun intended) of their schedule, burying it on Friday nights and make the show creators sweat out renewal, severely affecting plot cohesiveness.  So, by the time this final truncated season got the O.K., it was clear that the show would never truly recapture the magic of earlier installments.  That being said, the show producers still managed to create a workable ending to such a high-concept show.  It just wasn't in the jaw-dropping format of the past.For a basic plot summary of the Fifth Season, this campaign sees the show shift into the future, where Peter (Joshua Jackson), Olivia (Anna Torv), and Walter (John Noble) are pulled out of yellow amber by none other than Peter & Olivia's daughter, Etta (Georgina Haig).  They discover a world in havoc and terror, caused by an Observer takeover.  However, Walter has a plan to set things right, requiring a number of different ""ingredients"" (compromising the bulk of the season's episodes) and help from old friends Astrid (Jasika Nicole), Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), and Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick).The obvious problem with this season is that because of FOX's tampering, the show oozed away all its most creative juices in a rollercoaster season four.  Without knowing whether or not a final renewal was imminent, the writers were practically held hostage, story-arc wise.  So, by the time word finally came down that a 13-episode send-off was a go, things had to be severely simplified.  Thus, a show that once dealt with some hefty, mind-bending topics was reduced to ""rebels vs Observers"" in terms of the main plotline.  In essence, it failed to distinguish itself from other general sci-fi fare currently on the airwaves.Yet, despite that glaring weakness, the Fifth Season still holds some meaning in the Fringe cannon for one main reason: the characters.  When all the lofty storytelling and mind-bending plots fall away, the strong characters that comprise this show still stand strong.  You'll keep watching because you want to see how they all end up.Simply put, the Fifth Season of ""Fringe"" is clearly in a different class (unfortunately a lower class) than the first three or maybe even four seasons of the show.  It is still interesting to watch because, at least for sci-fi ""big idea"" show fans right now, the pickings are extremely slim.  It just isn't the ""glory days"" of old.",Negative
"Absolutely one of, if not the most funny new shows I've seen. You won't be disappointed. These guys are brilliant!!",Positive
If you like offbeat British humor this is a good program for you.  This program is believeable and down to earth.,Positive
"I always liked Jen and Bill. She's so upbeat and he's so funny. And they seem like a rock-solid couple who don't take the good things they've earned in life lightly. It was fun watching them become a couple, marry, and build their dream home. Unfortunately, we've also seen them struggle with infertility, but now they have welcomed a son--and soon a daughter--into the family. Watching the couple interact with their adorable child, Will, adopted from China, is heartwarming. They've jumped straight into the terrible twos, which is not an easy age even for parents who've known their babies since birth, but Bill and Jen are dealing with their little one the way they deal with most challenges: with a positive attitude and a great sense of humor. This couple wanted to be parents so badly and they are really appreciating the beautiful child they now have.I can't say enough good stuff about Bill and Jen. They've remained in their jobs and don't seem to have let notoriety go to their heads, unlike plenty of other reality TV families.It's a terrific show and I can't wait to meet the soon-to-be fourth member, daughter Zoe.",Positive
"Feels like Terra Nova in many ways to be honest.  Though that show in my opinion was promising, I feel it was cancelled before it's time.The 100 starts off going from 0 to 60 pretty quick, and it has not stopped there. I will not give away any spoilers, but if the show continues to progress, I feel it will do well.",Positive
like it very much - better than original series although I liked it also.Hope it returns next year also.,Positive
Laurence Fox is a great actor in any show.  Would watch him in all British television. He and Devin Whately make a great team.,Positive

"Season Nine wrapped up one of my favorite shows of all time in a fashion that I can only describe as &#34;perfect&#34;. It retained the &#34;laugh out loud&#34; moments that I've grown so used to over the past nine years (Dwight as &#34;Belschneckel for Christmas was one favorite, as well as Andy's sea voyage), as well as wrapping up all the plot lines that had been dangling out there. Last but not least, a few classic characters return briefly to help send the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin off with a bang. Long time fans will not be disappointed!",Positive
just can't get enough of this series.  Love western themes. This Longmire isdone so so well!!,Positive
This family is the only reality show family worth watching. It isn't a zoo with ridiculous made up problems. It is real life with real challenges and they handle everything with love and strength.,Positive
"First off let's get something straight right out of the gate--I like and will watch anything Eric McCormack is in, no matter what the material is. The rest of the cast is exceptional for this show as well although I admit at first I rolled my eyes a bit at Rachel Leigh Cook being cast as an FBI agent since my initial impression was that she's just a little too young and fresh-faced to be taken seriously in that role. However, she does such a good job of bringing her character to life that I soon set aside my skepticism and now can't imagine how anyone else could do the role.The plotline of the show is your traditional fish out of water protagonist helps law enforcement catch bad guys in a non-traditional manner. This is a very standard story line that has been done well in shows ranging from Medium to Monk, so in that regard there aren't any real surprises. We all know the protagonist will see things fully-trained law enforcement can't and through a combination of luck, special talents and even the occasional deus ex machina (plot device where a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved through the intervention of some new event, character, ability, or object). However, this show takes a new original and yes fresh take on the template so to speak. To that end the plot of the TV show can be summed up as this: Chicago Professor Dr. Daniel Pierce (Eric McCormack) is a brilliant neuroscientist who has published four books and now teaches the subject at a local university. A former student of his, FBI Special Agent Kate Moretti, shows up one day telling Dr. Pierce that she's been reassigned to Chicago from D.C. after the higher ups there got annoyed that she tended to not necessarily follow orders. Anyways it turns out Dr. Pierce has acted as a consultant for law enforcement before and Kate enlists her former teacher's help in solving some of the more puzzling cases that she encounters. There is a catch to all of this however, Dr. Pierce is a labeled paranoid schizophrenic who manages his condition primarily with the help of his Boy Friday Teaching Assistant Max Lewicki and talks with his best friend and former love interest Natalie Vincent.Dr. Pierce is definitely a bit paranoid, highly suspicious of all things government and/or modern-living based including microwave meals, full body scans and any political figure including the ones he voted for as ""the lesser of two evils"". We learn that Dr. Pierce had a breakdown when he was still a college student, got diagnosed and became a neuroscientist thanks largely to his fascination with and desire to understand what was happening to him. A manifestation of his illness is that he sees people who aren't there--manifestations and/or hallucinations brought on as his mind grapples with a variety of mysteries and issues that he is struggling to help Agent Moretti resolve. This is the really fun part of this series since neither we or Dr. Pierce always know who is real and who isn't although after you've watched a few episodes you can sort of guess who is a hallucination, especially when it's a historical figure like Joan of Arc or JFK. Nonetheless watching Eric McCormack play someone who knows he's seriously flawed, who himself isn't always sure of what's real or not,  brings a surprisingly touching performance to those in our society who find themselves on the outskirts of ""normal"" society often shunned and feared even when they have done nothing wrong.Dr. Pierce isn't a particularly brave man either, put him in a room where a surprise party is being held and he freezes like a deer caught in headlights and begins franticly searching for a way out of the room. He often clutches a satchel to his chest when he's feeling especially insecure and when things get too overwhelming he retreats to playing classical music on an old casette player and headphones while he air conducts the music to soothe himself and block out noise or situations. He knows he's weird, we know he's weird, the world knows he's weird, but he manages. And truthfully he'd be utterly useless in his work with the FBI or as a teacher except for one thing--when a puzzle is placed before him or he can teach someone something the man simply comes to life. And does so in a way that is so real it makes me wonder who Eric McCormack has hung out with to get his role right. We all know that one person who's an oddball or just a bit mentally not there, but if you put the thing they love most in front of them they change so quickly that you wonder if it's even the same person.The show also shows us something about those who society deems mentally ill--that no matter how far off the grid someone may have appeared to fall they can still be a useful citizen and they are our fellow man. Many of the characters in the show are also, like Dr. Pierce, deemed mentally ill or flawed in some way. Add to that the constant commentary and plots involving today's latest scandals and human rights issues and you have a very compelling TV show for those who like their entertainment to be a bit more intelligent than average and who love their heroes to be flawed, real human beings who still choose to do the right thing even when they know it's not really good for their life or state of mental health.My only complaint with the show, and why I took one star off, is that I don't feel it realistically shows the truth about the mental health industry or the people who work in it as a whole. Although Dr. Pierce occasionally makes a snide remark about primitive drugs or people being committed and/or drugged the show tends to portray mental health workers, psychiatrists and hospitals as benevolent places and people who all really do care about those needing their services. That's a nice fantasy that I happen to know from bitter experience with family and friends just isn't true. In the real world those who are unlucky enough to find themselves labeled mentally ill are sadly all too often exploited and treated the worst by the very people who are supposed to be helping them. When Dr. Pierce's psychiatrist in the hospital tells him she can't treat him as a patient, but offers to be his friend as a replacement for an imaginary one I rolled my eyes and shook my head. That just never would happen except for maybe an equally outcast therapist or psychiatrist. And again, I know from real-world experience that they are often just as ostracized and badly treated by their colleages and generally they tend to gravitate towards private practices rather than large hospitals where they are often fired or laid off at the first chance their bosses get.Is the series worth watching? Just for Eric McCormack's performance and the originality of the series I would say yes. I'll see what Season 2 brings though before I decide that mabye I just can't keep suspending disbelief over the portrayal of a mental health industry as being far more benevelont and helpful than it really is. And that would be a shame, becaause everything else about this series hits a perfect note with me outside of that.",Positive
"If you are on the hunt for a new thrilling and suspenceful horror flick, then IFC Midnight's latest release, Rites Of Spring, is the one for you. Written and directed by Padraig Reynolds, Rites Of Spring brings the thriller and horror genres together in perfect harmony. This film delivers on all cylinders with an exciting story line, a believable cast and tons-o-gore.While two stories are being intercut during this film, one being more of a thriller and the other a straight-up horror piece, Rites Of Spring delivers a perfect marrige between the two. With a creepy old farmer preying on young women in one, and a kidnapping that doesn't go as planned in the parallel tale, a great deal of mystery plays out in both.The cast found within this film are all lesser known/unknown actors who obviously have a passion for film. Anessa Ramsey delivers a spine-tingling performance as the character Rachel and after this film, she is destined to be called upon for many more horror roles in the future. From her line delivery to her trembling hands, Ramsey's screen presence is remarkable to say the least.As the film progresses, the blood begins to spill more and more. There are a few effects, that looked to be done with After Effects, that can be done without, but overall the look and realism of the gore is well above average. A round of applause must be give to the practical effects crew as well as the members of this production who came up with the look of the mysterious monster-like killer. This very scary and realistc looking crazy killer dons old rags and maggots as he brutely murders his victims.Rites Of Spring was a surprisingly fun and blood filled ride from begining to end.",Positive
"The crew is still going strong, although I think they have started to mellow some with this season. I think the provoking is not so strong and maybe they have decided that a more scientific approach is better. Looking forward to another great season.Always highly recommended for their investigative skills of the paranormal.",Positive
This is perhaps the worst Batman cartoon of all time.  Whoever put this on TV should be beaten with a sock full of pennies.,Negative

"Not as interesting as watching Kyra Sedgewick and figuring out what is wrong with her mouth, but the rest of the characters are still entertaining. Plus, who knew she was married to Kevin Bacon?",Positive
Season for went out with a bang and season five came back with a bang after 12 years off the air futurama is back and hopefully to stay for a long time. People demanded the show back and for good reason. Its awesome. if the simpsons can run for 20 season so can this. this show is awesome. I hope to see more,Positive
"Well, if you are looking for a different type of Western series, this is it.  The basic premise is different as well as the really authentic clothing and styles.  I'm glad I didn't live back then; times were really tough and life was a major struggle. I also like Anson Mount in the lead role.  He looks and acts the part perfectly.  Season 2 continues on with Cullen Bohannon and his goal to bring all of the people that murdered his wife and son to justice (HIS justice).  A very enjoyable series with a lot of twists and turns.",Positive
"Although some of the dialogue and characters were a little dumbed down, this was an excellent show. Kept me hook with interesting actions. Dialogue could be a little better but the ending was superb and I'd certainly watch the rest of the series. As someone born on March 7, I was genuinely afraid. I may be next! Good show.",Positive
"This plot has been done before with variations, but it was pretty good. Caution, there are way too many 'F' bombs in the dialog that serve no purpose.",Positive
"This series is a unique way of presenting a documentary film.  The setting was historical, beautiful and imposing; imposing because it demanded the current residents forget which century they live in and live by the standards of the past.  All involved in the making of this series agreed that they would and could do this for three months.  Some could do that very convincingly.  Others couldn&#8217;t survive a week at the attempt to adapt.  Therefore, as a modern-day audience, one had to make a decision to become completely absorbed in this project, or turn in off and fail the challenge of being thankful for the time frame of our existence and acknowledge that much of today was built on the sacrifices of previous generations and times.  I found the series challenging, informative, educational, and somewhat emotional.  Bob&#8217;s Girl",Positive
I have been a fan since the first episode. Jeffrey Donovan is a awesome actor . Plus we always looks hot in his suites. I also really like the actor that plays Sam. He is so funny and cute also. If you like action packed shows you gotta see burn notice. There's never a dull moment.,Positive
"'The Bridge' is a series on the FX network that is a must see. It is not the usual 'whodunit' but a complex mystery/police procedural. It is not without blood and gore and extreme violence, but the characters and the environment make this series unforgettable.On the highway connecting the Texas town of El Paso and Mexico&#8217;s Juarez, a body is found, and in the process the body is found to be bisected. The top half and the bottom half don't match, what H*ll is this? The police from both countries are called to the scene, and because the upper half of the body is in El Paso and the bottom part in Juarez, both detectives find themselves workng together. at the beginning, neither wants the other, but as time moves on a respectful working arrangement is worked out. The female detective, Sonya Cross played by Diana Kruger, is eager to pursue the case wherever it might lead. The more reluctant detective, Marco Ruiz, played by Bichir knows that on his side of the fence, asking the wrong questions can quickly get you disappeared. Det. Ruiz it appears, tries to do the right thing, but he is working with such a corrupt police force, with so much violence and crime, that overlooking the obstacles is the only way to live. Det. Cross is a young woman with no social skills, it seems she has Aspergers and never had the appropriate treatment. In the first episode she apologizes to a man for not showing enough empathy. She understands her behavior is aberrant at times, but at others, she is blind to the affect of her behavior. It is fascinating watching her, and I like her character a lot.Into the mix we have a Mexican widow, who finds that her husband has been helping Mexican immigrants into the country illegally. The colleagues and teams of both detectives are introduced. Det Ruiz's family plays a big part of his life, and we meet them often at dinner time. A newspaper is involved. One of the journalists is a druggie, but the killer of the woman on the bridge and others, phones him with information. All of this is an introduction to the series, the characters we will meet and the beautiful but often seamy sides of both countries.The stories these characters tell are outrageous and chilling. The two detectives strive to find the answers. This is a series well worth your time.Recommended. prisrob 08-09-13",Positive
I love the Stargate Universe series. The actors are so perfect for their parts and it is a joy to watch this science fiction action. I higly recommend it to all scifi fans.,Positive
"Excellent writing, acting, and videography. Believable, flawed characters. Twists and turns, never obvious. Vera and her team are realistic, wonderful and funny.",Positive
"This is a dark tale to be sure, but I couldn&#8217;t stop watching.  Season 2 builds on the first season with further character development.  The Brits have a gift for plot and storytelling.  DI Chandler is such a complex individual with a sense of right and wrong, loyalty, and OCD as his constant companion.Miles is wonderful because he is a polar opposite of Chandler and throws him a lifeline when necessary.  Ed&#8230;Oh well, even as he is ignored by everyone, he is constantly looking for similarities from previous crimes.  He is almost like a code breaker of human behavior.  The other characters float, but these three Chandler, Miles and Ed seem to move the story along.If you are into a lot of flash/bang type of police procedurals this is not for you.  I have only recently become a fan of English TV series, but they have me hooked.  Yep, they are slower paced than US TV of the same genre, but I am hooked on them.",Positive
"Interesting enough to keep me watching. It did not go the way I would have chosen, but I am not the writer.  A reasonably well acted series.  Darryl and Merle were good while they lasted. Rick was loosing me, and the damn Governor is still alive. I really wanted Michone to take his head.  Now they have taken in Woodbury refugees and they still don't have much in the way of groceries.  They'll have to range wider for the scrounging and who knows where that will lead?",Positive

"Here's the deal:  I love Falling Skies.  Season 1 was great and Season 2 took an interesting turn, but I really enjoyed it.  In fact, I kept telling my friends who're into sci-fi like me to watch this series ASAP.  But then my fervor for FS decreased once Season 3 came and finished.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few great moments in this season, but I have to say it's overall disappointing.  What direction are they taking this series to?  Are the Volm really good or not?  Are they freedom fighters?  Or imperialists?  At this point, I've vested too much time (and heart) to stop watching, so I'll be back for S4 next year and will hope that they don't mess up this good show.",Negative
"The Poirot adventures with David Suchet--which began nearly a quarter century ago and just recently concluded--are some of the best classic British mysteries on television. That they were saddled for years with crappy DVD transfers was a shame. But now you can enjoy pristine Blu Rays of the original Super 16 footage; they look fantastic. If you watch your Poirots as much as my wife and I do, you owe it to yourself to pick up the Blu Rays. It's well worth buying the shows a second time.",Positive

"While I certainly wouldn't claim that the first season represented the pinnacle of acting and dialog, season 2 has somehow managed to find a way through the bottom of that barrel and plunged to new depths of poor production and ludicrous logic. It's probably no spoiler than season 1 ended with Barbie (yes, that's a guy's real name in this show) with a noose around his neck on the gallows - this is resolved in the first episode in the most uninspired, incredulous, eye-rolling and ultimately lame way in seconds before they drop him to certain death. And that's the best thing that happens.Who might be the screenwriter for this first episode? Was it a second-grader finishing a corrective English assignment or the overrated ""master of horror"" himself Stephen King? Seriously, I'm surprised he didn't introduce an author with writer's block as a lead character. This episode brings in all the worst and most repetitive tropes of King's recycled writing from the cringe-inducing dialog to total disregard for character, logic and story. It's like laziest episode of The Outer Limits had an affair with a canceled daytime soap opera. It's so bad as to be completely unwatchable.Though it limped through a first season as its own concept, this show has now officially become Lost. By which I mean the TV show, although it has actually become lost as well. Things that happen for no reason are blamed on the island, I mean dome, which exists purely to act as a sandbox around a bunch of overwrought D-list actors (if only I bottle up their energetic overacting and sell it). Plot-wise, they can throw anything into the mix from resurrection the dead (done that) to changing physics (done that, too) and getting all pseudo-intellectual (please don't do that). It's horrible. And to think Dean Norris was so good in Breaking Bad. So when's the next season of The Americans coming on?",Negative
"""There's been an outbreak, a global pandemic that started in South America...from those infected there are no survivors. It's fatal and it's spreading rapidly."" Kate (Newton) and Martin (Murphy) are in marital trouble. After their first child is stillborn they find a house on a secluded island to stay in and try to work things out. Things are going OK until a stranger shows up on the island. This is a movie that is made by the ending. The entire movie is pretty slow moving and boring in some parts with only three characters in a house for most of the movie. If you stick with it though you won't be disappointed. The ending makes you re-think everything that was said in the movie and makes it better then it could have been. Overall, a bad movie with a good ending. I give it a C+.",Negative
"To the extent it stays true to the memoir on which it is based and titled, the story line might be acceptable. Otherwise, it seems to have the trajectory to be trite and predictable. Sex and music deftly handled can worked. If simply formulaic, I would pass.",Negative
"Some movies need to be seen even if they aren't necessarily great movies. ""Sky Captain and the Land of Tomorrow"" would be one of those titles. Is it a great movie? No. But it's a great achievement. Never was there a movie before that looked or felt like it. The visuals are stunning and it somehow manages to achieve a look that is both futuristic and retro 40s at the same time. ""Metropia"" is also such a movie.This is an animated movie....kind of. I've not read up on the technique, but it looks as though there is live action melded in with animation. The look itself is intriguing. Add to that the fact that the characters have oversized heads and it crosses over into creepy. It takes place in a dystopian future and the production design depicting the various indoor and outdoor scenery also has a very disquieting look.Similar to ""Brazil"" and ""Metropolis"" the viewer is faced with a repressive society where the population is being controlled and monitored. Now even the shampoo is working its way into our minds to help the process. The main character, Roger, hears voices that he's beginning to suspect are not the result of mental instability. When he hooks up with ""The Shampoo Girl"" he becomes involved in a plot to take the whole rotten mess down.The plot is OK. Aside from a couple of twists, there is nothing particularly clever in the way things unwind. It is good enough though to hold the viewer's interest. What really works are the visuals. This is simply mesmerising. I've never seen anything even nearly like it. It also profits by the use of good voices. Vince Gallo, Juliette Lewis, Udu Kier et al help move things forward. The sound design is also good. It helps add to the oppressiveness of it all.If you're into the weird and wonderful in films. If you're wanting to see the possibilities in film making, then this is a must see. If you're waiting for the next ""American Pie"" installment, don't bother.",Negative
It's an okay show. Acting is about par with being a CBS drama. Story line is great but the story has more potential than the show delivers.,Negative
I have not finished watching this documentary but have seen enough to want to complete the series.  There is an historian that stated the celts never arrived in Britain or Ireland.  It is hard to know where he was going with this since he did not present any facts to prove his hypothesis.  Back to the drawing board fella!,Positive
"OK getting past the idea there are zombies wandering around all over the place. Who knows perhaps there are zombies, since I have been in the store and I am sure most people pushing a carts are zombies.So these non-zombie folks have the run of the country and make a living without the zombies making lunch out of them. They wander around looking for supplies and dodging gangs of criminals. This is pretty entertaining for a while. Then you start asking yourself&#8230;what is wrong with these folks.  If I was faced with this situation I would clean up the zombie problem in the morning and have a garden planted in the afternoon.I sure would not be living in a prison and life would be good where I would bathe regularly and change my clothes often.All in all a fun program. I don&#8217;t believe in zombies but just in case I bought a 12 gauge Simi auto. What happens to zombies in the snow?",Positive
"I like the show, but it moves too slowly.  There are like 3 episodes and they call it a season. Then I have to wait a year to find out what's next. Pretty frustrating. I will wait until the entire series is over and then watch them all in the same day. Not sure what the trouble is, but there should 8 - 9 episodes a year.  Also the plot is drifting. Fighting and acting scenes very good.",Negative
I loved the angle of where history meets crime and being able to learn from previous cases to solve what is currently happening!,Positive
"One of the best horror films made during that era. Truly one to watch late at night alone, in the dark!",Positive
Its all good! like the main character and all the supporting actors for this. The situations are believable and continue to fascinate me. Every now and then they put some badly needed humor in to lighten up what in some cases is a very dark story line. So far I have through to the 3rd season and can't wait for Amazon to make the fourth and fifth season free as well. Can't seem to find them anywhere else so far...dammit!,Positive

"I enjoy listening to Sherlock's reasoning for every aspect of his life. The pairing of these characters, though completely at odds with the original, passes the test with believability. Enjoy this series very much.",Positive
"I could hardly believe the episode was over the time went so fast. Your attention NEVER wanders. More great zombie battles and again kudos to whomever is doing their makeup and costume.  The workmanship and attention to detail is incredible. This is mirrored by the rest of the show which also seamlessly creates the prison and the Guv's seemingly idyllic town. Lots of action, lots of death...keep em coming!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!There are more deaths of key characters and this fits with the arc of the comics.  The only two characters who the comics' creator seems bent on preserving are Rick and Carl.  Everyone else is fair game.  So we lost more characters this time with the big one being Rick's wife. In the comics, Rick's wife is safely delivered of the baby but they are both killed during a huge fight at the prison.  In the tv version the baby lives while the wife dies during delivery. So the tv version has decided to add the baby as a character, just like it added Darryl as a character.Everything happening with the Guv is just like it unfolds in the comics and his pathology is given to us in bits and pieces. Darryl's brother being his sidekick is solely in the tv version because he doesn't exist in the comics.  So far, I think these additions work pretty well.Things will kick up with Michonne as she is onto the Guv while Andrea is increasingly beguiled by him. Michonne vs the Guv should be key as it is key in the comics. If you have loved this so far, that should really be the centerpiece of the whole season, those two locked in combat. You will love it.",Positive
"This is definitely an awesome show, as good, if not better than expected.  I especially enjoyed the first episode.  Boo yeah.",Positive
"I couldn't help but think that the writers of ""Those Who Can't"" were trying too hard. It lacks Original ideas. It's been done. The three guys act similar to the three men on ABCs cancelled show ""Man Up"". In addition, the character such as Loren Payton (Adam Cayton-Holland) feel like he could be placed straight into an episode of Always Sunny In Philadelphia.The jokes are also outdated. I'm 21 and have heard these jokes (well similar) numerous times.But for what it is...the show isn't that bad. It is watchable but lacks in a lot of departments.3/5 starsIt is only the first episode so I still have high hopes for the show. Time will tell.",Negative

"That would be a better title for this doc.!  The tide of war, in all reality and truth turned against Germany when Hitler began to think he knew more than his Generals. It started in 39 when he failed to Invade England and waited on the worthless Goeing to win the Air War.  His hesitancy lost it again in Russia when he turned his Panzer Generals away from their original objectives.  Hitler was a megalomaniac whose fears were fueled by his use of drugs and his diseased brain to map out strategies that were doomed to fail.  Good thing for the Allies it did fail or we would all be speaking German though I wouldn't have because of my Father whose career in military intelligence would have doomed all of us in our family to extinction!",Positive

"If I could use one adjective to describe the Bachelor despite the numerous picks that cross my mind; *cheesy* & *ridiculous* being some, the particular word I do feel strongly about is *desperate*.Desperate for fame, recognition, attention, and obviously getting a man into their lives who can buy them expensive objects they can droll on for eternity. The show producers are desperate for ratings.Haven't anyone noticed that almost all the hand picked Bachelors are slim, youthful, successful, above average in financial well fare and model like looking? and that all the contestants are also the same?I have yet to find one season that is starring an obese or overweight bachelor that does not have a six pack but is actually sweet and gentle Or I have yet to see one season where the contestants don't all look like Kate Moss in her best years and don't even get me started on how 97% of them are ethnically white. *Gasp* did I just call the Bachelor racist?Their Hollywood mentality aside, the notion of the show is laughable and pathetic. Finding the love of your life on a prime time reality series is like finding a nutritional value in processed junk food. Why do these people need to go on TV to marry someone? And even if they ended up marrying it would be for all the wrong reasons. These people cannot assist their qualities as spouses if the only time to get to see and know each other is to make a show in front of the camera.This show could be scripted and I would be happier if it was. the relief of knowing there aren't any stupid people out there. However, sadly it doesn't look like it and there are such people.",Negative
Loved it from the first episode and could not wait for the DVD to be released so I could watch the episodes over and over.  It is just that good.  I am hanging out for more as the first Season only had thirteen episodes.  I believe it has now been definitely picked up and therefore can look forward to many more.  Do yourself a favour and watch it you will not be disappointed.,Positive

"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MSDecoded is the perfect show to me -- part mystery, part adventure, a little fun and all conspiracy. As I get older I see conspiracy in just about everything and it makes me feel good to know I'm not alone.Led by Brad Meltzer, author and investigator -- Scott Rolle, U.S. Army Reserves Major and trial attorney; Christine McKinley, mechanical engineer and writer and Buddy Levy,  English professor and journalist are in search of the truth.Their first adventure in season 2 takes them to the Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. According to our explorers no one has been in the vault and seen the gold since 1974. They know if the gold is no longer there, it could devastate the nation's economy.Some of my favorite episodes include:Vatican --  They investigate rumors that the Vatican could have been involved in the death of Pope John Paul I, who was only on the job 33 days before he was found dead of mysterious causes. They also expose possible ties to the Freemasons and the Mafia.Mafia: Alive? -- Brad's team start with Al Capone and search to the present to see if the Mafia is really gone, or just taken on a different image. It appears they've become high-tech criminals, stealing identities and money off the internet. I can buy that.2012: It Has Begun -- This is pretty far-fetched to me. Some believe Dec. 21, 2012 will be the end of the world, based on  ancient Mayan legends. They lose me when they mix the texts of King James Bible.

"I don't watch much reality TV (honest), but I really love this show. Not in a love-love sort of a way, but more in a love-to-hate sort of way.

I'm not proud of this, but there you go.",Positive
"A very large bank has the unlikely event of being robbed by two different gangs at the same time. One group is dressed as a swat team while a second gang appears to have been on ""Deliverance."" Patrick Dempsey stars as Tripp, a customer who is fascinated by bank teller Katlin (Ashley Judd) and attempts to keep her out of harm's way. Katlin is supposed to get married in 2 days to a rich man.After shots are fired, Tripp (who is off his medication) acts as a mediator between the two gangs to work out a compromise. There are things about this robbery that don't add up in Tripp's mind and he wants to know why. Tripp has a mental condition which aids him to figure things out. He plays ""Clue"" as things turn into ""10 Little Indians."" The robbers are a good quirky bunch as are the hostages. Excellent use of characters. Funny. Fast paced.

"This film raises serious questions, such as should I give my copy away or throw it out? Randy (Patton Oswalt) is determined to take a group of boys on a scouting trip. He persuades the kids with a corny scout video to the dismay of everyone and absconds with the kids to the woods. The film had potential, but didn't know which way to go. The frequency of crude humor prevented it from being a kid's film. The crude juvenile humor prevented it from becoming a good adult film. It should have appeal to an adolescent crowd, one too young for the rating.The characters are poorly developed. Leonard, whose mother coddles him, is not utilized. Kent's attraction for the older women could have been made more for an adult audience, as long as the film is going that way. What was with the naked girl on the motorcycle? The opening scene was idiotic as scout masters take on the responsibility of informing a child his father has died.Are there funny scenes? Yes. In spite of all the crudeness, there were scenes which made me laugh, but too few to put up with a poorly written production. At one point I thought they were going to mimic ""Lord of the Flies,"" but that fell flat. I think a LOTF spoof would have worked better i.e. make Leonard a fat kid they call ""Piggy"" etc.Watch at you own risk.Parental Guide: Frequent F-bombs in front of children.

"I love everything about Falling Skies: the characters, the plot, the aliens, the surprises. I love it all. The main characters (Tom, Pope, Ben, Hal, Lourdes, Anne, Matt, Maggie, Anthony) bring me back to watch every episode of this show. I can't wait to see what is in store for the next season.",Positive
"I choose this rating because this is one of my favorite shows. I have been a fan since Season 1. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes action, adventure, and a good mystery every now and then. The plot line is really good and the cast is awesome. I have Seasons 1 & 2 of Person of Interest on DVD and am definitely hooked.",Positive
One of the best ending for any show I have followed over the years. I loved the use of lasers during the last show.,Positive
"What a captivating series of Charles Dickens'book LITTLE DORRIT.  I read a biography on Dickens by an actor-author who claims if writing was Dickens' wife, the theater was Dickens' mistress.  Dickens used to act out many of his books and characters the biography noted.  Dickens' true love was the stage, or theater.  He would go around the country doing readings of his books and act out the characters.  Perhaps that's why his books translate so well to film and the stage.  I actually prefer to watch them, than read his stories.  Especially if they equal the quality of this production.Every scene is exquisite.  The sets, the lighting, the camera angles, the props make early 19th century London come alive.  You want to freeze the frames and study the scene.  The screenplay was written by Andrew Davies who wrote HOUSE OF CARDS and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, the Colin Firth version (1995).  He's working on Tolstoy's WAR AND PEACE to be aired on BBC in 2015.But back to LITTLE DORRIT, the acting matches the production's quality.  Speaking of Mr. Darcy, Matthew Macfayden is honorable and virtuous as Arthur Clennam who returns home to find a maid with a mystery in his mother's home.  The maid, Claire Foy, is a dutiful daughter and cares for her father stuck in debtor's prison.  Of course, Dickens wouldn't be Dickens without eccentric and oddball characters who snort and cackle and which are played to the hilt here.  It appears everyone is having a good time playing an oddity.  There's a bundle of characters and many subplots.It is an entertaining escape and may make you glad you live in 2014 instead of 1814.  This is the kind of series you can watch more than once as the detail is brilliant.  Love that it is free with Amazon Prime.  It pays for the subscription.",Positive
This show has the perfect amount of fun and drama. The characters all have good chemistry. I think it has an appeal for several types of viewers. Great characters. Excellent female leads.,Positive
"The action heats up in the third season and Annie is tougher. So the show is more complex, less like a soap and much more entertaining.",Positive
"Fast. Witty. Suits is on a roll. All the New York kind of attack now and ask questions later that gets people in trouble all the time. Not my style of living, but curious to watch.",Positive
I only looked at this program to find out what all the hype was about.  This program is not for me personally.  It's good to have choices of what you can look at; but this program will never be tuned in on my television again.  Different strokes for different folks.,Negative
The girls are good looking and the guys are nice also.  I would like to see Aaron with the gal from chicago fire.  Love my cop shows.  Like where alot of the actors and actresses off Chicago Fire guest star on this show.  Hope it becomes a big hit.,Positive
This is a great series. I am so glad I found it. It is now one of my favorite television shows.,Positive
Not your MJFox vehicle.  This is a very fun teen show the first season.  Effects are way better than expected.  Well done MTV.Shocking that I enjoyed it as much as i did.  Little teen angsty at times but hey...MTVWell done series.,Positive
"This is another show that breaks from the norm and sets a new standard for a show that is different in so many ways.  Season 2 lives up to the standards set by Season 1.  The bad guys in this show is balanced nicely with the good guys.  Even the main character-Regina, trying to change for her step-son.  Highly recommended show.",Positive
The stories are totally absorbing.  The application of the science offered by the Lightman Group seems endless so the stories are never duplicated and ALWAYS exciting.  Each episode leaves you wanting more.  The main characters are  very interesting and their stories continue to unfold in each episode making the series even more interesting.  Season 2  is great.  Check it out!,Positive
"If you know Spanish (Spain) humor, then you know what to expect. Its very irreverent. The story revolves around our unlikely protags, who are a group of men with resentments against the opposite sex, among other things, of course. They soon find themselves in the lair of a matriarchal (large) cult of witches  The production values are strong. I imagine this film had a strong budget to work with. The visuals are striking and rich, giving me the feeling of a graphic novel brought to life. Not that it is anime, just a feeling I had, from watching the colorful, attention grabbing, polished visuals, ranging from the various costumed people that appear at the very beginning to the CGI endowed climax.The film explodes from the beginning, with a fast paced, action filled, armed robbery. There are no lulls, no gradual build ups, no slow pacing. Its a fast rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. There's a pre-pubertal kid in it, but the film is not PG13ified by his inclusion. The content is largely mature themed, mainly in terms of the dialogue.  The film is unrated but it could've been R, at least by my standards.There's a not subtle social commentary running through it, which is definitely culturally relevant in Spain. I wouldn't be surprised if American men would be able to identify with the feelings our protags express. I don't want to spoil anything, as its best to let the film surprise you and it should. Its definitely not a typical film experience. Its larger than life, in more than one way. More spectacle than theater.I do have to disagree with the other reviewer who compared it to classic Spanish horror. To me, it was as far removed from Amando de Ossorio's Blind Dead movies as you could get (and I love, love, love those). And Paul Naschy? He never crossed my mind when I was watching this. Its not in the style of Eurohorror. Its actually not what I consider horror to be at all. Lovers of any horror movie may not like this flick. Lovers of fantasy, with macabre/occult imagery and themes, as well as colorful, visually striking images (ala Pan's Labyrinth, but not as iconic, and definitely nowhere near as serious or dark), those who appreciate irreverent humor and who do not mind subtitles if they need them, may very well like this film. It was definitely a 4.5 experience, for me, of a 5 star production. I was very entertained by it but I'm not jumping up and down that it was made, and I am in no rush to watch it again, so that's why it doesn't get a 5 from me. 5s are the best I can give, so I reserve 5 stars for movies that compel me to give them.",Positive
"Here's an idea, Amazon:  if you're going to ask me to watch something and review it, don't lie to me about the rating.  On your website and on my Amazon app on Roku, the show's rating is listed as NR.  Then, when I start to watch it, it actually shows it to be rated MA.  Prior to popular belief, not everyone wants to watch MA shows.  I'm still of the belief that you can make quality programming without all the overt sexuality and profanity.  Because for this reviewer, I don't need or want that coming into my home and if it's on there, then I won't watch the show no matter how well-acted, written or directed.  So, here's an idea - how about making a show that is NOT an MA rating.  You know, not all of us think the use of the &#34;f&#34; word is quality writing.  You sent me an email and asked for my review.  Well, there you go...",Negative
"I loved it was exciting, an funny  It was worth Watching. I would see it again If you like Sci fi this is the one.",Positive
At first I did not know how I would like this program - however this really awesome show - can't wait until I see Season 2,Positive
"The Walking Dead is on the very shortlist of shows I follow on a regular basis. Undead, gore, grimness aside, TWD combines excellent writing, acting, production to form a genuinely outstanding experience. It's worth the time and money to follow it from a reliable source like Amazon Instant Video.",Positive
"This show is an example of creative minds at their top level of writing performance.  The idea which is similarly used in the X-Men series, is taken several steps farther into the future and leaves the viewer with the feeling that we are getting closer and closer to the possibility that the technology suggested could actually become our present.",Positive
"Love it!Great show, filled with awesome characters that feel like they from a Sergio Leone movie and fell out into modern day Kentucky. Do yourself a favor. Go back to Season 1 Episode 1 and watch the WHOLE DAMN SERIES!!!!!",Positive
My four year old grandbaby absolutely loves Diego.  She can't get enough and learns well from the format.  Well done.,Positive
I love the show and am really upset that they are thinking or have already cancelled this show with an ending that leaves everything in the air !,Positive
"Bosch is a smokin', driven law enforcement officer... a detective with the gold shield... who has problems with the level of action he takes against those who are not fond of laws. After smoking continuously, and smoking a perp, he is accused of murdering the individual and he must not only continue his work for the department, but also prepare to defend himself against a civil suit for unjustifiable homicide. By the end of the pilot, enough work had been done by the lead actor to ensure a continued viewing to see how things will work out ... the acting is first rate, the writing is first rate, and this is a pilot with punch.",Positive
We knew the outcome of this one and it was still good.  It was a different take on the island Survivors.,Positive
Love Ed Oneil he totally shines in this sitcom. Crazy show that truly depicts how wrong things can go in modern life. Everyone in the show is funny they do an amazing job making you laugh.,Positive
"As other reviewers have commented the film, despite many outstanding performances doesn't do justice to Linda's true experience which you can read in her still relevant book &#34;'Ordeal&#34;.I compliment the film as a period piece because it captures the essence, the clothing and music and the very 'Vibe&#34; that defined the 70's - so often called the misplaced era - it was the magnificent albeit troubled era of self discovery and self freedom that was that fleeting and lost time post the Hippie era of the 60's and the rampant consumerism of the 80's.I remember the 70's with fondness, as I can remember the long lines of upper crust couples, people who never dare be caught in a porno theater waiting in line for hours at some of New York's most Prestigious theaters to see &#34;Deep Throat&#34; On the same token I dismiss any comparison to Boogie Nights - already an American classic where pornography is just business and the search for both family and home are the heart of the film.We don't get that with &#34;Lovelace' but it would have been nice albeit not the intention. As pornography has come of age, perhaps so have we and I believe no one is in a position to judge others. There's a sleazy underbelly to most any industry and we get a good dose of this in &#34;Lovelace&#34;For those interested in 70's you wont be disappointed with the films construction, continuity or performances - which all around are stellar however even these fine actors can't lift &#34;LoveLace&#34; above the mediocre. That said, if it appeals to you it's certainly worth a watch.",Positive
"Good comedian, the show is creative the way its put together and fun to watch. I imagine it is not for everyones taste, but my wife and I enjoy it and I believe we understand where she is coming from.",Positive
"Trite. Unfunny. Predictable. Unintelligent. Partisan.This is a show that had a lot of promise. You begin with Bill Murray in the opening sequence. You have John Goodman. Some other decent actors. The premise is comical right off the bat-- a handful of politicians sharing a house in Washington.But the writing is so awful, I can't imagine watching another moment of this program. Maybe I'm jaded, as someone who works in politics, but the scenarios and dialogue just weren't believable (think ""All the President's Men"" or ""The Ides of March"" or even the original ""The Manchurian Candidate""), nor were they quite farcical enough to be recognizable as some sort of absurdist lampoon (think ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" or even ""Thank You For Smoking""). This show is an attempted political comedy that takes itself and its ideological/partisan mission way too seriously. Political humor can be great, but, whether it's on the right or left, it usually falls flat when it's a vehicle for driving an underlying partisan agenda first and foremost. Good political comedy should be equal-opportunity offensive to both sides, or rather, to the system itself.SNL's Weekend Update, The Daily Show, and its successors are at their funniest and most relevant when they first lay bare the truth about the butt of their joke fairly and in context, giving the subject of ridicule a chance to legitimately make his or her case, and THEN and only then mock the stupidity/bigotry/misguidedness relentlessly. Alpha House doesn't give Republican viewpoints a fair hearing, nor does it add anything new to the world of political satire/parody. It just rehashes a bunch of junk that wasn't funny the first hundred times it was done, and more importantly, it's a chance to score partisan points primarily, and a vehicle for comedy only secondarily.That's what this felt like, at least, watching the pilot. A vehicle for Garry Trudeau's hyper-cynical, humorless, out-of-touch, leftist political agenda.Step one- Start by creating one-dimensional characters from the lamest and most overdone Republican stereotypes imaginable.Step two- Throw in some of the left's contemporary pet political issues. Social issues and global warming.Step three- Create weak ""straw man"" arguments from the Republican characters to discredit the conservative side of these issues.Step four- Now try to make that mess funny.Get Garry Trudeau out of this project, and with the cast and concept, it's probably a big hit. The next House of Cards, perhaps. Right now, though, no way does this catch on. Nor should it. Which is too bad, because John Goodman in particular does a fine job in his role, despite abysmal writing.",Negative

"this is JOHNNY QUEST with attitude. it's much funnier than Johnny quest was, but it has the same values: an unusual cast (JOhNNY QUEST, besides, having the coolest theme song, also had a cast that was multiracial, and this is in the 1960s), it has wit, and it  has verve.  The characters are fully drawn (not the literally, but they are well-written), and these characters play on stereotypes and preconceived and other preconceived notions.  Kudos to AMAZON. and i say Yeah.",Positive
the show like many others seems fake at times. i don't know if it is but it seems very fake. i just watched the first EPs. on prime but have seen it on TV so i can say some other EPs are good. you just have to give it a try if you like keep on watching ..,Negative
For years now I've taken to ABC series and it seems to me as soon as the show is doing REALLY well they dump it.  Loved Body of Proof.  I've completely dumped ABC. Deleted the channel from appearing on my TV. If they actually put on a series that is decent I'll wait a few years and see if my friends have liked it.  If so I'll watch it on Amazon or something.  But ABC is done in my house.,Positive
"So, I've been downloading this since it began airing and finally decided to watch it after being sick for over a week. One word: HOOKED!!!!!!!",Positive
Awesome stop motion animation makes this unique compared to the other pilots. So long as this is a completely done that way this is a winner .,Positive

"Such a great show. I'm glad to see them in New Orleans this season. So far, there have been some interesting challenges, and it is obvious that all of the chefs are very talented. Can't wait to see who wins!",Positive
I really wanted to like it but just couldn't get into it at all.  I noticed there were several seasons so I may try it again.,Negative
"Always entertaining, which I view as quite an accomplishment considering I'm not really a fan of cooking shows! See my review of last season because my opinion remains the same!",Positive
"Here's the thing about &#34;The Following&#34;, it's supposed to be a dark show. Cults are nothing to mess around with. If you look at history, thousands of people have died following a cult leader. While the &#34;Joe Carroll&#34; cult is fictional, the 2nd season adds in a look at what a real cult might look like starting in episode 7. It's isolated and guarded heavily.I actually didn't think they'd go to a second season. But now they just announced season 3. It makes me wonder what is going to happen over the last few episodes. There's a bit of a teaser in Episodes 7 & 8 of what is coming. It keeps getting better, especially with the new cast members.I don't know why people are ripping this show. It's really good if you give it a chance and can handle some dark themes. Yes, the show does have a lot of stuff that might push some boundaries. But that's why they have that TV-14 rating. It's not for little kids. It's intended for a mature audience. If you can't stand a show that is based somewhat on actual events, then don't watch it.",Positive
Too often shows decline as they go along. This 2nd year was every bit as good as the first. I love how there are no good or bad guys. The bad guys have redeeming qualities and the good guys have some seriously distorted things going on.,Positive
This show is soooo darn good. I had to add it to my series to keep collection. Hope it has More seasons to come,Positive
"My wife worked on the ""Hill"" for years. Having seen the machine that is American politics I can honestly eat this is pretty darn close to reality, albeit with hilarious political license thrown into the mix . Irreverent, charming, witty, with a great ensemble cast, I hope this series will be around fora long long time. Good stuff!",Positive
I like the quick tempo of the writing and the &#34;tongue in cheek&#34; humor. I am not sure how accurate some of the legal jargon is but I am not watching it as a tutorial and as entertainment it is definitely 5 stars.,Positive

I love this series. Can't wait for more. It has a little of eveything. So thankful for not much foul language.,Positive
"Don't know why this show didn't last longer than it did, although....I am a Jeff Goldblum fan and I've found that most people are not. Liked the subtle humor, witty sarcasm, and character interaction.  The premise was unique and opened the show to a lot more episodes than it enjoyed. Too bad.",Positive
"The pilot Bosch has got off to a good start. I'm very glad to see Titus Welliver--whose face I've seen often  on so many other shows, but I couldn't quite place his name. It's only the pilot, but the show's low-key approach kept me interested.",Positive
"This season has quite a few surprises, twists and turns I would not have predicted for sure. It is a very quick fast-paced seasonwith heartbreak in many storylines. Fans who love the supernatural freakiness will love this season. Those who follow for the Twilight-esqe thrills may lose interest after this season.",Positive
"Dont waste your money on season 4, wait for it to come out on Netflix so you can watch it for free. The entire season was blahhhhhh and the finale was even more blahhhhhhh",Negative
"Extremely well acted. Wonderful character studies. People change, people grow and nothing is predictable until the split second you see it coming. It's intense, thought provoking,edgy. It is anything but cliche ,but if cliche is what you seek  &#34;this show rocks! &#34;.,",Positive
Psych gets better and better with each season. You won't be disappointed by collecting this series. I noticed thou for the first time that both my purchases had the words disc made in Mexico on the plastic cover-what's up with that.

"""The first signs that something was wrong happened 6 weeks before July 4th."" While setting up for the big July 4th festivities a small town in Maryland discovers some residents dead and no clues as to why. The more the doctors investigate the scarier it gets until the whole town is soon infected. This is yet another found footage type movie but it isn't like most of the others. This one is done in more of a interview fashion with the footage being used to help tell the story. Also because of the director (who has done real movies such as Rain Man and The Natural) the movie is technically much better then most of these types. The problem is that even though it flows better and looks better it is still a little boring. The way it is presented makes it seem like more of a documentary then a horror and I was not really scared at all watching. I will say that if you are a fan of these found footage type movies then you will most likely really like this too. Overall, better then most movies like this but not scary and a tad slow. I give it a C.",Negative
"I was a bit skeptical of this show at first, but the Glee comparisons are unwarranted.  It has original musicfor all of its songs which makes it a very different beast.  It is pretty hilarious and I think it has a lot of potential.  I hope this gets made.",Positive
I enjoyed the characters and dialogue. All fresh faces do a great job and better than most sitcoms you'll see on broadcast or cable TV (although that bar is set fairly low these days). I plowed through the whole &#34;season&#34; in no time and look forward to new episodes.,Positive
"This season was interesting, but a little slow and most definitely out of touch with reality.  Why are they always changing Jane's/Deb's angel?  That Paul is the most flakiest, out of touch with reality, dumbest guardian angel ever.  He's too flaky to mimic reality!  I wouldn't wish him on my enemies.  I hope no one's angel is really like that.  I would demand a reassignment.  This whole season was out of touch.  Owen agreeing to be Stacy's baby's father.  Really?  If you needed ideas, for goodness sake do market research!  Sample random people, etc..The producers should have brought back cast members instead of explaining them away.  This was the most frustrating season ever.  After watching the beginning of season 6 tonight, I still have hope for the series.  It is the final season after all.",Negative
This show is one of my favorites of the last ten years. Few shows make me sorry when the episode ends. This is one of those shows. Each episode is so gripping for me. I love the way the characters and the plots unfold. It's magical.,Positive
Great Family entertainment. This show is always funny and keeps the humor clean.,Positive
"Teacher character, played by Adrien Brody, is not the typical one seen in these types of story.  In general I like these inner-city-schools type movies and this one pleasantly surprised with an original perspective.  Recommend,",Positive
"If you are into Sci Fi this show is for you, let's just hope that the show does not get cancelled after the first season like the event.",Positive
I was instantly drawn into the sweeping beauty of this movie.  The characters were well developed and evoked passion for them.  It made me want to read the book which doesn't often happen after a movie.,Positive
"I always thought Bosch would be best as a series on a pay network where they could deal with some of the more explicit aspects of the novels as well as the vast number of novels written so far.  This is great.  I wasn't sold immediately on Titus  Welliver (Lost, Deadwood) but he had me by the end.  Also, great cast including, Lance Reddiick (The Wire, Fringe), Jamie Hector (Marlo from the Wire) and the old guy from The Walking Dead. Very faithful thus far to the novel City off Bones. With the number of Bosch novels I could see myself watching this show for many years to come!",Positive
"Acceptable adventure film of the sword and sandals genre, set in Roman Britain, has some Roman soldiers, survivors from a massacre against the bloody Pict tribes, fleeing behind enemy lines. Historically dubious (the ragtag platoon includes, seemingly for PC reasons and ludicrously from a historical point of view, a black roman soldier), this violent and bloody, muscular and masculine film is, for all its flaws, certainly entertaining. I found this better and more enjoyable than the recent, similarly themed Eagle of the Ninth. The pristine, misty Scottish outdoors where this movie was filmed certainly helps. Acting is not the main point of this movie, as the actors have to put up with some terse, rough lines. Michael Fassbender, who was fine in the more recent X-Men film, fails to make much of an impression here as the top Roman soldier here, but Ukrainian model Olga Kurylenko, is surprisingly OK as the top warrioress of the Picts.",Negative
"A series about 4 US Senators living together like 50 something frat boys.  Sloppy, spoiled, bored and boring.  Trashy, trite dialog which would run half as long if the writers had to exclude the &#34;F&#34; word.  I found the characters totally unlikeable and found nothing humorous in this &#34;comedy.&#34;  We couldn't even make it through the entire episode and stopped it after 15 minutes.",Negative
"At first I thought, just another police drama but after about 10 minutes in I was hooked. A great adaptation of Michael Connelly's books and just as great acting. Interesting spin on a police detective up for murder of a serial killer investigating the murder on the side of a child. I want to see more.",Positive
Daria is hilarious in a weird geeky way. It is like insight to what a nerd feels and is treated.,Positive
"I was on the edge of my seat much of this season. And to find out it was cancelled after the little cliffhanger was bad news. Dark and gritty, and non-stop, never wasting time over political correctness. There were so many questions I needed to have answered next season. How could anyone not have been watching!!",Positive
"If you're a fan you need know no more. It was perfect. ""Laugh out loud"" funny. I want to write more but it would spoil the fun for those who have yet to see this episode.It's a treasure.",Positive
"I was afraid that this show had finally jumped the shark with season 8, but it seems like it has revived itself for season 9! They finally decided to end the recurring episodes featuring the evil computer hacker, which were seriously lame. Yay!!!",Positive
"Couldn't even make it half way through the pilot.  Didn't laugh once.  Matter of fact, didn't feel anything for this show.  It's as boring as staring at a wall.  The main characters are unlikeable and the dialogue sounds forced.Not sure who's approving the shows for Amazon but the two that I have watched so far (Alpha House and The After) have both been terrible.",Negative
The show is a great comedy but I am very happy to see it come to a close. I think the writers should have wrapped it up in season 8. It really could have been great ending a year earlier with Ted meeting the mother much sooner. I think the long stretch irritated the viewers. The show is well worth watching to laugh but the material ended about a year ago.,Positive
They just seem to get so close to a solution and then it slips away.  Writers for this show must have some serious creativity to not repeat the same issues over and over again.,Positive
Stargate Atlantis is one of my all time favorite series.  The cast is excellent and the plot takes a couple unexpected twists and turns that keep things interesting.  Just finished going through the series a second time and am sorry they didn't make one more season.,Positive
I started watching from listening to a lady he said she liked &#34;Falling Skies&#34;.The characters are well defined and you care about what's going on.The aliens depicted in this series are not all bad. I truly like this.I gave it 5 stars because I loved it.,Positive
"Some Episodes are better then others, but some Episodes are really good I enjoyed the season opening and ending I thought really good tv which is why I gave it 5,  Sometimes I wish Seasons were shorter so they could drop the weak episodes.  but in this case the weak episodes were not unwatchable  which is why I gave those a 3, so average out a 4It does have the cliche drug war view of 'drugs are the worst thing in the world'  and 'police have to bend the rules to get results' but not so bad that it distracted from my enjoyment.",Positive
Always dig their work. A very interesting way to learn the history of machines & society's urge to preserve it.,Positive
"This pilot was very entertaing and it has promise as a vehicle for a series.  Much of it was derivitive of other series like Girls on HBO, Californication on Showtime,  The reviewers who said the concept is unique are not seeing the formula, i.e., take an art, profession or particular cohesive group or segment of society and make an ensemble dramedy about the young, upwardly mobile talented few who stuggle for recognition in their fields while living active, sexually liberal social lives.  Girls does it with post-graduates.  Californication concentrated on a successful writer with sex addiction and writer's block.  There are many others; Entourage (actors),Nurse Jackie (nurses), Grey's Anatomy (medical interns and residents), to name a few.  More tame shows with the same concept would be Fame and Glee.  So the concept is not unique.  It would be great if a show like this became popular.  It would open up the diminishing popularity of classical music to a new generation of listeners and might make classical music &#34;cool&#34; to more twenty and thirty somethings.  Unfortunately, lead part is not given any back story or quirky behavior that makes her a compelling character. Lola Kirk, the actress who plays the lead is adequately good looking and a reasonable actress but she will have to become more unforgettable, in order to carry a series in which the pilot relied mainly on the secondary roles to get attention.Oh, and it has nothing to do with rating, but how does the second-cellist of the New York Philharmonic, recognize greatness in a young oboist by meeting her and sitting next to her in the orchestra pit of a rock opera?  And why was she there?  The second cellist of a great orchestra would not need to moonlight in a rock opera band.",Positive
"Despite some terrific acting performances (with Seth Rogen shining by dialing down his goofiness to a level that actually works) this whole thing is let down by a very weird script. At times the dialogue rings true and at other times it's just plain off kilter. The whole movie is off kilter. Trying to make Toronto seems sexy seems well so...pretentiously like the wannabe New Yorkers are that make up Toronto (sorry, director Sarah Polley, but you only reconfirmed what the rest of Canada thinks of people from Tarrana).I'll admit, as in the Making Of extra adds, that the lighting was very unique and a lot of what Polley does is good but I don't think she's yet capable of making a truly good movie until she gets a bit older and gains some life experience. The characters written seem stunted adults whose attempts at justifying their actions seem childish and childlike.Also, what was up with making the artist a rickshaw driver? Really, that's his part-time job? There're still rickshaw drivers in 2012 in the Centre of The Universe?Then explain to me what was up with the amount of showers Michelle Williams seemed to take. We even get a women's water aerobics class shower scene-a-go-go that runs like some Porky's meets health science scene.The biggest head scratcher is when (SPOILER ALERT) Williams leaves Rogen for the artist, we get a montage that features a FFM and a MMF threesome. So we're supposed to believe that throughout the lengthy chaste ""courtship"" that actually Williams was secretly a freaky sexplorer?The entire movie does not compute despite it trying to have a say on modern relationships.",Negative
I'm a big fan of this series. The constant fight with the wraith is exciting and makes for good character development. No worries no spoilers here but expect Ann exciting season with very high stakes.,Positive
I remember the bionic woman from many years ago and I guess it didn't compare to the original but I enjoyed it and was a little disappointed that it was cancelled,Negative
"This is the perfect comedy to watch when you need some mindless fun.  The guest stars abound, and the recurring jokes are a riot.  Great ensemble cast and because they're having a good time, you have a good time.",Positive
We found all the different personalities of the family interesting and enjoyed the various stories. We would continue to watch it so please do more episodes.,Positive
"My grandkids love it, so it gets a 5 star rating just for that. Always has an uplifting message at the end.",Positive
"This show is soooooo creepy and dark, and oh so wonderful!  The cast works together effortlessly and wonderfully.  You really believe everything that is happening from the nonverbal communications!I however, have not noticed a single thing different between the Blu-ray or the DVD.  This time it really is a personal preference.",Positive

"What a bunch of characters! Including the cops! This Cajun style version of &#34;COPS&#34; is both fun and interesting. The cops sure have a lot of expensive equipment that, hopefully, was funded by forfeitures from criminals and not the taxpayers.",Positive
"This is an excellent show, for those who like this kind of stuff.  There are so many true crime shows to watch now, a virtual explosion of them lately.  But somehow in that sea of crime shows this one stands out.  Joe Kenda is interesting.  He borders on being a bit smug and arrogant sometimes, but doesn't quite cross the line and you can't help but like him.  Every story is as wild as the last, couldn't stop watching them.  I hope there's another season of this show.",Positive
"Amy Schumer is hilarious.  Her comedy is edgy and shocking and laugh-out-loud funny.  If you enjoy Louis C.K., Sarah Silverman, or The League you are going to love this show.Every episode has something off-the-wall funny.  Furthermore, Amy can act well!  Her expressions are silly and crack you up.Just a great comedy series.  Cannot wait for new seasons!",Positive
"Without Marvel backing this would it have even made it to mainstream TV?  I doubt it.  I was hoping for so much more.  It does have promise, but it truly needs a swift kick in the writer's behind.  Maybe next year if it makes it that far.  I'm always wanting more.  More of what I haven't a clue.",Negative
"I love this guy that spends his life making animals fit in to lives where owners have no clue what they're doing usually. I mean this makes a good case that cats are smarter than some of the people that care for them.EXAMPLE: Having two cats and then buying a ""Ridgeback"" dog that is totally bred to chase and corner cats for a living!!! Then they scratch their heads wondering why this has gone bad and the cats fight with the dog. Just more selfish, stupid owners wanting what THEY want, and no concern for whats good for anything or anyone.My only small criticism about the show is that it seems every episode has the same solution.Exercise the cat until they can't stand up, and provide areas of retreat up high in the house on ledges. All the rest has not much to do with the cat as it does with the dumb owners.EXAMPLE:""Yes we clean the litter box for the two cats about every two or three weeks OR SO!!""I mean OMG....please......someone take the cats away from people like this and give them a home with someone that has a clue what love or caring is about.( the litter box needs to be cleaned every two or three days)Anyhow....Jackson is a great human being, doing some nice work and I love the show.Once again the problems are usually always not the cat as much as it is the owners, so most problems can be dealt with. Mr. Galaxy shows a lot of love for cats, and more patients for people than I have for sure. Good program!!",Positive
"If you loved a 90 minute film of Paul Walker in a car (&#34;19&#34;) you'll love another short titled Walker film &#34;Hours&#34; were he spends nearly the entire movie inside a hospital, particularly one room. During Hurricane Katrina his wife Abigail (Genesis Rodriguez) goes into labor and gives birth to a premature daughter who is placed on an IV and ventilator. As the hurricane intensifies, the hospital is evacuated until it is just Nolan (Walker) and his daughter and no power...except a hand crank generator. Nolan must turn the hand crank every three minutes or else his daughter will die. The film has some flashbacks to show us what a perfect couple he and his wife were. As the hours take their toll, Nolan fast and furiously attempts to get help, power, food, IVs, etc. in three minute intervals.Paul Walker did an excellent job with what was essentially a one man play. Unfortunately for me, I tend to find these one man movies, even when done well, less than entertaining. The film includes some footage of the storm and CNN news reports. The film is a drama thriller. It is light on the thriller part in order to make the production believable. Unfortunately it cut into the entertainment value.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, implied sex, no nudity.",Negative
"great show, plots a little boring, but its an all around awesome show, and I hope the seasons keep on coming..",Positive
"I have heard this was a good show for quite some time but I didn't have time to start watching the series until now. I am so glad I started! It's really good. I enjoy the story lines and I love the main charachter, Raylan!",Positive
"Since I haven't watched TV in over 5 years, I just keep an eye out for DVD's that sound interesting. Since the first season of Being Human was such a good buy, I bought it. The series was very enjoyable & I wasn't disappointed. I look forward to getting the next season (when it's a bit cheaper). I would be interested in seeing the UK version. It sounds like the first few episodes are the same in both series, but then maybe they each take off in their own direction. The UK version seems to have fewer episodes (per season) & is a little pricey. At any rate, as I previously stated, THIS version of Being Human was very enjoyable & I look forward to getting the next season. They could cut back on the amount of blood, however.",Positive
Dirty Jobs is the best series Mike Rowe has been involved with entertaining and yet informative. The best show for a teenager trying to decide what to do with his life.,Positive
There is nothing bad or off about Justified. Season 5 is the best so far.  The entire cast rocks it!,Positive
Good season. I have grown tired of the repetitive plots and increasing darkness but season 2 was still gripping and full of optimism.,Positive
"Love seeing this kind of dark, flashy nuttiness set in the classical music world. Excellent dialogue and acting. Also love the NYC setting. Hope it gets picked up!",Positive
Husband and sons have watched many seasons and really enjoy them all.  We've all learned alot from the mythbusters.  Highly recommend.,Positive
"The film has some effective moments of tension. However, the filmmakers attempt a backstory explaining the source of the paranormal activity is weak, which is the main failing of the film.",Negative
I have always been a fan of the Warehouse 13 series. Good family fun. I am pleasantly surprised to see this season 4 offered as a Prime membership bonus and am catching up on the characters and plots that I would otherwise have missed.Thank You for all of your Prime movies.,Positive
The Doctor is pure nonsense and I really enjoyed it. Rose is a great addition to the show.She is great.,Positive
"There were several places that couldn't have possibly been true to what would really happen after a nuclear strike; however, it did represent a small portion of what humanity would turn into in this country. I personally would have liked to have seen the storyline go a little more toward reality, but, I understand that our six-pack society, those who care more about the unreality of hollywood than current affairs, could not handle it. I really liked this show in spite and watched it on a marathon status.",Positive
I love anything Stargate!!!!!  One of the very few scifi series left on tv.....sad  :o(,Positive
"This show is trying too hard. I found it a mix of already popular shows (Modern Family, with a twist of Shameless), but it just wasn't working. I love Jeffrey Tambor's other roles, but I found him unbearable in this pilot.",Negative
"It's often hard to follow the language, but it all comes together and is a cliffhanger from episode to episode.",Positive
Having voices in one's head to assist with one's work is not crazy. That detective R gets a visual is a bonus. Really fun to watch each case unfold.,Positive
"This is a fun series to watch, very Hollywood style in a land of the very grounded. Fun to watch",Positive
This show started strong and we enjoyed it for several years but not so much in the last two years. The last season was Ok but with the intersect getting into so many people it lost it's appeal. I was also disappointed with the ending.,Positive
An interesting idea that will probably be poorly executed.  I just can't stand the same ole made-for-TV unrealistic human dialog and behavior.  The writing is low-grade amaturish mixed with corporate ineptness.,Negative
Love the Christmas specials. And the Christmas Carol has become a yearly favorite in our home. It is just such a wonderfully different telling of the old classic.,Positive
"but so far, I'm enjoying the journey.  Surprisingly well acted by the main character and a few others, though in stark contrast with some others in the series.Part zombie, part scifi, part drama.  Interesting show.",Positive
"Season 4 picks up several months past where the last season left off. Issues include the assimilation of Julia's adopted son, Victor; Sarah's progression into life with her younger boyfriend and with a new character, Sarah's boss, played by Ray Romano; Kristina, now the mom of three, is faced with a health crisis, which of course affects the entire family, including Haddie, who is off at Cornell; and Amber begins a romance with someone who is atypical of the men she tends to date. These are the main issues that start what looks to be another enthralling season of what arguably is the best comedy-drama on TV.",Positive
"With a great storyline, acting and (so far) writing, this is one of the best I've seen.  I love the time travel side of science fiction.  There are so many possibilities lining up here.  Jumping (not too much) from present to future is working great.  I'm sure we'll see some of the side stories of the &#34;freelancers&#34; that will add to the many twists this show is producing.  It's a winner!",Positive
The acting by all of the actors is superb ~ truly shows the diversity & perserverance of the human race to survive under &#34;extreme&#34; conditions!,Positive
I happened upon this show and wow I was hooked.  Great characters and fun theme. I would like to see more.,Positive
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF THIS PROGRAM.  I LOVE TO SEE THE CAST TRY AND WORK THINGS OUT.,Positive
"Butter starring Jennifer Garner, Ty Burrell, and Olivia Wilde is a fun and quirky comedy. Usually I don't care for satire kind of films because they are too ""smart"" for their own good, but this one is surprisely entertaining. Garner gives a stellar performance (her best role yet), her character if ruthless, selfish, arrogant, and tends to play the victim from time to time. Her husband played by Burrell is retiring from the world of butter carving and is having an affair with a stripper played by Wilde. So Garner takes over for him and enters into the next butter carving competiton, she will do anything to win especially since her marriage is just for show, and she feels this competition is all she has left. Very orginial movie, I highly recomment it!",Positive
"This show is never uninteresting. There is no filler. Character development is a given in most if not all episodes and the characters themselves are multidimensional, deep, and realistic, down to their flaws and politically incorrect behavior. It's a very ""real"" show. There is never any hokey BS or playing down to the lowest common denominator; the show has teeth, unlike some other ones I watch (e.g. Bones, which is hokey and all over the map.) Every episode leaves me thinking, ""Damn, that was some s***!""",Positive
I am hooked on the series.  Loved the interaction between the officers and the characters of the inner city streets.,Positive
"Really scary, with a passably good script and characters. Acting not bad either.  One of the rare horror movies that is worth watching to the end.",Positive
"We anticipated a new season and they are better than ever. Great Program and I love it. Characters are so real to everyday life. I believe they could do a better job in correcting their kids to send the message that kids need to have ground rules and need to be corrected when they break them. Too much for the lady lawyer to do, it seems.",Positive
It's a good film for young teens.  if you're over the age of 16 it's cute but that is it.,Negative
"This series is MUST TV!  Worth it just for the history story, but much more entertaining than most series.  The costumes are works of art and the actors are great!  I recommend the entire series!",Positive
Great show from the perspective of the other side.  I know FX likes to push the boundaries with the sexual content but this has a little too much.  I like to watch this on my Kindle Fire and when the scene jumps straight into a sex scene it is a little awkward if I am in public.,Positive
"You're going to need a lot more than naked Scarlett Johansson to save this film.  Yes, she is naked in so many scenes that I forget how many.  And the nudity actually made sense for each scene.  I think.Still, this movie has no plot--it wanders.  Its end is absolutely horrible.  The film explains nothing.  No characterization, no motivations, no antagonist, no climax--this film is NOT A STORY.  It is a dream-like succession of interesting and sometimes-beautiful cinematography.If you have a hard time with Scottish accents, forget this film.  I could hardly understand 90% of the &#34;dialogue.&#34;  And the men talking don't matter to the plot anyway.  In reality, they were captured by hidden camera and spliced into the film.  Really weird technique that only makes the movie less watchable.Be warned: There is a lot of nudity.  Scarlett is a beautiful, REAL woman.  Her body is like a healthy ideal for women.  But it gets a bit tiring.  Believe it or not.  And the naked men were not my cup of tea.  Walking into traps with erections.  No thanks.While the bulk of this movie is absurd and slow and pointless, the STRANGE visual beauty of the film is to be commended.  Even the naked bodies were lighted (or shadowed) interestingly.  The scenes are all creepy and make even the most mundane parts of our world seem alien.But save it for the art house!  Give us story!  Not a presentation of weird cinema.Why did I even watched till the last scene?  We learn nothing.  Our heroine accomplishes nothing.  In fact, she nearly SAYS nothing.Well, the visual weirdness of the movie is like a slideshow.  You begin to realize that you are NOT watching a movie in the traditional sense.  Instead you are just watching art.  Set in a world in which something alien is kidnapping humans.  I think.Under the Skin makes the book it is based upon seem like the ramblings of an idiot or a drug-addled, paranoid teenager.  I feel bad for the author.  I will not TOUCH that book now.AVOID Under the Skin, unless you want to learn how to make camera shots creepy.",Negative
"This is one of the best series on TV. An excellent cooperative effort between the BBC, American production and Canadian location.",Positive
"Loved this one....got involved immediately, writing is good pace, characters are interesting, plot is new and interestng. He it makes it!",Positive
"I have enjoyed TWD since I watched the first episode.  I haven't read the Graphic Novel version (I want to be totally surprised!).  This third season has had its ups and downs (no spoilers), but, for the most part, I could not have asked for a more realistically aimed series.  The fights are good, the zombies provide more than just a background, but they are not the all-over theme.  The drama with the main characters is.  They have enough sub plots going on that you stay interested, but don't get confused.  I am looking forward to the season finale this round as I want to see what they came up with.  Also, looking very much forward to season IV?",Positive
"I love this movie. After watching and rewatching on Netflix, I purchased on Amazon Instant for download to my Kindle Fire. I have to say, I was shocked to see such a low rating here on Amazon. I have become rather picky in what sci-fi movies I like, and find most of them cheesy, over hyped and without plot. Monsters is a well thought out, well executed Monster movie. Monster's is, in my opinion, 100% better than Cloverfield, which I got 3/4 of the way through and flat out turned it off never to return. Its better than Promethious and even a little better than Super 8, which I enjoyed but had issues with cheesy animation. Monsters is as much social commentary, I think, as it is a sci-fi film, its more cerebral than viseral action. Its not in-your-face thrills and horror. There is more off the screen suspense and tension is created by atmosphere, character actions/reactions and dialogue that front and center visuals. I personally prefer this type of suspense and tension, through characters, plot and setting rather than one screaming blood and guts scene after another. I find it more convincing and realistic. Don't get me wrong, there is still some blood and guts, but its not a ram rush dash from one bloody killing to another with zero plot or character development. If you are looking for a monster/alien movie that is a little more intellectual, plot/character driven, atmospheric and suspensful, you might like Monsters as much as I did.",Positive
I AM OCD SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND MONKSISSUES. LOVE THE SHOW . HAVE ALL THE SEASONS AND SO THANKFUL SINCE HE WILL NOT RETURN.,Positive
Give current events this is an interesting story line....Gives you something serious to think about...Survival in an unthinkable situation...However...I think the town is taking the situation way too calmly..but they don't have anyother  choice but to do so.Suitable for teenagers and up I THINK ..,Positive
"Just finished watching the first episode. I was reluctant to start watching a drama about spies and such; I'm just not much into that kind of drama. I had liked, &#34;Homeland,&#34; when it first came out, but like so many great shows that are instantly popular, it became, cheesy(?) and seemed to be going more for dramatics then actual drama. So, ya, I was skeptical about a similar show. I have to say I was immensely relieved to be so wrong. First, the casting is perfect; you wouldn't think Russell could pull it off, but she does so and does so magnificently. I know I'm wronging her about doubting her acting chops, mainly because I'm ignorant of her work beyond her , &#34;Felicity,&#34; years. But, she is absolutely wonderful in her role. And the chap they have playing her husband, (sorry forgot his name already, bad with those), is perfectly suited to both his role and well as being opposite Russell. Their onscreen chemistry is so much beyond just anything intimate, they really do seem like 2 people who have known each other for 20 plus years, but still get surprised every now and again. I also like that it was set in the 80s, mainly because those were my teen and early 20 years, so getting to see the lifestyle, and, particularly, hearing the music from then, again, is a wonderful treat. It's weird to really appreciate a show more simply because they play ONLY the music from the 80s (which they really didn't have to, but it's still nice they were that thorough.) I can see several seasons ahead for this show (I hope). It's premise is strong, and the potential for various plotlines is certainly there. A major perk for the show, I think, is that it's on a cable channel, and not one of the big &#34;4&#34; on primetime. Yes, they like ratings on cable, but they aren't as driven, it seems, to air shows simply to garner mindless viewers. The show is allowed to be extra sharp, witty, a bit graphic, and certainly more adult (in good ways) then anything you'd find on the primetime channels. If you are tired of singing, dancing, &#34;survival&#34;, watching millionaires play, type of reality shows that seem to infest every channel about number 1, take an hour out of your evening and give this show a chance. Even as I'm writing this review, I have episode 2 from season 1 playing in the background. Thank-you, cable t.v., and Amazon, for bringing a show like this to the small screen. It's sorely needed. And another, special, thanks to Amazon for bringing this show free to Prime members like myself. The shipping savings alone make the membership price (whatever that may be in the future) well worth the cost, but it's wonderful having access to movies and excellent shows like, &#34;The Americans,&#34; as an extra perk.",Positive
Who knew a serial killer could be so charming?,Positive
"This is second, maybe third, watching for me.  Excellent show.  Reveals the decadence of colonial life.  I wish Amazon would add the second season.",Positive
"A love affair between an Israeli man and Palestinian woman is obviously going to run into the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  That fact could have made this a very trite film.  The director and actors, apparently using improvised dialogue, keep this film fresh and original.  The acting is very good.It is also refreshingly short at about an hour and a half.  I have come to suspect that any movie over 2 hours is the result of poor editing.While it has nothing to do with the quality of the film I do get tired of all of the smoking that goes on in these foreign films.  Will they ever break with this 1940's Bogartian cliche?",Positive
"I love this series. It took me awhile to get around to watching. I tend to automatically roll my eyes at &#34;reality&#34; tv. I think much of it is scripted versus reality. This series might have some scripting in it but I don't care. It is fun to watch. It feels like family. You may not always agree with the people in it and you may find yourself rolling your eyes but that is what family will bring out in you. It does include prayer so if love of God and country offends you, you are warned. I wouldn't let it stop me from watching though. You'll miss out on a lot. Just like you would if you miss out on family gatherings.",Positive
"I read some of the other reviews before watching this and although they warned about the later parts of the series, I found even the beginning unclear and poorly developed.  We watched the first episode only and couldn't be bothered to follow up any further.  It simply was not entertaining and that is all we wanted it to be.",Negative
I'm so hooked on every episode of Falling Skies and I just finished all the Season and I wish that there was more!  Very good story line and lots of action and great acting.,Positive
Alpha House was just great fun.  The writing was witty and entertaining. Keep up the good work and I will be sure to watch.,Positive

Like history but LOVE to watch extremely inebriated people yack......and then they yack? Man-oh-man is this ever the show for you!,Positive
"It started great with the idea of people trapped under an invisible dome.  However because the show so far is not giving us any clue of what is happening outside the dome, the story begins to slow down.  It has a lack of a clear protagonist and antagonist characters. We have  crooked town counsel and a few crazy folks but none of this was caused by the dome.  Plus where are the pregnant women, infants and kids? The story has been done so many times that any fan of science fiction can easily predict the winners and losers. Now if there were some strange creatures coming out and in of the dome, then we would have a quicker moving story line due to the fear factor.  I am sure with King, that the novel is much better than this TV script!",Negative
As the headline said I found it a little predictable but then most comedies are a least to some extent.  If it is made I will watch it because being predictable doesn't mean bad and the jokes were generally pretty good and well written,Positive
Why is this show gone forever? I was so looking forward to next season. Leah was my favorite! I'd rather them cancel the OG mob wives.,Positive
I REALLY HATE IT BECASUE I DON'T LIKE IT THAT WAS REALLY SCARY AND WE DO NOT LIKE IT THAT WAS OK,Negative
this show is wonderful...mostly because you have a sense that there is real interaction amongst the actors...not just the characters they play but the real personalities of the people themselves.  i think that they enjoy playing the parts - they support each other off screen since the filming is doing is a small town they have to be good company for one another - just as  in the program.  i find myself rooting for the good guys and yelling at the bad...this is a good escape from reality - love it love it.,Positive

"Metropia is a 2009 Swedish production that has flown completely under-the-radar, despite fascinating and innovative animation that accompanies the pretty basic science-fiction storyline. I only came upon it by searching for Vincent Gallo films on Netflix. The availability of Metropia is a story itself. You can get the DVD or stream from Netflix, you can purchase a copy of the DVD on Amazon, and yet Wikipedia claims that this film will be released in North America by Paramount Pictures in 2012. Hopefully this last piece of information is true as it might garner this film more exposure.The plot is pretty standard sci-fi fare. The story takes place in Europe, 2024; the world is running out of oil and Europe's underground subways have been connected into one large underground tunnel called The Metro. Roger (Vincent Gallo) is a lugubrious call-center worker, paranoid about using the Metro, who begins hearing a voice (belonging to Alexander Skarsgrd) in his head. Soon the tries to turn Roger against his girlfriend Anna and his paranoia continues growing. After seeing the model whose face graces the bottle of dandruff shampoo he uses, Roger follows her. The woman's name is Nina (voiced by Juliette Lewis) and his involvement with her gets him entangled in a conspiracy involving the Trexx Corporation and its overlord Ivan Bahn (nightmarishly voiced by Udo Kier).Mind-control, paranoia, technology, dystopian world, muted colors, etc. Standard sci-fi stuff, but delivered with a European flavor. The story is intriguing but slow-moving, requiring patience from the viewer. It only runs 80 minutes, but if you're not ready to invest yourself into the film than steer clear until you are. There are times when it moves at a snail's pace, but even at its most tedious it always remains fascinating to behold. It's the animation that you will take away from watching it as it makes the film more accessible and adds a certain amount of depth to the actual story as well. The animation was done completely through manipulation of still photographs. People and locations were photographed, edited in Photoshop, and then animated in Adobe After Effects. This may give the impression that the animation is gimmicky or cheap, but it makes Metropia an experience like no other.This animation is both stunning and innovative, lending great atmosphere with its muted colors and making Metropia a visual experience with the potential to become a cult sci-fi classic. The nods to Orwell, Hitchcock, Philip K. Dick, and perhaps even David Lynch help too. If you have any worries about the film looking too ""computer-generated,"" let me assure you: this style looks more realistic than the motion-capture stuff that Robert Zemeckis has been championing for years and Spielberg is having fun with for his upcoming film. It's a slightly demented style, but one that draws you in.The voice work is perfect, providing you have no qualms with the story taking place in Sweden with two main characters that are obviously American. Gallo gives a surprisingly tender and sensitive vocal performance, while Juliette Lewis provides a perfect amount of sexiness and intrigue. Kier, meanwhile, is absolutely frightening. The voice work is very subtle and nuanced, avoiding cartoonish theatrics. Like everything in the film, it's downplayed and appropriate for the gloomy tone.This is an animated tale for adults with a mature storyline and the occasional moment of adult content (although there's nothing too graphic). It's a cold film with a strong emotional disconnect that fails to make an astounding impression, but it will stay with you simply because of how terrific it looks and how well-acted it is. It's no masterpiece, but it deserves to be picked from obscurity and exposed to more people as it's an impressive achievement.GRADE: B+",Positive
"Warehouse 13 is like a cheesy detective novel. Once in awhile you want to curl up and get lost in Travis McGee sort of world and escape to an impossible place, but a place that draws you into its possibilities and a make believe world.This is Warehouse 13, a cheesy sci-fi that requires a suspension of reality so you can float away into a pleasant escape.",Positive
I will watch Jesse Spencer and Taylor Kinney in anything.  I wasn't sure what their chemistry would be together but they have made &#34;Chicago Fire&#34; into a most loved new show for me.  The whole cast is wonderful and each character has their own storyline weaved beautifully into a modern day firehouse and all that happens on and off the job.  I haven't met anyone who watches weekly who doesn't love it.,Positive

I thought at the time she would make a great travelling campaign for the Doctor.  And low and behold, it was like the writers read my mind.  She is fun-loving, quick-witted and just a great addition to the season.",Positive
"I liked Zero Charisma, but it could use improvement.  The bulk of the movie was fun to watch, and I liked most of the characters.  The characters were a little dry toward the end, allowing for a lot of boredom to set in.  I expected some of the characters' personalities to be fleshed out a little more but was never satisfied with the character growth outside the main character.  To be honest, the main character doesn't grow much, either.  I did, however, like the overall plot and the concept behind it.  The ending was disappointing but also served a point: find enjoyment in your work.",Positive
"Duck Dynasty is one of our favorite programs, and Season 2 was no exception.  Stupid and funny as usual.  What else can I say?",Positive
"This show was not believable from the very start.  The whole garage was full of cars, with lots of jacks to lift the gate. And why did they have to make the French girl so impractical, she didn't even have the sense to put on sensible shoes and save her phone battery. I don't like it when writers try to make women characters so stupid. I know they all do it, but PLEASE!  Seems to be made for a very immature audience.  I would hope that adults would be able to put their heads together if it were a life or death situation and reality, as they knew it, was falling apart.",Negative
"This is a great new series with laughable moments, but historic accuracies with things like gangs and limited, corrupted law all the way to stealing elections.  Love this show.",Positive
"A good, solid, episode with a bit of humor and a few thrills. There's none of the sheer terror you'd find in a Weeping Angels episode, or the nightmarish horror of ""Asylum of the Dalek."" Sure, there's always an element of alien terror, but nothing that the Doctor can't handle. There's a lot on what the Ponds have been up to lately, more on Rory's father, the introduction of the daughter of a character from the old series, and a few other surprises. Telling any more would be, well, telling, and if you haven't seen this one I don't want to spoil it for you. I'd say this is my second or third favorite of the season so far.",Positive
"Eliza Dushku is on the cover of these DVDs and gets the most screen time in most episodes. However, Dollhouse's greatest strength and weakness is that it's not really about Eliza Dushku or her character. Let me explain.The concept behind the show is brilliant. A company programs people to serve clients in whatever capacity needed, from prostitutes to criminal investigators. The show really shines when it tackles the moral and ethical questions around this. Joss Whedon is very good about never portraying the company behind the Dollhouse as ""evil"". The characters running the Dollhouse are flawed but realistic and even at times sympathetic, yet they are engaged in this practice of servicing people. Fortunately, most episodes show us enough of this to make the show interesting.As for Eliza Dushku, she is ""Echo"", one of the programmed ""dolls"" in the Dollhouse. As such, she's generally not a character who makes any important decisions or engages in the compelling ethical drama described above. Rather, pretty much every episode she is brainwashed and made to serve a new client. This is where the show sometimes gets bogged down into a ""client of the week"" format. While Eliza Dushku can act, her acting isn't dramatic or overwhelming enough to make every new version of her character interesting in its own right. Unfortunately, this also means she doesn't really show any character development over the course of the series - after all, she's a new person each show.Eliza Dushku and her character ""Echo"" probably take up most of the screen time in Dollhouse, which is a shame. Her story - to the extent there is one - just isn't that interesting. However, there's enough of the other material to make Dollhouse worth your while.  When watching the show, I'd recommend paying attention to what seem like the ""background"" characters more so than Eliza Dushku. Some of them, such as Amy Acker's ""Dr. Saunders"", are absolutely brilliant. In a way, to get the most out of the show, you have to shift your focus from Eliza Dushku to everybody else.Recommended - 3.5 stars.",Negative
"Great character development, interesting interactions and excellent plot. I feel the episodes are somewhat disjointed, the first episode was excellent and hooked me. Following episodes, I rate as &#34;good&#34; and worth watching, but again, it doesn;t feel well connected.",Positive
"This is a Japanese gangsta flick from the directorial hand of Takeshi Kitano. It is a full throttle story of the Yakuza and the various families (or crime syndicates) that control the Kanto region. It is full of intrigue and double plotting but the one thing that runs as a vein throughout this film is violence. Good old fashioned, medieval, nasty violence.The Uber crime Lord is called Mr Chairman and actually does dress like some despotic ruler of a `democratic republic' like say North Korea. Even his servants wear the same white tracksuits - even when they are serving dinner, I think you will find that Debretts classes that as a massive faux pas, but hey these are Japanese Mafiosi types and so probably aren't well read.He discovers that two of his under lords have made some sort of pact to be `sworn brothers'  whilst both serving time in one of Japans 1 star detention facilities. This he does not like and so demands that a sort of insult be done to prove that not all brothers do get along. Well one thing leads to another and as face is lost, and a few other bits - like fingers-, the retaliations ramp up. The land and powere grabs all come at a price and the fortunes of each change with the rapidity of a guns magazine being emptied.This is acted, directed and filmed in a stylish and no holds barred way. It just roars along, and keeps the shocks coming. There are some well inventive ways of dealing with your enemies and some brutal violence that made me squirm. The Japanese codes of honour and rampant disrespect to your underlings are heavily in evidence. This is just naked greed meets unfettered ambition in a tsunami of double crosses and violence and I thought it was excellent.This is not one for the squeamish but all lovers of extreme Asian cinema will find a place for this in their collections. In Japanese with a smidgin of English, this is not that short a film but just flew by for me - highly recommended.",Positive
"Maybe we really don't need more cop shows, but we absolutely need more Bosch.  Titus Welliver seems like he was made for this part; everything else he's ever done, including numerous cops, has led him to this role and it fills out the suit of Harry Bosch to perfection.  The storyline was compelling and avoids the &#34;case of the day&#34; plot in favor of a broader, likely season long investigation. We only get the opening chapter in the story, but I desperately want to see where this is all headed.  This would make my much watch list instantly.",Positive
I didn't enjoy this program about a young woman who tries to con all her roommates in NYC.  Their isn't anything funny about stealing money or bothering your roommate while she is at work.,Negative
Great show love the characters great action and it's different from a lot of other shows on tv at this time,Positive
"I'm absolutely loving this show, however, it was a bit short lived.  Definitely rivals the amount of provocative material you see on FX, but it is not overbearing like some of the series that air on movie channels.",Positive
"Gary Trudeau has done it again.  Only in film and not just political cartoons.  But in actuality this show is his cartoon characters come to life in the form of politicians that are so much like clowns, and impostors that it is easy to laugh at them.  The stories while outrageous are entertaining, humorous and true to life.  It is truly a sad state of affairs that we have such a dearth of unqualified candidates running in our elections.  Oh my...makes me want to think more clearly about finding out the background of every candidate thoroughly before voting.",Positive
I loved this show!  I wish there were about 5 more seasons...  I'm still thinking about it and I watched the last episode over a week ago!,Positive
"I really liked the first episode.  You are introduced to all the main family members; the acting is very natural (the actors are so comfortable around each other that they feel like a real family).  There is comedy, drama, and a quirkiness that really works for me.  Also, great use of music.So far, this is my favorite of the Amazon pilots.If you like shows such as Six Feet Under, and indie movies such as Transamerica, you will enjoy this.",Positive
This is such a nice mellow show. There are fun lessons to be learned as the characters solve small every day problems and questions.,Positive
Amazon should pick this show up if they are deciding to do so. I think it's suspenseful and it high lights very good energy though  out the show. I love anything that has do with apocalypses survival as a unit and a story that is believable you can't go wrong with it. A good scare and a good thriller will make the show last a very long time.,Positive
"While Season 1 started out with some relatively weaker steps, it soon found its stride with a dynamic and exciting second half.If you just watch the first few episodes, you will likely be disappointed.  It takes the introduction of a few characters and some initial plot build up as it lets you in on each of the subplots that will be taking place.As the subplots build up and the characters get more interesting, you will start to realize how this belongs in the Marvel universe and how this window fits into the rest of the house.  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D shows a very interesting picture of how the Earth is defended at all levels, and what normal humans are doing while gods, superheroes, and the 1% are fighting off alien invasions.I'm hoping to give S2 a 5.0, but with this season's rough start and occasional weak points, I can only see fit to give it a 4.That being said, if you like the Marvel movies that are currently pouring out, I would strongly recommend you watch this.  Not only is it solid television a cut above the average, but given its interaction with the events of Winter Soldier, I would not be surprised if we see the events displayed within the show have effects on the movies to come.",Positive
"""Damages"" is that kind of show that has you on the edge of your seat  completely confused as to what is going to happen next and in utter surprise when you discover each piece of the truth. It was one of the best shows of last season without a doubt. The show centered around Ellen (Byrne), who begins to work in the lawfirm of Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) who is a ruthless, self-serving and completely unpredictable lawyer. She focuses her work on a class action lawsuit against Arthur Frobisher (amazingly played by Danson) for insider trading. The first scene of the first episode shows Ellen running half naked in a raicoat covered in blood in the streets of New York. In each episode we discover a new piece of the puzzle and the events that led to that first scene. The past/present technique is masterfully used making each viewer very involved in solving the mystery. The performance of actors is excellent and the show is amazing. Damages is truly a great show.",Positive
"I feel like a turncoat for giving this set only four stars, since I generally find the series to be top drawer.I have a few simple reasons. First, it is abbreviated, to only 15 episodes, filled out to 19 with four added from Season 4. Second, it is a transitional season, where Zach Addy, one of my favorite characters, is written out of the series with a MOST, MOST improbable conclusion to episode 15 and Dr. Lance Sweets joins the cast as a guest character in this season. I was not entirely keen on two of the main story arcs of the season, the return of Temperance Brennan's family, especially her father, played by Ryan O'Neal and the Gormagon narrative. Two other arcs, Sweets' book on Booth and Brennan and Angela's search for her Brazilian husband are pretty good, as they help introduce Sweets, and make the Angela / Jack romance more interesting than just constant dalliances here there and everywhere.The first two episodes from Season 4, which take place in London, seem to breath fresh air into the series, and promise good things. I also miss the early tension in season 2 between Brennan and Saroyan, and a more stable character in Zach Addy.",Positive
"I love all of the Inspector Lewis episodes because they make you use the little gray cells between your ears.  I loved him with Inspector Morse and I love him more with his latest tall,educated,elusive sidekick and the ongoing relationship with the blond ME.  The characters continue to evolve and are becoming more complex.  Hope Amazon can get more like these for Prime viewing.  I am totally addicted to these crime, mystery, type programs.  Give us more!",Positive
"I enjoy Vera because she is unglamorous and has a few demons from her past that the audience probably will never learn about.  She appears to be tough and anti-social at times, but she can be &#34;real&#34; with her sergeant, Joe Ashworth.  Joe is a loyal husband to his young wife Celine and their brood of kids.  If it wasn't for closed-captioning, this American wouldn't understand half of the dialogue.",Positive
"Justified is well written, well acted, and truly one of the best series ever for TV.  It captures the regional &#34;flavor&#34; without parody or over-playing the accents and cultural markings.  Each of the characters is multi-dimensional -- each has a good and bad inside -- and this keeps you wondering what will happen at each turn in the story.  You won't be disappointed in any way.  Watch it!  Now!",Positive
"This show is hysterically funny. I can't get enough of it.I like the fact that half of this pair of comedians is black and the other half is white. So with their multicultural background, they can make comical jokes about certain things on different cultural perceptions.2 comedians. Hilarious jokes. Stand-Up comedians with multicultural backgrounds who go back and forward with and build off each other's jokes. And they do sketch comedy as well. You wouldn't want to miss it.",Positive
"Fabulous.  Four terrific mysteries presented on four disks, all featuring the greatest sleuth since..............?Hercule Poirot (vividly portrayed by David Suchet) is called upon to solve some confounding murders.  The first disrupts his holiday.  A cantankerous old man fears someone is out to kill him and all the suspects are his relatives.  (""If I had an enemy I'd cut his throat."")  The second case is far more complicated, involving thefts, smuggling, and murder.  The third case, Murder on the Links, comes about when Captain Hastings (Hugh Fraser) has ulterior motives for the vacation `they' are taking.  They end up at the Hotel Du Golf and fall into a trap of instant intrigue.  The last mystery is the most fun.  It features the best guest star they've ever employed.........Bob, a dog with ball and just one trick he doesn't mind endlessly repeating.  ""Dog!  You will sit!""Happy to add this to my collection so I can enjoy them anytime I want.",Positive
"I'm so glade that I didn't spend 4 bucks on this movie I caught it on Netflix . I was so board to the point where I fell asleep if your expecting gore keep moving , if you're expecting zombie action keep moving, if you're expecting a good movie period keep moving. Folks please do not waste your money this movie isn't nearly worth it trust me. If I could give no stars it wouldn't show!",Negative
"I only barely remembered the trailers from this series when I decided to watch it, so I went into it with a clean slate. I really ended up liking the series for many reasons. It is a tale from the Cold War told from a unique point of view. The main protagonists were well cast to look like a nice young suburban family (which makes the fights scenes all the more thrilling because you don't expect Mr. Husband-Next-Door to be such a killer. I also like that just when you want to start rooting for &#34;the bad guys&#34; they do something really violent or negative and you get put back to square one.  An interesting series with great acting and a unique POV. What's not to like?",Positive
"I love this show. It's very funny yet very smart.I was hooked from the very begining.I recommend it, give it a try and you won't regret it!!!",Positive
if your interested in watching a woman whine like a little kid this might be the show for you.  I think my wife likes to watch it just to enjoy someone else go through pain.,Negative
"Well, here's the thing with this show: you already know the ending.  No bigfoot, squatch, yeren, etc. is ever caught by the film crew.  Or wrestled to the ground by the mighty Bobo.Still, the show is pretty darn entertaining.  The value in this show is that it presents all of the encounter stories you could ever want to hear about, presents some pretty intriguing evidence in the form of audio and video recordings, and delves into the little-known wild areas in every U.S. state except Hawaii.  They even go overseas to investigate things like the Yeren in China.So, if you value anecdotal evidence and are willing to accept the fact that not everyone who sees something is a liar or hoaxer, this show is worth watching.  The tales people tell are worth the price of admission.  Something is going on out there in the woods.Not to mention the fact that the hosts are a group of really cool, intelligent, enthusiastic people.  Bobo is my favorite.  He is a giant man with a big heart, a sense of humor, and an unwavering belief in &#34;the Squatch.&#34;  Plus, he is the only one who could possibly protect the team if an angry squatch comes lumbering into the show.Good stuff.  Worth watching.",Positive
"I will admit to some hesitation at even wanting to watch this show.I sit in Dialysis 2.5 hours a day 5 days a week. Sitting in Dialysis is hard, the recliner chairs are most uncomfortable having two 15 gage needles stuck in your arm is at best painful. Nor having anyone to talk to is the pits.what i did is bought (what was at the time) the only portable blu ray player on the market and started watching blu ray movies.i was told about Dexter by friends and everyone that told me about it loved t. ""it's about a cop that kills on the side"" they would tell me. after a few of them talked me sensless about it i thought i would try it.I loved it from the first show.Set in Miami, Dexter works for the police department figuring out how blood splatters from the victems of knife or gun shot wounds. but he has a darker side. he himself is a killer. his step father taught him how to channel his instincts and kill thoughs that are ""unworthy to live"".It;s dark, often funny, and very bloody. this is not recomended for those that can' stand people screaming and bleeding a lot. but it is for those that have a dark sense of humor",Positive

"This is a notable episode because it marks the end of four years of pointless digging. In season one, self-confessed morphine addict Jack Hoffman started rather aimlessly digging a hole in Alaska. His mining technique was to rather aimlessly dig shallow holes with an excavator and test the results. Based on a tiny bit of gold being found in one hole, he and the TV announcers claimed that they were on the trail of a million-dollar pile of gold at the bottom of the hole.It didn't matter that the spot to dig seemed to have been at random. It didn't matter that what they were doing made no particular sense economically or as mining. All that mattered was digging the hole deeper.Four seasons later, the hole was 130 feet or so deep and had yielded a marginal amount of gold. But certainly not enough to pay the expenses of digging it out and running pumps to keep the water out.And finally in this episode, they gave up. The hole would go no deeper.All credit to Dakota Fred Hurt. He managed to get paid for nearly four seasons of television work aimlessly digging a hole. He kind of showed that the way to make money in this ""gold rush"" is to talk big, look busy but do as little work as you can get away with. With enough phony drama, you can get a bigger television audience to watch people dig a hole than you could for all the nature and science programming that used to be on the discovery channel.My hope is that next season they find a new can-do guy like maybe ""Nugget Brain"" Wayne to go back to the hole with rock drills and explosives to get down deeper where that million dollars of gold has to be. Four seasons and 130 feet just is not enough.",Negative
"When I saw the pilot, I thought it would be a dud, but a few episodes and I was hooked. It sounds like an impossible theme to make laughs out of a weirdly functional dysfunctional family, but it works. William H. Macy is incredible as the manipulative, drunk, drugged birth father (it would so so inaccurate to call him the father given his history and behavior). I can hardly wait for season 3.",Positive
"Really, all I can go by is that my grandson keeps asking me to watch Deigo. I don't sit and watch it with him but I can hear him calling out the answers to Diego's questions and when it over he wants to watch another. I have seen a few episodes and I like how they get the child involved and it is actually a teaching show. So they are not just sitting numbly spaced out watching cartoons. One time I purposely called out the wrong answer and he corrected me! Great. I was just checking to make sure he was understanding. He is 2 1/2 years.",Positive
"Quick Overview: Trip (Dempsey) finds himself in the middle of a robbery, two actually, in the same bank. He is good with numbers, logic and deduction and quickly manages the situation in a comedic &#34;who done it.&#34; Two bands of criminals and Dempsey find clues that even more people are involved in theft.I thought this one was alright but I wasn't blown away. Banter between the criminals and Trip was my favorite aspect of the movie. He is constantly running the clues in his head which sometimes leads the bad guys to pointing guns at each other. The gentlemen who played &#34;PB&#34; and &#34;J&#34; were great.",Positive
"I really like Morgan Freeman; he seems to be especially good in movies about animals.  ""March of the Penguins"" was outstanding, and ""Dolphin Tale,"" while still being a ""weepy,"" was an excellent film.  Rarely will you find a more sympathetic character than Winter, one of the dolphins in Florida who are still worth rooting for.But Mr. Freeman and people?  Well usually they get along just fine.  But not here.  He's curmudgeony, but not curmudgeony enough.  He doesn't think much of it when a disabled kid is hopping around like a rabbit, and he's way too helpful when a little girl -- who reminds me of Abigail Breslin in ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" which surely couldn't be a bad thing -- comes poking around looking for inspiration on her next novel.  OK; maybe not novel.  But at least three difficult words of the week to appease her mom.This starring role reminds me of the character played already by Clint Eastwood in ""Grand Torino,"" a film that really worked for me.  Mr. Eastwood played it just right.  He was curmdudgeony and he was damned well proud of it.  Sure, Mr. Eastwood eventually came around, but it took huge effort and time.  And those are some things that this film, director, and Mr. Freeman should have used for inspiration.This movie is pandering, and it does one thing that a movie never must do with me:  play with my emotions.  Once you do that you lose me, and they lost me at ""hello"" (and maybe ""Welcome to Belle Isle"").  But I'll still go three because I am a fan of Mr. Freeman and Virginia Madsen, as I've said ad nauseum before.  I'm just not a fan of this film.  They should have given the dog a bigger part, as Mr. Freeman would have surely then been in his element.",Negative
"Director Stephen Frears (""The Queen"", ""High Fidelity"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"") and screenwriter D.V. DeVincentis (""High Fidelity"", ""Grosse Point Blank"") are back together again for a new film based on the memoirs of American writer and journalist Beth Raymer, a memoir about her experiences in the sex industry, amateur boxing and sports betting.The film would feature an all-star cast starring Bruce Willis (""Die Hard"" films, ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Fifth Element""), Catherine Zeta-Jones (""Chicago"", ""The Terminal"", ""Entrapment""), Vince Vaughn (""Wedding Crashers"", ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", ""The Break-Up""), Rebecca Hall (""The Prestige"", ""Frost/Nixon"", ""The Town""), Joshua Jackson (""Fringe"", ""Dawson's Creek"", ""The Skulls""), Laura Prepon (""That 70&#8242;s Show"", ""October Road"", ""Are You There, Chelsea?"") and Corbin Bernsen (""L.A. Law"", ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", ""Psych"").VIDEO:""Lay the Favorite"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  For the most part, picture quality for the film is very good.  Colors are vibrant and really look good outdoors.  Really good detail when it comes to closeups and colors black levels are nice and deep.  I didn't notice any problems with the overall picture quality, no aliasing or artifacts.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Lay the Favorite"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The film is primarily all dialogue driven and dialogue is crisp and clear.  Not a film where you would hear a lot of surround usage but you do hear a bit of the ambiance come into play during the film.  But for a film like this, the lossless soundtrack was appropriate.Subtitles are in Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Lay the Favorite"" come with the following special features:Deleted Scenes - (7:41) A total of 11 deleted scenes.JUDGMENT CALL:""Lay the Favorite"" may have been a fascinating memoir to read but as a film, I feel that the film tried to incorporate comedy but also be a bit deep at the same time but it just doesn't work.The primary character of Beth Raymer comes off in the film as a girl who loves her job of pleasing men as an in-home stripper, showing her body and getting what she wants but trying to make money and survive.  When compared to the original memoir, there is a much better story as Beth is trying to balance life at Florida State University and to pay her way through college life, she becomes a stripper.  But because of her not being satisfied or she was fired from these jobs, that's the reason why she moved to Las Vegas.I really don't know if the real Beth Raymer was anything like the film version of Beth Raymer but the film's first half hour tries to feature Beth as a naive sex kitten that who is a stripper, tries to have sexual relations with her boss and fidns a guy at a casino and has sex with him immediately after they met.While the film tries to focus on high-stakes gambling, you're left thinking...""really?"".  Not to say that Rebecca Hall's portrayal of Beth Raymer makes her out like an ""airhead"" but perhaps instead of focusing on the sexy side of Beth Raymer, at the beginning of the film, there should have been some glimpse of her brilliance with numbers that is later mentioned in the film.  That Beth is actually a smart young woman, not just some kind of vamp.  Also, unless you have an interest in sports-gambling, the film is really lacking in structure and not that entertaining.Of course, we eventually see Beth grow in the ranks of high-stake gambling when she moves to New York City and starts to make money for herself.  But by then, I'm wondering to myself, is this really a Stephen Frears film?  And what an unlikely film to find Bruce Willis and Catherine Zeta-Jones in.  But do give the film some credit in the fact that Bruce Willis, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joshua Jackson and Vince Vaughn made ""Lay the Favorite"" much more of an enjoyable film because they appeared in it.The Blu-ray release does feature very good PQ and for dialogue-driven film, lossless audio was also good.  And for special features, you get eleven deleted scenes.Overall, ""Lay the Favorite"" was a film that may have featured a talented director and also featured a cast of big names but unfortunately, with an uninspired screenplay, the characters weren't fully utilized and the film just lacks anything of interest unlike the original memoir that the film was based on. Probably worth a rental but nothing more.",Negative

"I enjoyed this first season of Anna Karenina very much.  This one of those literary classics I have always wanted to 'see' as a series or movie and I was not disappointed.  I wish the ending had been different, but then it is about her life as it happened, not how I would wish it for her.  It was narrow in its scope so that the story centered around the characters and their emotions without too much outside distraction from period fashion, politics, and world events.  I would recommend it to any student of Russian history and anyone who loves a love story; even a tragic one.",Positive

"If you want to rent it, go ahead.  There are a few decent things about it:1) About 40 minutes in, the tension actually builds while they're in the tent... but it lasts a little too long and is broken up by them trying to escape... which is commendable - you don't want them running, screaming out of the tent into the night like Blair Witch.  Too iconic.  But, still... it did drag.2) A little man candy, if you're into that.  Although, can I just say, I don't blame her for not marrying him... what a DOUCHE!  It's also hilarious to hear him complaining about LA as if he wasn't quintessentially LA.  Every word out of his mouth was like a bad line read.  At least she could act... sort of.But, yeah... I guess Bigfoot steals white women?  This is the moral of the story.",Negative
Heartbreakingly realistic performances by most of the actors along with an excellent script makes &#34;Angels Crest&#34; a must see drama.  It portrays the consequences of bad decisions in as brutal a fashion as I have ever seen in a movie.  The lead actor was outstanding if somewhat enigmatic. His heartbreak is as true to reality as I have seen any actor portray.,Positive
"Great idea to start allowing folks to share their home videos of their paranormal experiences, LOVE IT! I'm a &#34;to-the-bone&#34; cynic, and won't watch those re-enactments of paranormal experiences, why bother? Anyone can make something up. These producers should have enough material for the next twenty years of shows. Keep sending them in folks, I'll watch your home video. I have yet to see an episode I had doubts with. Check 'em out.",Positive
Can't wait to see more in second season.  The cast here is great and the crossovers from here to Chicago Fire are awesome.,Positive
I love Anthony Bourdain and I love the premise of the show.  He is very funny and encourages the audience to see travel and destinations differently than the norm.,Positive
"So, I like new things.  I recorded the first episodes of this.  I had watched about thirty minutes.  I had to stop it.  It was awful.  SO over acted.  They wasted so much time just showing stuff shoot or be blown up.  When the guy that looked like he was an 80s Bond villain screamed at the guy to tell him something, I said ""that's it for me.""  One of the stupidest shows I have seen.  I will not waste anymore of my time onIn short, bad, over the top acting.  Child like action made to make you feel intense, which it did not.  Never felt drawn in or engaged at all.  I just felt nothing.  I will try again on net flix or hulu plus one day.",Negative
"We loved the first season of Once Upon a Time on Netflix so much that we just had to get the second season as well.  It was worth its weight in gold.  Very entertaining and enjoyable show, and paying for a TV pass meant we got to watch it the day after it came out.",Positive
We Binged watched this whole series from year 1 through year 4.5. Really loved the writing and the actors. Almost addictive and just wish it had managed to keep going a few more years...as into at least 7 full years. But it is what it was and that was very very good the whole show went out on top and in good standing. But like a good book when it's over it's over. Onto find something else. We don't get cable/satelite so rely on the DVD's and great reviewers from fans here on Amazon to figure out what we might like and enjoy. Someone reviewing The Closer mentioned this show and so glad I took their suggestion up. I can't recommend one season over the other as they were all just great and pretty much as good across the board. It was a bit disconcerning when the younger females kept going through pregnancies and their figures changed considerably but the show handled it well and really todays world they pretty much go with the flow and except for some creative shots and clothing aimed not to point it out they do pretty good. I'll miss Mary and her side kick and glad they didn't ever put them together...good for the writers and directors and makers of this show.,Positive
Wish I knew what I had been missing by not watching this show! I absolutely LOVE THIS SHOW!! You will have your favorite lines & characters you will be hooked!,Positive
"Oh my goodness.  I truly enjoyed this series.  I hope, hope, hope they continue on with Heroes.  I was lost when I watched the last episode.",Positive
"I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this, but after a slow start the story really drew me in, and held my attention. Great actors, compelling storytelling. I couldn't believe when it ended because I wanted to have more. I love character driven shows, and this is one I will be watching. Plus any show with Titus Welliver, Lance Reddick and Scott Wilson is worth watching.",Positive
Its not a comedy but it would have been funny (funnier) if they didn't make Mechad Brooks do standup for all his lines. Oh look a new love interest puhlesse don't make me puke I think I can only handle so much drama at this point because well that new assistant was not funnyIts nice to see john stamos still working he I could watch....maybe if they didn't disguise dialogue as a rapid fire machine gun ...really people this isn't SUITS,Positive
"This is an enjoyable Psych episode that pretty much follows the show's normal format of flashbacks and improbable coincidental occurrences, and it works well. We like Psych and tend to watch the older episodes on Netflix over theRoku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player, but this episode wouldn't stream so we bought it on Amazon since it was the next in the series.No spoilers from me: This is a Christmas themed episode that has Gus and Shawn going to Christmas dinner at Gus' parents house where Shawn tries to impress Mr. and Mrs. Guster, but things don't go too well when a neighbor is found murdered.Sometimes the acting is a little over the top and often boarders on downright silly, but it is a very clever and fun show.Highly Recommended!CFH",Positive
"I suspect this season might have been even more exciting and engaging than the first had the writers' strike not cut it short.  Since it doesn't have to introduce the characters, premise, or plot, the creative team could tell a straight-ahead story that never stops accelerating right up through its final moments.  But as the ""alternate ending"" demonstrates, they drew up short just as they hit a new creative flowering.Last season's survivors struggle to gather their lives and move forward--no small task when you've saved the world but can't take the credit.  Scattered from Japan to Ireland and from the present to the medieval past, they orbit each other, struggling to unknot the conspiracy that binds them together.  But when old secrets come back to the fore, the heroes must face a new enemy: their own collective guilt.If I had to find fault with this season, it's the needless introduction of new characters who complicate the narrative arc.  This season has so many characters that some of them disappear for two or three episodes, and we sometimes don't notice.  Like the X-Men comics of the 1990s, when Xavier's mansion housed a strange, expanding army, it becomes difficult for the audience to keep all the angles in mind.But for all that, it remains a tightly structured and propulsive story.  It makes good use of popular science fictional standards in a new and inventive way, and it plays interesting characters with complex needs off each other faster than the speed of light.  I wish they'd had the chance to explore the bold options they wrote for themselves, but it stands as a worthy successor to the first season.",Positive
"Typical Christopher Guest!  Shades of Spinal Tap.  The lead actor is very good, he was good in the Kristen WIIG movie, Bridesmaids I think.",Positive
"This is an good show.  The premise is fairly unbelievable, but the acting is good and the action is fast paced.  I enjoyed season 1, but have nit yet bothered with season 2 and don't feel any rush to start it, although I will someday.",Positive
very very good show lots of violence tho like the actors winona boyd arlo and the chief marshall watch if you can,Positive
"I love the characters and the story line(s), both are interesting and intriguing. I highly recommend if you like supernatural fiction, because this show will definitely whet your appetite for more.",Positive
The characters are right on target. &#34;Prayer Brunch&#34; and the January 10th episode - the funeral were the funniest tv I've seen in two decades.,Positive
"I have to admit that I have enjoyed watching this series.  To be sure it dragged at times, and it was kind of the 'alien' version of Vampire Diaries.  But, it was enjoyable.  Too bad it was cancelled.",Positive
"Continues to be good, just not available after second show.  Please offer more of her clever programs of intrigue and mystery.",Positive
"The two main leads are fun to watch and work really well off of each other.  When I check my Kindle for new episodes, this is the series I check first cause it always leave me with a grin. (Hannibal, The Blacklist, Elementary are even better, but not always fun.)",Positive
"I even like the make up of this version 'the closer' because it seemed that Kyra Sedgwick? whine and moaned all the time.  Hated that cell phone ringtone but it just seemed she needed everyone's help to be the Big Closer.This concept is the opposite but Flynn and Louie Provenza? are the best comedy duo, well since Abbott and Costello?!",Positive
There should have never been a second season as far as I am concerned. Season one should have ended with and they lived happily everafter just like the fairy tale.,Negative
"Come on it's SpongeBob! I've been watching since my 16 year old was a kid, and 3 kids in it's just slapstick fun.",Positive
"I just learned the series was inspired by the recently released KGB files.  Very Cool, very scary, very good show.I am miffed that Season 2 must be purchased and is not included in my Amazon Prime membership (same with Boardwalk Empire another very good show).",Positive
"I loved it and was hooked during the first 3 minutes of the show.  Interesting character and the interaction is great, really hoping to see more of this show.",Positive
"Face it, 99% of all the ghosts/myths this group investigates are non-existent but it doesn't matter because, unlike Ghost Hunters, this show is really a travelog disguised as investigative documentary. I watch it to see what insane things Josh will do in the name of &#34;the truth&#34; and this season is the best in that. Remote locations, interesting histories, hidden tribes, with a dash of Survival thrown in.",Positive
"Smart-looking, sharp and funny.  Get rid of Sheena the crazy girl for TK.  Hope they get another season out of this.",Positive
"What show are the rest of these reviewers watching? I was excited to see this after reading the reviews, but barely made it through the first two hours. Incredibly boring, like a lavish network soap with all that implies. The history is sketchy; if you're going to twist history, at least make it fun and appealing in some way that the truth does not.This is one of the slowest and most unpleasant tv shows I have seen in some time. Then again, I don't watch tv, only tv shows on dvd that reviewers I usually trust found to be good. Guess that's not the best way either! Oh well, I found The Office (the funny version) and Arrested Development that way, so it can't be all bad. Didn't work this time, though.Pass.",Negative
"It seemed like a long 22 minutes but there were some occasional laughs.  Some in the cast appear talented. The humor is alternately slap stick and adolescent.  Just who do they see as their audience going forward?  I suspect it may be pretty narrow with this type of humor.  I would suggest they go back to the drawing board and re-think this. A couple of times I thought the show had possibilities but it kept lapsing back into silliness.  In the long run, that won't cut it.",Negative
"As a huge fan of Stephen King's written works, I was very excited to see this great story being adapted for television.  Upon conclusion of this first season, I am left with mostly praise for the show (although also harboring a few ""regrets"" in the process).For a basic plot summary, ""Under The Dome"" Season One sees the small town of Chester's Mill suddenly contained (sealed off from the outside world) by a dome that seems to appear out of nowhere.  When the town's police chief Duke Perkins (Jeff Fahey) gets too close to the dome and his pacemaker explodes, the town is thrown into a state of chaos.  ""Big Jim"" Rennie (Dean Norris), a town elderman, quickly steps up to fill the void, yet his intentions may not be entirely noble.  Other subplots that weave their way through this first season include the mysterious drifter Dale ""Barbie"" Barbara (Mike Vogel), the relationship he forms with Julia Shumway (Rachelle Lefevre), and a group of four youngsters who believe that they somehow have a connection to the source of the dome's ""power"".After the first 5-6 episodes of this season, I was immediately hooked into the story again (having read the book three or so years previous).  The production value is incredible, the dome plotline is typical King mystery fare, and the characters are also quite strong.  This was easily my ""summer show of 2013"", with me rarely missing a live episode (a rarity for me).  Basically, the show is strong in many areas and is infinitely better than most network fare these days.I would loved to have been able/willing to give this the full five stars, but two nitpicks drop it down a notch:First, it just isn't quite as good as the book.  This is a personal bias, of course, as those who haven't read the book won't ""get it"", but the book tells a much more dark tale than this show (probably a bit too dark in some spots for ""free TV"", hence the changes).  Yet, that being said, I was disappointed that so much was changed from book-to-screenplay.Second, and perhaps a more fair criticism, is that I did not like the decision for this to become a serialized show.  To me, this is EXACTLY the type of show that needed a definitive starting and ending date, and it really showed towards the latter portion of this season.  The first half of the season or so was incredible, but the second half/third was just ""good"" because plot points were drawn out too long and not as much ""meaty stuff"" was being covered in each episode.Thus, despite those criticisms, ""Under The Dome"" is still a fine show that I very much enjoyed watching over the summer months.  I hope that when the show returns it will commit to a finale date and let the drama continue to build (instead of start-and-stop).",Positive
I had watched this program from the start and toward the end I was surprised that anyone needing an intervention didn't figure it out but the truth about what happens to FAMILIES is exactly what it is.  AND not all interventions work.  That was the honesty of the program.  Sorry to see it over.,Positive
This show needs to be cancelled... it's not even funny anymore.  Ashton is an idiot... really can't stand that guy.,Negative
"The actors are mediocre, the action is quite slow, the story jumps from plot to plot, &#34;Col&#34; Weaver is hardly active in this season, unexplained things are happening such as a part &#34;alien baby&#34; born to Tom and Dr. Glass, infection of the new young doctor with the alien bugs, and on and on. Very boring!!!",Negative
"Deadfall is a white noir, instead of being told in the shadows of the mean streets of the corrupt city, it takes place in the wide open snow covered wilderness. It is easy to identify that Deadfall wants to conjure up memories  of Fargo  or any other Cohen brothers movie for that matter, but ends up simply stuck a drift in it's own snow storm of tedium. This isn't a bad movie, per say, but it is middling, predicable and more often than not, dull. Which comes as a shame because the movie has a real great cast that is game for something more meaty.Telling the story of Addison (Eric Bana) and Liza (Olivia Wilde), a brother and sister team that just stuck up a tribal Casino. A car wreck leaves their driver dead and them stranded in the cold Michigan wilderness heading for the Canadian border.  They become separated and Liza hooks up with a stranger, Jay (British actor Charlie Hunnam), an Olympic silver medalist pugilist just out of jail and already on the run again. He wants to go home for Thanksgiving, but they end up stuck at a roadside motel for the night. She pretends he's her brother and he pretends she's a playboy centerfold, and somehow through all this they fall in love.Also add another subplot involving small town cop Hannah Becker (Kate Mara), trying to prove herself in a man's world and dealing with daddy issues involving the local sheriff (Treat Williams), who may be her father, but he is also a sexist, arrogant lout.Deadfall starts off very well with a great hook, but as it goes along it becomes tiresome and conventional. The early cinematography by Shane Hurlbut is excellent with a nicely done car crash and an exciting chase on snowmobiles, but like everything else in this movie becomes more pedestrian as it trots along.Directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky, an Austrian born director who won an Oscar for 2008's the Counterfeiters, making a very mild mew English language debut. Working from a half backed script by first time screenwriter Zach Bean, who manages yo fit more clich&eacute;s in a ninety-five minute movie than just about anyone this year. Bean's script seems cobbled together by bits and pieces of other movies, and not necessarily there best parts. It's plotting, it is rushed and there is little or no character development.Deadfall manages to almost descend into self parody with it's obvious and contrived ending that feels like the old Humphrey Bogart movie Desperate Hours, which itself was remade by Michael Cimino and starred Mickey Rourke, with a very special Thanksgiving twist. A holiday showdown in the snow.A very good cast is all that keeps this afloat. Eric Bana is superb in the central role, a tough guy villain that is easy to root for. Olivia Wilde proves she's much more than merely eye candy here, she is sweet, scared and sympatric in the role, she makes Liza simply more human, and this could be Wilde's best work so far.Kate Mara is excellent as rookie police officer Becker, she's smart and tough with the offbeat charisma that Mara is good at exhibiting. She's pretty, but not glamorous, and gives a clich&eacute;d role a more firm footing in reality, or at least she makes it appear so.Charlie Hunnam is just okay as Jay, a poor man's Tom Hardy the role is so underwritten that the actor is given little time to do much of anything, he's just there as the movie's handsome stranger, a rather dull protagonist.Add reliable veteran performers Kris Kristofferson and Sissy Spaceck as Jay's folks, and Treat Williams as the sheriff, this highly capable cast really cooks. Unfortunately it adds up to more of a cold lunch than a holiday feast.Deadfall is a slight and unmemorable thriller, it's laughable in all the wrong ways and doesn't add up to a impressive Thanksgiving themed movie. Although it would be interesting to see what happens after diner, I mean some people have some explaining to do that could have added up to something more interesting than what we have here. This time of year you can do better. Give the gift of love and take some you care about to see something else.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",Negative
"This is a wild ride, on the one hand we've got this incredibly hyper violent bike gang made up of some really good guys. Seriously who would NOT want to go out for a beer with jackson, Opie, Chips, Scotty, Juice or Bobby Elvis?? Clay is another matter. Then there is the comparative morality of corrupt politicians, cynical, venal government agencies and morally compromised businessmen. So they get into all of these wild escapades, nothing is ever what it seems and the SOA is always about 15 minutes from death, destruction and prison as one scheme after another backfires. Someone should make a reel of the many ""oh s***"" moments in the series, whenever someone says it, it has already hit the fan. But it is never boring. I guarantee that if you buy the series you will be up all night watching it, simply to see what happens next. Highest possible rating.",Positive
"Based on first episode, I was not sure whether I would like this show or even bother to continue watching.  I really liked the way  Green Arrow was written in Smallville and the way Justin Hartley played it, so it was a bit of an adjustment to accept this different version.  Having watched several now, I plan stick with the series.  Story starts off slow, but they are now building the back story and character development very well.  Stephen Amell as the lead was a good choice for the tone of the show and direction they seem to be taking the story.  Another plus for the show... the actors Paul Blackstone and John Barrowman.  Both of these actors have been in other scifi or fantasy genre shows and are doing great with their characters in Arrow.",Positive
This is a great series to watch. it's great to see our friends in the north country on Television. The city are so clean.,Positive
The shows is good for riches who are affordable to pay too much for rent or own... I think it is a waste money to pay too much for rent .. or purchase... It is not worth to watch anyway as it;s my opinion.,Negative
"This series seems a bit like Lost in reverse: everyone is stuck in the same place but can't explain why.  I cannot put my finger on why this show does not gel for me.  Some good bits and pieces, but they don't add up to an interesting whole.  I doubt if I will watch beyond episode four.",Negative
"Dark Minions is a sci-fi comedy that's best described as a cross between Family Guy and Red Dwarf, with a little Dilbert and Cheech & Chong thrown in for kicks.  The storyline has potential, and I'm sure it would appeal to a lot of college-age viewers, but with a little fine-tuning it could be made to appeal to a broader audience.  Also, the drug references and usage are a little over the top, and it's been done before.As I said, it has great potential, but sci-fi comedy is a very tricky subject.  It would be great if this could be turned into a more serious (but also funny) series.  I just fear it could devolve into an R-rated version of Futurama.",Negative
"Exciting storyline, well acted Claire Danes worthy of her awards, loved it. Cant wait for the next series. would like the option of paying for all the episodes for one price.",Positive
"No one wanted to believe it, but it's obvious that Chris Carter is pretty much done as a creative mind. Similar to Kohan/Mutchnick, there's no diversity in the storytelling, so all we remember is that one hit. Just finished it, would not watch this anymore.Usually pilots can have a slow build and get stronger. This started strong and got worse. Get Aldis Hodge and Adrian Pasdar better vehicles please. Pass.",Negative
"Not a big fan of zombie flicks, yet I'm fascinated with the various means by which filmmakers tackle the ""end of the world"". Very reminiscent of the 1970s when disaster movies were the plot du jour for just about everyone with a screenplay and rented cameras.Now, because most zombie films are pretty standard boilerplate, there's no need to provide a synopsis since we all know the variety and variants that run the gamut from comedy to terrifying horror. However 'Contracted' took a fresh approach to the wasteland of the walking deceased. No pun intended.Tells the tale of Samantha, an average middle class woman going through a typical break-up. Hurt, angry and resentful - she finds herself at a party.Copious amounts of alcohol and drugs, coupled with the bitterness at her recent failed relationship, leads to an unwanted one night stand. And soon thereafter she notices that she's not feeling well. Really not well. She appears to be suffering some kind of active necrosis. However, the doctor and potent prescription medicines don't seem to be working.And she's getting worse.The quiet portrait of a young woman who is at the start of global devastation was a refreshing tack. Despite having some serious gore and yuck factor scenes that are stomach-churning, taken as a whole, the film seemed noticeably unadorned and surprisingly unfinished. In fact, what it could have used was a little of that old school rubber-stamp zombie magic.I appreciated the character study aspect, and Najarra Townsend delivered a very solid performance which gave life to her role. But there just wasn't enough action to warrant a solid recommendation.If you're a fan of the zombie genre - and looking for something different - then this simple film might be worth checking out. It delivers an unusual take on the corpse-filled land of the ravenous undead.",Negative
"Great storyline and good set work. The English actor really needs to leave, he is terrible and distracts from the others. I will see how the next release is to make a decision. The profanity is way over the top...no normal people talk that way so why do the writers need to have &#34;F&#34; words dropping left and right.",Negative
"I thought the pilot was well acted and the writing was good, but, it was slow&#8230;painfully so. I'll probably watch the next episode, but if it doesn't pick up, that'll be it for me. There needs to be some character connections to keep me watching and the pilot didn't have that. Maybe the next episodes will. Not buying the &#34;older&#34; rookie character; she's not that likable and there was no chemistry between her and Bosch, or Bosch and his partner for that matter.",Positive
"really bad movie that got worse as it continued, by the time it neared the end it became agonizing, how this was ever even considered for a series is beyond me",Negative
I just can't get enough of Raylyn and his adventures.  Seasons 2 and 3 got me thru the cold weather now I'm up at night watching Season 4.

"THE PARTIES AT the Hamptons are wild - especially at the Graysons. Season One gave us the murder at the engagement party; now we have a character dragged off to rehab at her mother's memorial service, the pregnant mother's swan dive at her baby shower, and the groom's arrest for murder at his wedding. My favorite character, the unpredictable Nolan Ross, played by Gabriel Mann, is dragged through serious trouble throughout the season.It's not looking good for him in Season Three either.Seems creator Mike Kelley and producers Mark B. Perry and Marty Bowen decided to opt out of their ""Count of Monte Cristo"" revenge motif and embrace the night time soap opera format - and it also seems there are plenty of people who love it once you count the rave reviews on Amazon. For me, it's not as good as Season One, where Emily Thorne (Emily Van Camp) donned her black hoodie and put the hammer down on those who had wronged her father and ruined their lives. I miss those photos, where she would cross off the guilty with a big red ""X"" after executing a clever payback.Now - surprise! - Emily has a boyfriend, a hunk she met in Master Takeda's school for revenge. There was no mention of this in Season One, but we are dealing with soap opera rules now, like is Amanda's baby Jack's or the result of a one night stand? Two major characters get over-the-top death scenes (where I began to wonder if they would actually die or not. They do.)Cinematography is excellent again, making the most of beautiful Southampton scenery, gorgeous sets and high fashion style. Madeleine Stowe, playing matriarch Victoria Grayson, wears a fantastic Vera Wang gown in the wedding episode; the designer is recognized in the end credits, too. Sound is just fine for this dialogue-driven show; the occasional ambient sound and special effect blends in well.ABC Studios also provides a generous batch of extras for Season Two beginning with three commentaries: executive producers Sunil Nayar and Melissa Loy, and writer/co-executive producer Michael Foley on ""Illusion""; executive producer/writer Mark B. Perry, writer/executive story editor Joe Fazzio and actors Nick Wechsler (Jack) and Margarita Levieva (Amanda)on another, and creator/executive producer/writer Mike Kelley and Emily Van Camp on ""Truth, Part Two."" The one with Kelley and Van Camp hint at spoilers for Season Three, so be on guard.There are three interesting featurettes: ""Schooled in Revenge,"" that gives us a peek at Master Takeda's new students in his martial arts school of vengeance; ""The Sound of Revenge,"" showing how iZLER composes music for the series; and ""Haute Hamptons: Dressing Miss Davenport"" with costume designer Jill M. Ohanneson again demonstrating how she chooses clothing for the characters, focusing on Ashley Madekwe, who plays Ashley Davenport this time. There are deleted scenes on each disc and the bloopers on Disc 5 are funny again, mostly because it's a treat to see the so-serious Stowe and Henry Czerny (Conrad Grayson) crack upWho knows if the series will return to its thriller format? Once sucked into soap opera, it's hard to get out of it. ""Revenge: Season Three"" will premiere on Sept. 29 on ABC.-- Kay Reynolds",Negative
"Police shows are best when episodic. You get to do character development while telling different stories each week. I don't want to watch 10 episode about chasing one case or following one trial. It just means that the facts, reveals and details will be drawn out and that at the end of the season they will give you one little nugget to make sure you come back next year. Not interested.I'd give it one star but Two guys from the Wire and one guy from Walking Dead is always worth an extra star.",Negative

"It is always nice to get out while you are on top, before you are caught with your finger in the pie. This is what a dishonest, cheating Robert Miller (Richard Gere) is attempting to do. This is a semi-crime drama that comes at you rather fast with no time for character build up. Robert Miller is unlikeable, but the film doesn't build character for anyone else. I found myself rooting for minor characters who are more honest than Miller, but not puritanical.Brit Marling as the overly smart daughter played a convincing role, but Susan Sarandon as the wife did not have the lines she needed to excel. The individual scene dialouge was predictable. The film is more of a crime drama with the financial empire and deals being part of the background dealings setting up Gere's character.Might be worth watching once. A film you will forget an hour after you have seen it. Not a keeper.Parental Guide: F-bombs, brief sex, no nudity",Negative
"First off, the name &#34;Syfy&#34; annoys the crap out of me. :P Usually their shows are really low quality, so I was pleasantly surprised by &#34;Helix&#34;. The actors are all very good, and the story, despite being less than perfect in terms of logic and continuity, is still interesting enough to keep me watching.My only concerns is that people involved with Battlestar Galactica are involved with Helix. BG was another show that started well and ended up in the crapper after half a season or so, so I am a little bit wary. I guess if the show starts to sail towards awfulness I'll come back and revise my review. :)",Negative
Keep an eye on this series. I see so many directions this series can go and I hope it will go. It also touches on some of the realities and emotions about life and freedom we all have. It makes us think of what would we be willing to do. And who is really right in this series. It's definitely not a cut and dry black and white good and bad guy/girl series. It will have you paying attention trying to figure out what is going to happen next and where is the story going to go? Enjoy!,Positive

"I've been a fan of Sherlock Holmes from books to movies since I was a kid. The books may be what drew some fans in but for me it was growing up with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce and Holmes and Watson, solving crimes by using brains instead of brawn. The recent films starring Robert Downey Jr. are a favorite now as is SHERLOCK on BBC starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Add to that a new updated version of Holmes in the CBS series ELEMENTARY, the first season of which was just released on DVD.Johnny Lee Miller stars as the famous sleuth in current times New York. Having recently moved from England his wealthy father has set out to help him by hiring a full time sobriety partner to aid Holmes with his drug addiction problem (fans of the books will recall Holmes dabbled in cocaine use). It seems that a problematic case led to Holmes downfall but he insists he's cured and not in need of help. His sobriety partner, Dr. Joan Watson (Lucy Liu), isn't interested in his opinion since she was hired by his father.Watson brings along baggage of her own. Her career as a surgeon was cut short by problems she had that led to a mistake. It doesn't take long for Holmes to ferret this out. Knowing that an attempt to dismiss her would be futile he instead takes her along with him whenever the New York police department calls on him to assist in a case.When in London Holmes made a friend of New York detective Capt. Toby Grayson (Aidan Quinn). Realizing what a help he could be in certain cases, Grayson calls on Holmes when the unusual case pops up. Fortunately for the series that happens at least once a week.The cases the duo work on range from wealthy Wall Street denizens to mercy killings in hospitals to plane crash victims. Each time while the rest of the New York police department thinks there is no foul play involved Holmes proves them wrong. As the series plays out we also come find out about why Holmes began using drugs and who pushed him in that direction. It was his infamous arch enemy, Moriarty.What makes this series work is the interplay between the two lead characters. Miller's take on Holmes is a quick thinker who sees the world completely different from everyone else. Nearly everything within eye sight is a clue and the fact that others can't recognize this is something that often infuriates him.Watson on the other hand is more interested in keeping Holmes sober, the job she was hired for. Throughout season one the opportunity for him to fall off the wagon comes on rare occasions and eventually even Watson realizes that he part in helping him is better served as a companion when it comes to his cases. Watson becomes someone to bounce ideas off of and eventually someone that Holmes decides would be better served as an apprentice of sorts. It's a choice that Watson eventually faces before the season ends.Placed in the hands of lesser actors this series would fall flat on its face. But both Miller and Liu bring something fresh to an age old story that works incredibly well. Miller's frenetic movements and habits as Holmes give him an edge that replaces the physical aspects of most detectives seen on TV these days. Liu's interest in helping Holmes through his problems while sorting out her own demons is played without bringing into the role a romance that would seem out of place with these two. While they have a respect for each other and what they can both do turning this into MOONLIGHTING or CASTLE would ruin it. It's better that they play off of one another than fall in love.The series has been renewed for a second season and thank goodness for that. It makes watching TV worthwhile when it's on. Until that season starts, and for those who made the mistake of missing it, the first season on DVD is one worth adding to your collection. While being a Sherlock Holmes fan helps your enjoyment of the series isn't dependant on that. Instead just sit back and try to solve each case with Watson before the end of each show.",Positive
"This show always is excellent, as far as british crime or mystery showsgoes this is one of the best ever made.  The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone"" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.",Positive
The characters are funny and yet serious when stuff comes up. I like the idea of 2 universes. It seems possible but maybe some of it was not believable. If you like time travel and duel universe situations this is the show for you. I enjoyed it.,Positive
"After I sat down and watched this film, I decided to get online and read a few reviews.  Interestingly, people are mostly very adamant about either loving it or hating it&#8230;I didn&#8217;t find too many reviews that were neutral.  I can see why some might balk at the idea of this film; after all, it basically &#8216;attacks&#8217; a wonderland that is dubbed &#8216;the happiest place on Earth&#8217;.  But what many of the naysayers may not realize is that the movie is a parody, and it is not meant to be taken literally.  This is even discussed in a &#8216;Making Of&#8217; featurette in the Special Features.  I personally loved the film, and I&#8217;m recommending everyone out there give it a shot, if anything to see what all of the discussion is about.As an independent filmmaker myself, I have to tip my hat to director Randy Moore.  He shot the film guerrilla-style inside of Disneyworld and Disneyland, and as a result, was able to achieve a monumental feat.  If you are not familiar with the word, &#8216;guerrilla&#8217; in terms of filmmaking basically means he didn't have permission to use the location or images he was filming.  He and his team bought tickets to the parks and then quickly shot their scenes amidst all of the visitor chaos.  The finished product is a remarkable testament to working hard to chase a dream.ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is shot surprisingly well, considering most of the footage was obtained using Canon DSLR cameras.  I am impressed with the lack of shakiness in each scene, especially those filmed on the rides.  This makes the movie so much more enjoyable and allows the audience a deeper immersion into the film.The acting is very good as well.  Roy Abramsohn and Elena Schuber do a great job as the bickering parents, but the kids really steal the show for me.  Katelynn Rodriguez and Jack Dalton portray the couple&#8217;s two children, and they do an excellent job with their roles.  Granted, they are not the focal point of the film, however they are involved in almost every key part and do a phenomenal job as such.  I particularly commend Dalton, for this is his first movie role (if his IMDB page is correct).But the dreamlike story is what wins me over with ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW.  Describing this film as &#8216;trippy&#8217; certainly does not do it justice, but that&#8217;s exactly what it is.  There are moments in this film where you don&#8217;t know whether to hide your eyes or rewind what you just saw.  Certain elements of the plot play off of urban legends related to Disney, while other pieces are simply just way out there.  But regardless of where the bizarreness comes from, it definitely entertains.ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is a big win for me, and I suggest you give it a look.  Be ready to either love it or hate it, though&#8230;and make sure you can back up your decision because it is a good bet you&#8217;ll be asked if the film ever comes up in discussion.  It will be available next week.",Positive
Like the parlay between various characters.  The action is very stimulating and keeps your interest.  Hope this show keeps on going.,Positive

"For those critics who always seemed to be surprised when Paul Walker gave good performances in his movies and seemed to chalk it up to the everything but PW's acting skills-this is the movie that proves he had acting chops.  He may not have aggressively chosen movies that highlighted his talents OR made a movie every year that kept that talent at the forefront but never doubt that he was a really good actor.  ""Effortlessly golden"" as James VanderBeek put it.  Yes...his acting was effortless which is why he didnt get the respect for it that he should have received (see Running Scared, Noel).  It is with such sadness that you will watch PW in one of his last movies hold the screen by himself for almost the entire length of the movie and give a most excellent performance.  You look into his eyes in this movie and you see a father dealing with the loss of his wife while simultaneously trying to keep his newborn baby alive and dealing with all of it during a massive disaster named Katrina.  The scene in which he is looking for his wife in the morgue is heartbreaking as he quietly demands that she be given dignity in her death.  The scenes in which he is talking to his baby about her family and quietly putting pictures on top of her incubator as he does it is so powerful.  I will miss all that this movie would have allowed him to achieve.  RIP Mr. Walker.  You were a most excellent talent.",Positive
"The caption on poster says it all: Fight the Dead; Fear the Living. I've noticed that the group takes the walkers in stride now. No fear, as long as they are not outnumbered, even leaving one stray walker alone. The focus of the show has shifted from fighting the dead, though that is still a big emphasis. Now, it seems that learning to live among the living in peace has become the order of the day. And it's not going real well. I've said it often... this is not my normal genre of show. But something in the first episode captured me and has held me rapt for every show since then... it's not a show about dead people, it's a show about relationships among the living in a world gone mad. If everyone is infected, the situation will probably never change for these folks.That provokes a sort of desperation in their living and clinging to each other. I could go on and on about this show. I don't watch any other show with this type of theme. Nothing compares.",Positive
"For Series 6 LWT (London Weekend Television) ran out of short stories and reverted back to the two hour format used in season 4, drawing stories from the longer Poirot Novels. (Series 5 used the Short Stories.)This would be the last series for LWT to produce Poirot.  Granada Television would do a hostile take over of LWT and the Poirot series would go on hiatus until the A&E; Network would pick it up in 2000.Technically this would not be a real broadcast season as it was spread out over three years. It is just the last of the LWT productions.The classic two hour mysteries are:42  6-01  01/January/95  ""HERCULE POIROT'S CHRISTMAS""43  6-02  12/February/95  ""HICKORY, DICKORY, DOCK""44  6-03  11/February/96  ""MURDER ON THE LINKS""45  6-04  16/March/97  ""DUMB WITNESS""Even though these were filmed in 16mm, re-mastering them in Hi-Definition from the original 16mm camera films will produce a sharper image than the old 1995/1997 standard definition transfers made from 16mm copies, created from 16mm dupe negatives.Now if only A&E; would re-master their series 7, 8, 9, &10 from the original films, UNCUT.

Riveting. Some plot twists are predictable typical for the genre but it is alright beccause the acting is pretty good,Positive
"""Hounddog"" is a fairly predictable period piece about a young girl growing up in the rural south in the 1950's.  Dakota Fanning is impressive as a 12-year-old obsessed with Elvis Presley, and the supporting cast (David Morse as her womanizing father, Robin Wright Penn as her would-be mother, and Piper Laurie as her tipsy grandmother) is fine as well.  I'm not sure what all the fuss was about - there's nothing particularly controversial about this film.  Yes, there's a rape scene - but nothing shown in this film couldn't be shown on network television during prime-time.  Compare this to the harrowing (and deservedly controversial) ""Bastard out of Carolina"" and you'll see what I mean - both films are set in the same time period, with similar characters and circumstances.  But while ""Hounddog"" offers up clich&eacute;s as answers, ""Bastard"" forces its audience to confront the realities of poverty, child abuse, and rape.The problem with ""Hounddog"" isn't that it stretches the boundaries of morality and good taste - it's that the film itself is so derivative.  It feels like an odd mix of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" and ""Carrie"" - lots of nice scenes of dirt-poor kids bonding in swimming holes and corn fields with a little holy-roller craziness thrown in for good measure (Piper Laurie's character seems cut from the same cloth as her role as Sissy Spacek's mother in ""Carrie"").  This is a pretty film, with lovely country vistas and a nice hazy nostalgic quality that can be captivating on its own.  But there's nothing new here - just about everything that happens is predictable, including the final scene.  And all the snake symbolism is way, way overdone (I get it, I get it - ""stay out of the tall grass"").This is not a bad film, and it is worth seeing.  It is not, however, worth getting worked up over.  If you don't like ""Hounddog"" it won't be because it sexually exploits children.  It does not.  It just tries to present a picture of what it would be like to grow up poor and alone in a world that doesn't offer much support.  This movie is not about sex; it's about loneliness.  And on that level it's effective.",Negative
"Drama at its finest, suspense that leaves you anxious for the next episode and an unforgettable cast. Altogether, this one really delivers.",Positive
"Thought it could be good in theory, but just didn't find myself caring about his kids, which I assume would be a big part of the show. It isn't that it was poorly acted, just that they aren't interesting.  As he said, they are a bunch of people that only care about themselves.  I get enough of that in the real world.  Could use at least one kid that is nurturing or nice.",Negative
"There are only three characters in THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALICE CREED: two kidnappers and the rich young woman that they grab for ransom.  Most of the story takes place in a single setting, the apartment where the criminals hold the girl captive.Not wanting to be a spoiler, that's all I'm going to reveal about the story of this smart, fast-paced British thriller from writer-director J. Blakeson that is filled with some very surprising plot twists, as well as superb performances from Gemma Arterton, Martin Compston and Eddie Marsan.This is, indeed, one of the most intense, grittiest caper movies I've seen in years, and I cannot recommend it too highly.

I have a ""TV Pass"" for several shows currently.  If this isn't resolved soon, I may just pull all of them AND my ""Prime"" acct.

This is a much watch because you can probably identify with the various characters in the show and think of someone you have in your league.  This is not a show to watch with the family (some crude references).But it is a must-see.Randy,Positive
"I like a show that touches on subjects that were once taboo (I won't say what because spoilers) but I'm not sure about the acting.  The dad and sister (top left of the photo) are interesting, but I don't feel a connection to the rest of the cast yet.  Hopefully that comes further along in the season, but right now I find it hard to relate to the bunch of selfish brats that make up the rest of the cast.",Positive

"In this drama about the world of the CIA, NSA and others of that ilk it is refreshing to find that thinking, connecting one bit of evidence to another and analysis are given precedence over skull bashing, car chasing and mayhem. Not that violence is wholly absent, oh no, that would never do, but, it is the lesser force in this well acted, beautifully scripted and addictive piece of television. It is a pity that there are only two seasons of it.",Positive

I WATCHED SUITS FREE WITH KINDLE FIRE AND I WAS HOOKED. THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF 'LAWYER/COURT' SHOW.SUITS begins  with an adorable fellow who comes in a law office and applies for an associate position. He never went to law school and has passed the bar for many others who have gone to law school. One of the partners (to be) hires him anyway because the guy is a genius and little by little his secret is found out.The story starts there and the storyline(s) and cast are perfection. If you have a Kindle Fire and Prime (worth every penny) check it out for (I think) three seasons free and I guarantee you'll be hooked!I can't wait until the next episode comes on and I can watch without commercials (I hate commercials).,Positive
"I watched two movies last night (The other one was THE FIELDS) and both movies showed promise but both ended without satisfying resolutions.ATM sets up a simple but intriguing premise:  three young business people stop at an ATM, only to be terrorized by a psychotic killer.  Suspense ensues with some incredibly stupid plot devices.  First and foremost, why does David park so far away from the ATM kiosk?  As does the security guard.  Why does Corey lie about having a lighter?  Other questions would serve as spoilers so I won't go there.Brian Geragthy, Josh Peck and Alice Eve are fine in their roles and director Chris Fisher uses the claustrophobic setting effectively.  Too bad his script didn't measure up.ATM could've been a tidy little thriller but ultimately is a misfire.",Negative
"This is a good series with Damien Lewis, of &#34;Homeland&#34; fame, playing a former LAPD police officer, who returns to the force after having been wrongly imprisoned for twelve years.  He's received millions of dollars for his false imprisonment, but rejoins the force to track down those who set him up.  It appears that there are only two seasons, but we are enjoying it.",Positive

Now in Season 4, it is an eternity to wait for the new episode to come out!Difficult to start this series anywhere other than the beginning as there is a lot of background that carries over.You will either be a fan or you won't.

"I just finished watching the third season DVD set, and while Stargate Atlantis is still my favorite Sci-Fi show, I was rather disapointed.Here's why.(Warning!  Spoilers below!)First, story arc failure. I was expecting a huge advancement in the story arc concerning the Wraith, but it just didn't happen.  Sure, they appear in a few good episodes, but it didn't seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.Second, killing off Dr. Beckett.  I really liked him.  Maybe I'm dating myself a bit here, but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head.  This very lovable character will be missed.Third, rehashing the replicators.  With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series, why do the replicator thing all over again?  It was original enough on Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too.  Are they going creatively bankrupt already?Fourth, rehashing old sci-fi standbys, like the ""weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other"".  Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode ""The Naked Time"" and wasn't it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series?Fifth, bringing back a whole ship full of ""ancients"" just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode.  So, the ""ancients"" have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device.  We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two.  Couldn't an ""ancient"" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters?  Wouldn't that have been interesting?  They could have helped explore the rest of the city.  Their ship could have been recovered.  There's so much that could have been done with them that wasn't.Sixth, lack of character development.  Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom, but she seems little more than a pretty (to say the least) face with a great body who never uses contractions (reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie) and tilts her head a lot.  And then there's Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he's still there.Still, the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of.  And, of course there's the wealth of special features and commentaries that you get as part of the standard package with Stargate franchise DVD sets, and that greatly adds to the value of the set.I haven't seen any of season four.  Here's hoping.",Positive
"NO SPOILERS:Had no intention of offering up a review and recently cleared some stored episodes from my DVR (despite having 800-hours of capacity).  Then I saw the large number of 5* reviews and the doubt crept in!  Could I have missed something here?  Do I need the rest of the year off from submitting reviews?  Did I, during the few episodes that I watched, focus too much attention on scenes where RR was changing in front of her partner and as a result missed the multi-layered plot complexity?  NOT!The dialog seems forced, the plots are not overly interesting and the only thing to keep me vested is the hope that Maxwell, after a particularly vexing case, shows up @ King's with a bottle of Cloudy Bay, a meatball pizza and massage oil, asking if he would like to practice ""jousting""!Metacritic's gave the show a rating of 56, which may be a tad generous.  There is nothing offensive about King & Maxwell, so if you are suffering from insomnia and C-Span is not in the midst of an open debate on naming the State bird of Delaware, go for it!",Negative
"A Black man who hangs in front of a liquor store gets killed.  A Latino in a car gets killed by a white guy.The Black guy's case reminds me a bit of the tragic Jeffrey Dahmer murders.  Dahmer killed a Laotian boy whose brother he molested years earlier.  Here, the Black man is killed by the same man who put him in a wheelchair.  On tape, they show the Black man refusing treatment when a bullet grazed his body.  If he had sought treatment, maybe he would have no longer been in the murderer's sight and would have lived.  This may be a lesson to those who fear hospitals and taking care of themselves medically.The other case involved a Latino guy, a white woman, and a white dude.  When one officer states that he suspects prostitution may be an underlying matter here, his white female colleague responds, ""A white guy and a Hispanic fighting!?  It had to involve heroin!""  It turns out she was right.  However, I don't understand how the race and gender of the combatants were a signal of that.  The white guy actually ended up being chivalrous: he tried to take all the blame so that his female partner wouldn't be punished.  However, his female partner easily cracked.  It didn't take but a second for her to start crying and admit that this was a robbery gone wrong.  I don't know why folk on this show are crazy enough to steal from dealers, but this isn't the first time it's happened.One police officer is a chunky, Latino guy and it was funny to me that his last name was Osorio when ""oso"" in Spanish means ""bear.""  The white murder suspect says something shocking.  First, he said, ""Could I face the death penalty?"" and then he says, ""May I please face the death penalty?""  Perhaps this can be something from which drug addicts can learn.  I also hope the suspect gets the psychotherapy that he so obviously needs.",Negative

"I was around for the beginning of the pc, in Silicon Valley. It's nice to imagine that there were buckling swashes masquerading as cutting edge, rapaciously smart, self revving wunderkind who sipped energy drinks while shagging blondes with one hand and editing information hierarchy with the other. However. If one can get past the easy stereotyping for modern audiences, I suppose this show is easy to swallow. It's just that, after seeing other shows on air now, that invest more time in building a solid structure to build in to instead of coining stereotypes to play off of, it's really hard to accept Heineken for Budweiser.",Negative
What can one say about a show that is so inventive and leaves you on the edge of your seat at the end of each episode.,Positive
"This movie was really rather predictable. Even the ending, I had a sense of the last minutes of the film, in the first 10 minutes.Really interesting idea for a movie, but it was not executed very well. It is a little like SAW films, but less entertaining, and with a plot that is totally transparent.The acting was pretty poor, the characters where never developed, you never even find out the reason each character is there except the main one. It is almost a half finished film in that regard. It is very short, I can not help but wonder if they chopped off an hour or so of the film.While the camera work is not low budget. Everything else about the film is. A lot of opportunities for any kind of special effects are skipped with the camera cutting away, then the results seen.At the time of me writing this, the movie had 5 stars. Though the movie is not exactly 1 star, it is more like 2, I can not justify giving it two stars. Because someone might actually think it is worth renting. IT IS NOT.At best this is a Sci-fi channel movie. It is as bad as a B-Movie but with none of the charm, or quirks that really make those types of films enjoyable.Please do not rent this movie. But if you do, be prepared to write a review, so others do not make the same mistake. If proving me wrong is worth $6.99 by all means go for it. But there are much better ways to spend your money. This is not worth 6.99 to own let alone rent.",Negative

"I have always loved Dame Agatha's writing including Miss Marple but this second series is so well done. The series starts with a 2 hour (approx) special that truly documents the primary meeting between Arthur Hastings and Poirot after Poirot escapes from Belgium ahead of Hitler. Well filmed, excellently characterized and delightful although there are aspects of the plot line that are expected, detracting from the mystery. Lots of clues, lots of red herrings and good viewing while quilting or crocheting.",Positive
"We like these shows set in England in the 1800s and thereabouts. This one had a happy ending, which I like, but plenty of challenges to overcome along the way!

They should've created feature films for release in theaters of these tales.I hope we'll see more of these actors in the future.,Positive

"So far its very well done. The acting is first rate. The blocking in the shots is some of the best i have seen. The story is both disturbing and interesting ( but come on were talking about Hannibal here of course its disturbing! ) This is a quality show, but if you dont like graphic violence dont watch. Personally I think id watch it just because the acting is so good. ( praise for the dialogue as well, nice job writers. ) This is not a show for kids. ( there was a seen in one episode that i found disturbing and I grew up on scary movies.) So all in all if you like psychological thrillers you will probably like this.",Positive
I like the group of misfit characters they have assembled as NY police detectives. The stories are good and the characters interact very well with each other. I wish there were more than one season to watch.,Positive
The life and times of the Beta group is interesting.  I like the character development and look forward to future episodes and seansons.,Positive
"This show is hilarious.  The antics of this family keep my family in stiches.And it is an easy to watch, positive, uplifting show.",Positive
Silly science fiction fun. Like Eureka it is light and very hard to believe science fiction fun. Likable characters and villans. Recommend for any science fiction buff. Does have adult themes so not for kids.,Positive
"At the time of this writing, I have only watched the first three episodes of the second season of Devious Maids (however, I plan to watch the most recent episode and others as my schedule permits). Watching the last three episodes of Devious Maids Season Two was an easy decision for me due to the fact that I have also previously enjoyed watching season one when it was released to the public in the summertime of 2013.  It is best to watch season one of Devious Maids prior to watching the second season in order to better understand the motives of both the maids and their employers for season two. The second season is set up in a way with a fresh new story that those new to Devious Maids can watch the second season even if they did not watch the first.  This is because the first season dealt with solving the murder of one of the maids while the second season deals with different issues involving relationships and the strengthened friendship bonds among the maids. Please know that I do feel that many of the actors and actresses in the second season contributed to why the last three episodes of Devious Maids Season Two are fun to watch (especially the third episode: my fave episode so far).  However, I would have to admit that my favorite characters from this show (for both season 1 and season 2) would have to be Judy Reyes as Zoila Diaz and Susan Lucci as Genevieve Delatour.  Judy Reyes carefully portrays an overprotective mother in season two who is doing her best to try to be less rigid and is not afraid to express her true feelings to those around her.  Sadly, the man she loves wants to take a &#8220;breather&#8221; from their relationship and the drama between her and the daughter.  Obviously, I am rooting for her to have a positive breakthrough in the midst of all this(spiritual, psychological/personal and/or professional). Meanwhile, my husband (with cautious neutrality) understands why I would prefer the breakthrough. However, he guesses that the Devious Maids writers may be setting the Zoila Diaz character up for some time of drama or nervous breakdown.  We owe each other certain meals depending on who turns out to be correct in how the character of Zoila Diaz. I like Lucci&#8217;s Delatour character because she plays a happy spirit who keeps her head up and stays positive about her present life and future regardless of any serious drama that pops up. The added dimension of having the Delatour character showing genuine concern and sisterly/family type support to her long-time maid Zoila Diaz also adds the heartfelt qualities to her character.  The only gentle suggestion that I would make is for the possibility of the Genevieve Delatour and/or the Zoila Diaz character undergoing some type of professional training for a side professional career and/or entrepreneurship. Devious Maids Season Two is great for those who have watched and enjoyed the previous season and/or those who like light-hearted shows with a touch of mischief.",Positive
Its short and sweet and you want there to be a happy ending. I prefer quirky over cute and predictable.,Positive
"I'm a big fan of Joss Wedon's ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long Blog"", so I'm not opposed to the concept of a TV musical. However, where as the music in the aforementioned title never failed to put a huge smile on my face, the musical numbers in Browser's were just cringe-worthy distractions from the rest of the show.I disagree with a number of negative reviews of the cast. I thought they were all very well cast, their character's were likeable or interesting and I'd actually be interested in watching them sans music and with better writing. I thought they all showed some acting talent, even if they didn't always show musical talent, but since the version of the show I'd like to see would not be a musical, that would hardly matter.I thought the directing and production values were on par with a network TV show, but the music just held the entire thing back. Whether the show could be successful would depend on how well the writers could fill the portion of the program currently wasted on the cheesy musical numbers.Sadly, since the show is from a Grammy, (as well as Emmy) winner, I tend to doubt he's be willing to trash the musical concept and try to make it work as a sitcom.All that said, I still found myself wanting to watch another episode, to ""see if it got better"", so it definitely had some of the ingredients needed to make me want to watch more.",Negative
my wife and I are completely hooked on this show. We sit around and watch entire seasons over the course of a weekend,Positive
"Brad and his team keep it real, but also have an aspect of fun to their sleuthing. The subject matter varies from mildly interesting to truly shocking.",Positive
Got this to help my husband keep his BBT collection growing. We both really enjoy the show and its even better without commercials.,Positive
I always come back for the next episode and haven't been disappointed so far.  It's really a good show and well worth looking at for a couple of episodes until you can really decide that you like it.,Positive
"(This is the wife of Richard...just so ya know.)I had my doubts at the beginning of this movie, but I ended up LOVING IT! Great cast, very different story. Glad I watched it.",Positive
I can only say that I would watch anything with Jonathan Rhys Meyers in it!  This actor brought new life to a character that's been over-done so many times.  You'll love it.  Don't start watching if you can't follow thru to the end!,Positive
Not sure if it is scripted or not. Parts were entertaing. The partner should not have left when he did.,Negative
"I loved this season of 24. I loved almost everything about it, even the death scenes. I felt like nobody was safe, and anybody could die! I especially loved the episode where everyone is trapped in C.T.U. with the nerve gas everywhere. I also loved the surprise ending with Jack being taken hostage by the Chinese who were still after Jack from season 4. I highly recommend this season to all fans of 24. And I just saw the season six trailer. I've watched it over three times and I can't wait.",Positive
I FELT THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS VERY POORLY WRITTEN AND EXECUTED. IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ALL EYE CANDY AND NO SUBSTANCE.,Negative
"Could be an interesting topic, but, like so many shows out there now, it basically just throws a bunch of meaningless sex, profanity and non-likable characters at you. Too bad - the subject matter is pretty unique and could have been developed into an interesting storyline, but I'm just so sick of everyone sleeping with everyone else and not caring...same old, same old.",Negative
These &#34;Housewives&#34; series used to be somewhat entertaining but the &#34;players&#34; are just so self-involved the show has become painful to watch.,Negative
If the rest of the season is like the first episode Amazon might really have something here. It was funny awkward and everything the Onion should be! Really hope this one keeps up!,Positive
"I liked the first season... bought all the other seasons with that in mind as I didn't discover the show until much later than it first started.... and haven't really watched them. I was hoping it was more like the Walking Dead than it is.... the first season ROCKED in my opinion... everything else just feels a little like &#34;well, what do we do now with the plot?&#34;Kinda wish I could give away my 'owned' season 2 and 3 of this show.",Negative
fx packaged this wrong by saying on the lable that there was commentary on an episode when in fact there was not...FX owned up to the wrong typing on it so that was nice...but before a product goes to a store FX needs to check their packaging. this has nothing to do with the seller on here..but the original person..FX,Positive
"This is one of my favorite comfort series and is great for a good cheer up.  Hyacinth's life revolves around appearing &#34;better&#34; than her station would really allow and is hilarious.  Having someone of high quality nod at her in her mind makes her best friends that she can brag about.  Patricia Routledge is excellent in her role as are the actors her play her husband, friends and family.  If you haven't seen this show, you need to.  You won't be disappointed!",Positive
"Oswald shows how friends should act with one another, this show is a little young for our house but I'm glad it's made a comeback.  The sweet words from one another show the kindness that kids should see on tv, not the way some of the older kid shows project ""friendship""",Positive
"For the time this series was on TV, this show covered issues that could become a reality sometime soon. It has silly humor and dray humor interspersed. Not only that, but also unafraid to joke about controversial issues that producers are afraid to touch today. You may want to give it a few episodes to get into it, like the Eureka series takes.",Positive
"This was a really fun movie to watch.  I thought it was well done, the acting was engaging, and special effects were believable.  I didn't have much expectation going into it, but came out wanting to purchase this movie and I will.  It was that good.  So for a fun ride, some moments you find yourself getting caught up in the story, and a decent ending, I recommend this movie!",Positive
So far pretty good -- humor is good and the acting good. A bit of a liberal interpretation and slant which makes it look one sided but for a political parody funny.,Positive
"I love this show, even when the story isn't the greatest or it gets slowwww.  It's almost in that category of shows you don't admit watching (at work).  Right up there with Nip/tuck, dexter, etc.  Wish they would add more episodes per season; this isn't England!",Positive
"A entertaining serial about an agent who gets in trouble, has romance, comes up with solutions to problems that work almost magically. Good support.",Positive
"A well done show. entertaining, superbly written, engrossing, well developed characters, and a lot of fun. would watch it again",Positive
"I don't understand what the other reviewer is complaining about here.  This isn't a random episode selection from Season 4 like he says.  It's just what it claims to be ""Volume 4"".  This set contains the second 16 episodes from Season 3 and continues in chronological order where ""Volume 3"" leaves off.  They are releasing all the episodes just in instalments of 16 episodes.  And I think it's just fine considering the content you get for the price.  I'm glad they're picking up the pace on this aswell as American Pickers...just wish there was news about the next set of American Restoration.",Positive
I don't know if I was having too much fun watching interactions between Williams and Geller that time flew by or that it was actually that short.  I will be watching more of it though.,Positive
I Really Enjoy The Movie It Was Very Good Movie Like I Sayed That My Favorite Movie Zombie I Never Got Tire Too Watch The Movie.,Positive
"This show just keeps getting better and better. I would recommend this show to people who enjoyed Lost, as they are (at the core) very similar in nature.",Positive
I really enjoyed this Star Wars spoof.  It reminded my of the Freak Brothers comic book but in space.  The parts that were in stop motion looked great.  I hope this gets picked up.,Positive
"I liked this season just as much as the first season. It was great! Keep it up. We all have our favorite people on the show, but regardless its great their family is so tight knit. That is something for us all to make happen.",Positive
"I loved this show and wish there were more than three episodes! Zen is the only honest cop in Rome -- and watching how he brilliantly maneuvers around the rampant corruption to maintain his integrity is fascinating. Shot in Rome, the show is as authentically beautiful as Italy itself. A truly unique drama and Rufus Sewell is wonderful as Detective Zen.",Positive
"White Collar is my favorite TV show of all time.  Great scripts, great sets, interesting characters!  And, is there anyone more handsome than Matt Bomer?  It is my fervent hope that those responsible for producing Season 6 can get their act together and end the series with a full season - not the possible mini series that I've read about.",Positive
This series has the staying power of Gunsmoke brought into modern times. Lead and supporting actors are fabulous and the stories keep you guessing with heart rending twists and turns. Well done!,Positive
"Another one of those curiously short tv series that got cancelled mid season, this is interesting enough to wonder what it might have become as it matured.  As it stands though, it has not quite found its identity - though the 14 episodes it ended up as, showed promise.It's the beginning of the jet age, and Pan Am epitomises cutting edge sophistication.  The lives of a flight crew, 4 stewardesses and the captain and co-pilot, are explored.  This exploration ranges from the intriguing world of the sexual mores and burgeoning liberation of the time, a little social drama, the burgeoning feminism of the 60's, and - somewhat ludicrously - some spy drama thrown in for good measure.  Starting off as more or less stand alone stories in each episode, the series seems verging to a soap opera dynamic by its close, somewhat letting the characters down with the romantic entanglements coming to the fore.  If any of this sounds an intriguing mixture, within a show steeped in meticulous recreations of the period and consultants who were there and did it, then a cautionary note is that it is steeped in candy coated bubble gum style - the 60's are stylised through rose coloured glasses, and the Disney parentage means that the deeper issues that the series hints at are arguably never properly portrayed or investigated, though this does leave it watchable by a wide audience.Somewhat of a let down then in terms of what it could have been, I'm ultimately not too disappointed that this was cancelled - and yet it was something of a guilty pleasure while it lasted thanks to an appealing cast and intriguing milieu.",Negative
Love all these . .I always admire anyone who is really good and talented at there jobs.  These people are really imaginative and its fun to watch them work under time restraints,Positive
"Yes, it's another cop show...and it's a good one...with a dark, serious edge, yet retaining sober realism and pacing without relying on over the top, hyper-graphic situations and visuals, so often used as an easy crutch to artificially impart dramatic tension for the ADHD generation.  Make this one, Amazon.",Positive
"The show is a cast of performers who weave in and out of relationships with each other as they pursue fame and fortune in country music.  No new ideas but the actors make it compelling.Can't help but love this ensemble of very talented singers and very soapy scripts. Lots of original music.  It's worth it for the music alone.  Connie Britton  produced this show and she is the least talented singer here, but a totally believable character as Rayna James, the &#34;earth mother&#34; Queen of Country Music.  Britton is the &#34;Oprah&#34; of acting.  You just know she could be your BFF.  Everybody likes her. All the supporting cast is wonderful, except perhaps the young lady who plays Britton's teenage daughter Mattie.  She is a little overdramatic with the teenage angst stuff but even she has a wonderful voice (I Have a Life That's Good).  Hayden Panettiere is the young , self-destructive drama queen is rhinestones. Hayden carries it off well though her vocal talents are nothing special.  Chris Carmack has great stage charisma as a closeted cowboy selling his sex appeal to young female fans and terrified of discovery. The standouts are  Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio, as wannabes looking for their break. These two have absolutely amazing vocal chemistry as well as being fabulous solo singers.  You will be ordering their &#34;If I Didn't Know Better&#34; single and just about anything else they sing. This may grab female viewers but guys who watch will likely become addicted.",Positive
Enjoyable story.  Action to satisfy the junkie.  Surprisingly good television .  The special effects at times seem a little cgi but the storyline makes one forget.,Positive
"The jokes in this show come at you really, really fast, but they start to become tired after a while. I felt like this show was trying to be 30 Rock, but lacks the character it needs to generate better dialogue between the characters. This show, like Alpha House seems to be more concerned with being a satire rather than getting people to care about its characters, or develop an interesting story.",Negative
This is a wonderful show. I don't understand why it was cancelled. Anyone that likes survival stories will love this program.,Positive
Very average. Not very interesting at times. A lot of eye candy gets thrown in t keep your attention as the plot very slowly unfolds.,Negative
I hope this show makes it to round 2. It was very good! Great laughs all the way through. I'm surprised this show was even a question for the green light. I can't wait to see the rest of it.,Positive
"Accessible people, food of several kinds, music.  With a sense of perspective and humor.  Nice picture of Austin, South BY Southwest, with its oddities and community.",Positive
Hilarious! Love the actors! They do a great job! Kind of reminds me of my college days! Hahaha! Can't wait for more seasons to be added,Positive
"... and wanting more. An interesting take on group response to a catastrophe, one that puts an entire community in a terrarium. Stream it on Amazon Prime, like I did and enjoy it even more without commercials.",Positive
"I love the host of this show but when you've seen one, you've seen them all. Again, it's good if you just need some background noise to whatever you're doing.",Negative
What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said?  It is absolutely the best rendition of this story ever filmed.  It is my go-to movie if I don't know what else to watch.  And it seems new and fresh every time.,Positive
"It can be difficult to &#34;catch&#34; an audience with a pilot and right now, I'm about 50-50 with this series.  I saw the secret of Jeffrey Tambor's character a mile off (and no, I'd not read any spoilers).  The characters are so far only marginally humorous -- not what I expected from the creator of Six Feet Under and United States of Tara.  But due to that pedigree, I'm willing to try more episodes.",Negative
"Not much here to make me want to see a second episode EXCEPT for Bebe's musical number right at the end.  A good pilot has to make you want more and this didn't much do that.  The novelty of the web is at least 15 years too late.  The singing has of course been done.  The interns were flat stereotypes.  Bebe's character (think Cruela Deville with an R rating) was the only thing that popped, and even that was more a new COMBINATION than something actually original.  Better than ""Onion News Empire"" pilot but that ain't sayin' much.Add this one to the scrap heap of history.",Negative
"A cop story in part of the country I am unfamiliar with...keeps my interest up...Twists and turns of the County's character and the wonder about how the Marshal's love life will end up is another thing that keeps me coming back for more,,,Perhaps a bit too much killing  so it may not be best for the young set.....A great adult show...",Positive
Fun silly and mindless entertainment. The kids are awesome dancers and Abby actually blows me away by her creative mind...totally a great series that keeps you entertained!,Positive
"By the end of this second season opener, we know the basic reason the older Alex sent a message to his younger self, and has arranged at least some of the events we saw in the first season.Judging by this episode, it looks like this season will be even better than the first.",Positive
I gave this rating due to how well the TV show is setup and how in real life there are police officers that would do the same things if not worse. I recommend checking it out if you are in to law TV series.,Positive
"My introduction to this series belongs to my son and his children (6 year old girl and 4 year old boy). These children have 'limited' tablet time so there are options that are 'parent approved.' The choice is theirs. Visiting with me means that we choose what to do together. With Amazon Prime, there is an excellent selection. We've watched most of the 'Rabbit Ears' productions and the Gnome episodes. This has become their viewing choice and I can understand why. The information is accurate and presented in a way that is both fun and educational. Definitely recommended!",Positive
This is on par with NCIS in my opinion. The acting is very good and the plots interesting.I do hope they keep the show for another season.,Positive
"It's a twist on the normal show about creatures of the night, they make you wish you were one of their friends. Keep your eyes open, watch how the d&eacute;cor of the house changes. You may not leave the house for a few days, hard to turn the T.V. off.",Positive
"It's okay nothing special. I am not really a fan of this show, to be honest I mainly ordered this episode to watch the end of the two part Hawaii five O  cross over. It was imo the weaker half. I wanted to like it - I really did. I like LL Cool J I enjoy most of his acting work. (I give him mad love for Toys) but this show is boring and the character just don't have the charisma that the original series has.",Negative
I enjoy Chopped because they use foodstuffs that I have never seen nor heard of and I find it interesting to find out how they are used in dishes.  I find the judges condescending and the contestants can't stop trying to sound needy.  I concentrate on the food.,Negative
So far too much of the focus has been on a young girl held captive in a shelter and the tweaked out guy who is holding her captive.,Negative
"This seemed so ridiculous at first, but halfway through my husband and I were hooked even though we both agreed that intelligent people could not be fooled this long.  Also, we would never have friends like these folks in our lives.  They are too immoral.",Positive
"TV shows always seem to be an all or nothing proposition in Amazon reviews. If someone watches a show, they automatically feel that it is five star quality despite its limitations. If someone tries a show and doesn't like it, they generally relegate it to a one star status despite its good points. Don't believe it? Go to the reviews of any program you absolutely hate and look at the glowing five star reviews from its fans. In truth, most shows fall somewhere in between--not every show you watch should automatically be considered as great entertainment and not every show you dislike merits a dismissive one star. I bring this up with NBC's short lived ""The Cape"" for one reason--I have only heard the show described as terrific or as terrible with very little middle ground. Personally, I think the show is neither terrific nor terrible but falls into the TV netherworld of a show with potential that never really fulfilled its promise.Capitalizing on the notion that every story with comic book origins deserves a Hollywood treatment (in itself, a specious idea), ""The Cape"" was introduced to capture the audience left when the increasingly problematic ""Heroes"" left the air. But lacking that show's complex mythology and appealing cast, it was an uphill battle from the start. I do contend that the elements to have developed a successful show were all present, they were just never assembled in the right way.The Good: David Lyons was a likable lead--a family man and cop who is forced into a heroic alter ego when framed (and seemingly murdered) by the town's super villain. James Frain has a nice menace as the unstable foe. Morally corrupt Keith David and a bevy of carnival performers provide unlikely support to our new hero. And sci-fi stalwart Summer Glau is on hand as the altruistic, and completely underdeveloped, Orwell. And best of all--Vinnie Jones!The Bad: The show never loses interest in Lyons' wife and child. And, I'm sorry, they just aren't compelling characters. The show's momentum grinds to an absolute halt every time they appear. Excruciating.The Frustrating: I don't think the show ever determined what it wanted to do and is tonally all over the place. Veering from maudlin to comedic from one moment to the next does little to shore up the inconsistencies in the show. Frain, Glau, and David all have great potential--but none are given fully developed plot lines. There is simultaneously too much going on and not enough--there needed to be more focus on the elements that worked. There needed to be more emphasis on the bigger good versus evil concept as opposed to lesser stand alone episodes.With so many choices in this overcrowded genre, I don't know that ""The Cape"" rates particularly highly. But it is far from unwatchable and its cast is game. A show I wanted to like more than I did, it still boasts nice production values and a laugh or two--but never gelled to one cohesive vision. KGHarris, 4/11.",Negative
Interesting and funny with a bit of thoughtfulness. It seems like a good reflection on human behavior while staying lite and funny,Positive
I have only watched three epeisodes but have loved every minute! The historical based drama has me hooked. I look forward to seeing more of the characters and their development. The account of British medicine and its development is fascinating.,Positive
My boys love Diego. This was a fun season with some Holiday Episodes included. Perfect timing with Halloween and Christmas just around the corner.,Positive
I know that hoarders are suffering from a mental illness and I can't imagine how awful it must be.  My guilty secret is I feel better about my house cleaning after watching Hoarders.  May not be nice but it is what it is.,Positive
I love this show so much that I would watch it every night if it were possible. truly brilliant plots.,Positive
"I had such high hopes with this team and cast (who were all very good). But it's just beyond boring. I couldn't finish it. I might try again as this idea could be ripe with smart humor, but right now, it's not. What a shame.",Negative
"My big problem with this film is that it simply does not flow. It's like a composition that meanders all over the place and does not fully explore any thesis. Characters do things which one simply wouldn't do in real life. If I was a graduate student at Oxford, I surely wouldn't drop the ""F"" bomb on a Don whom I want to become my mentor. Romantic relationships appear ""out of the blue."" Some characters disappear into thin air and the plot is so disjointed that I felt the whole thing was a waste of time. It's a pity because the trailer looked good and Lenora Watling is certainly easy to look at, but Elijah Wood is just plain HORRIBLE and quite frankly, other than her looks, Ms. Watling doesn't impress much either. Hurt spends his time pontificating and the whole thing is a jumble. Don't bother with it.",Negative
I kind of lived this life so I hated this movie although I like Richard Gere.  Reminded me too much of the arrogance and selfishness of this kind of man and of the woman willing to go along with it.,Negative
"There's not a lot to say since we are just three episodes into the fifth (and last) season of The Fringe. However, the series has never failed to satisfy. Having to wrap up story lines with the impending demise of the series may mean that early fifth season episodes are a bit enigmatib, but I'm sticking with the season and the storyline, confident that all will be revealed and we have some excellent surprises in store.",Positive
The story is interesting and true to the period. The cinematography is absolutely mesmerizing. Watching this series is more like watching a feature film on the big screen. I can't wait for Season 3!!!,Positive
This show is fun and is interesting to see how many expensive furnishings can be approximated for much less money.,Positive
"As a former veteran I had a lot of fun in the military.  Doing your duty was a matter of course and I had very good commanding officers and seargeants who once they became confident that you took your duties seriously really looked out for you.  The best became like a second father.Plus they have some funny lines.  I like bringing the family issues into this show.  For most of our professional military men and women, the military does become like a family.  I think that is one reason NCIS is so popular.The writers should be careful not to get too silly.  Even though this is a rear detachment, these people are still in harms way.",Positive
"IT'S SEEMS SO REAL . GET SCRIPS , GREAT ACTING. LOVE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER. THANK YOU.",Positive
What a complete farce. A very dark cinema of murder and mayhem. It stops there!!I wasted my money and paid a premium to see it 'before it is in the theatres'I do not give this even a star. As  a matter of fact it rates a minus 5 for me,Negative
Another fantastic season with plenty of twists and sub plots to keep you on the edge of your seat. Wife and I love to sit down and watch this season and the previous seasons even though we have already seen the episodes multiple times. Great storyline with plenty of character development.,Positive
I am a long time fan of mideval period movies. Vikings is in keeping with the warrior spirit of the period along with how men related to women and how both looked upon looting and enriching themselves. Survival of the fittest realistic representation of the characters.,Positive
I'm only watching this series because I've run out of other things to watch. I'm so tired of seeing women who chase bad guys in 3&#34; heels! The intro to the show with the motorcycle is just silly. It's ok but not great.,Negative

"Since I have never thought premium cable worth the money, I am pleasantly surprised to find this on Amazon Instant Video. While I have had to pay for all episodes of the four seasons, it's been a good value for me.I love having a show that is less than an hour, because I need my sleep!I had low expectations, because I figured that if I'd never heard of it, it wasn't very popular.I was wrong. My Roku together with my Amazon Prime membership has added great value to my life :)",Positive
"Love the show. I can see myself in different characters, family and friends in others.  The family dynamic is great in this show.  Faith, Family, and ducks, gotta love it.",Positive

"British television seems to churn out these mystery standards. Some are better than others (&#34;Vera&#34; is terrific), but nearly all are worth watching. And they get such wonderful actors involved: Ciaran Hinds is a delight.",Positive
Show is like an addictive drug. Once you start watching Saving Grace you will not be able to stop watching.,Positive
"If you like Vikings - many of the historical aspects, the realism, the sets and costumes and weapons are wonderful to see.  Then it devolves into a sort of soap opera-ish storyline and gets a little disappointing.  The  aspects of Viking culture that come through and concepts of Viking Myth and their Gods continue to be satisfying.  But I started to stop caring about many of the characters as the shows went on.  Good.  But not Great!",Negative
I really loved this show.It was packed full of different kinds of action and kept you wondering what was going to happen next. Can't wait till the next one comes out. I will deffinetly watch any further shows that  come on.,Positive

"OK, so what if Vegas was NEVER uncomplicated or simple.  It was certainly less crowded.Dennis Quaid shines as &#34;Man's Man, good-old-boy Rancher turned Sheriff&#34; Ralph Lamb.Jason O'Mara is fun to watch getting in and out of trouble as Jack Lamb, Ralph's younger brother who serves as his deputy.  (Who knew the love of a woman could be so painfully complicated and difficult?)Speaking about difficult love, Sarah Jones was well cast as Mia Rizzo (the light of Jack's life), too bad she's also responsible for skimming Savoy funds for the Mob.Nobody does bad like genuinely nice guy Michael Chiklis, who seems to have a great deal of fun playing Vincent Savino.  You just know he and lamb are eventually going to form some sort of alliance.As Dixon Lamb, Ralph's son, Taylor Handley has his moments, but sort of falls short of the mark.  Then again a lot of Vegas sort'a kind'a falls short of the mark.Perhaps one too many clich&eacute;s ... ever cheery mob boss Savino with a heart of gold ... mafia princess Mia with a heart of gold who's psycho mafia Dad (played to the hilt by character actor Michael Wiseman) tries to kill his daughter's cop boyfriend James, with fists, guns, cattle prods and more ... lascivious movie mogul played by Peter Jacobson of &#34;Starter Wife&#34; fame.  I could go on and on and on ... but you get the drift.  Vegas tries too hard, with a LOT of really good actors, but unfortunately falls way too short in the process.At the end of the season we're left wondering what's going to happen to Porter Gainsley (played by consummate villain actor Michael Ironside).  Sadly for the show, Gainsley has been turned into the redneck equivalent of an unstoppable sociopath terminator robot out for EVERYONE's blood.Evil Gainsley enjoys killing people ... a LOT.  He killed Lamb's wife, put Lamb's sort'a kind'a girlfriend, DA Katherine O'Connell (played by Carrie-Anne Moss, you'll remember her as Trinity in The Matrix) in a coma.  It doesn't pay to get too close or too attached to sheriff Lamb ... or any other of the Lamb brothers ... while Gainsley or the Mob's around.  Oh wait, sheriff Lamb and Selvino are working together to take down Gainsley.  Anyone else getting a headache?Don't get me wrong, I love the show and am sad it's been canceled, because it's always had a lot of potential.  Unfortunately the ratings haven't been great, but then that's an other story.Internet based TV numbers aren't counted as ratings, so good programs die, because only live ratings counts.  Which leaves us with programs like &#34;The Voice&#34;, &#34;American Idol&#34; and &#34;Dancing with the Stars&#34; (shudder).",Positive
"I consider this movie to be a the &#34;B&#34; category. The plot was somewhat interesting, but not the best script evere.",Negative
"This show is hiiiilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will leave you laughing out loud. Even if you don't watch football or participate in online football leagues, you will be able to follow along and appreciate the humor of this show.",Positive
The best ensemble of actors in a cop drama.  Love Andy Sipowicz.  Television has never been the same since NYPD is longer on TV.,Positive
Best action/drama series of all time. This show belongs in the same catogory as the Sopranos. Anyone who waste time watching tv needs to watch this show from beginning to end. The ending is epic and everything in between.,Positive
"A well done series which is typical of HBO. Drama, action, adventure, sex, violence, and a little history to boot what's not like.",Positive
"Unlikely plot, single lonely astronaut. Looks pretty, makes no sense.",Negative
"A big surprise.  And a pleasant one as the software development world mingles with the business world, baffling the techies and providing the backdrop for a number of very interesting personal stories from a very good cast of actors.  Worth a look.",Positive
"Very funny, first-rate British comedy.  Very verbal humor that you have to pay attention to.  As a fan of Steve Coogan and Colm Meaney, I wasn't disappointed.",Positive
Granddaughter watches this and never get bored. She well watch it over and over I can hardly get her to play with toys.,Positive
Outstanding detective and police series one of Masterpiece's best up to date stories. Sorry to see there is only one Season left.,Positive
"This show remains fresh and interesting. In fact the people here are interesting and you can't help but root for them. Even for the obnoxious scott who finally realized he had to go to detox. That wasn't scripted, nor are many of the actual dives, and things like the christine rose having trouble getting back to port. Some of the relationship stuff may be scripted , I don't know. But someone dying on the show isn't and the show remains one of my favorites and I don't watch lots of reality shows. this one has a basic truth to it as they look for gold and that's more than can be said for some of the completely scripted (sorta reality)  shows like the repo ones. (which are outreageous fun to be sure but you know it's not real and it eeen says so) this is a solid show and even the loopy steve who always shoots himself in the foot with his lazy episodes , he works hard on some eps then not so hard on others but he is a engaging person and you can see that he's a really  nice guy. I hope they don't lose him next season. Although someone needs to push him harder on the dives for sure.  See? this show engages you and it makes these people worth watching. For instance:  We want emily to overcome her fear of diving because she just can't stay around for ever that way, now that may be scripted , but maybe not. However much of this show is scripted there's a huge part of it that rings true enoough to be worth your time watching it. and sadly one castmember even dies in it. another decent person , which all adds up to good viewing at a high cost.",Positive
"Man this grabbed me by the short hairs and obviously the story line required a great deal of thought and preparation.  At first glance it is symbolic, then metaphor, analogy or allegory about a life spent in futility, living a frustrated artists' temperament in the midst of conformity and mindlessness!",Positive
This could be a very good and enjoyable show. My daughter liked it. I would like to see a full live action episode though.,Negative
"My daughter likes to watch cartoons, but many of them are so violent and show how to be disrespectful to others.  many of them hark back to RoadRunner/Wiley Coyote  days..where the protagonist just keeps on trying to kill the character...using various methods.This series is an amazing relief from those animated series.  The plot is intriguing and the characters believable.  The animation is very good, although not on par with Disney...I don't care about that part.  My 9-year-old daughter loves this series and I make sure I watch it with her.  And I enjoy it, too!",Positive
Enjoyed the series. I have watched the series more than once.  Enjoy both Henry Winkler and Stockard Channing.  Amusing comedy.,Positive
I can hardly wait until next season!  I love the premise and the actors are doing a wonderful job with their characters.  I especially like Rachel and Donna!  Keep these fine dramas coming!,Positive
"A bad episode of HIMYM is like a good episode of any other show. in other words, it's AMAZE-balls. I never turn it off because it's good medicine: laughter & stress relief.This show is my wrinkle cream (it pumps blood to my face and increases circulation to my wrinkles, slowing the aging process. Also, cranky people age faster: this is my scientific and medically sound theory). A few laugh lines are okay in exchange for general skin dewiness. Added Value: I'm less of a total behotch after I &#34;watch my show&#34; as the old people say. Everybody wins!Wow, does Ted sleep with a lot of women. I hope he is covered in a hazmat latex bodysuit with um, many spermicid-y chemicals.",Positive
This year is trying to top last year and they are exceeding. Each episode is excellent especially the farewell episode to Amy and Rory.,Positive
"I have not read the books this was based on but it sure sounds good.  Not sure if they will follow a story from the books but the one started by the pilot was pretty good..  Pretty good track record with the people involved and the actors included..  Having The Wire's Eric Overmeyer as a writer and producer immediately made me pay attention and it was worth it!!  Of the 2 pilot dramas, this was the most mainstream..",Positive
My grandchildren kept telling me about the Doctor Who and I decided to see what all the hub bub was about.  Have found that I enjoy the adventures of the Doctor and Rose.,Positive
"After a week off, Dollhouse returned with ""Haunted,"" another wonderful, high-octane episode that brings a completely new dimension to the concept behind the series. This brings up even more ethical questions about the Dollhouse that I've never thought of before, and makes the viewer think a little bit harder about characters in the show.After Adelle's wealthy friend, Margaret, dies, she imprints the woman's memories into Echo allowing her, in a sense, to have a kind of life after death. Adelle and Echo/Margaret attend the woman's funeral, since she wonders just how many people actually loved her when she was alive. After some unexpected happenings at the funeral, Margaret decides that she wants to find out who killed her.Past this point the viewers are thrown into a surprising original twist on the age-old ""whodunnit"" murder mystery (complete with typical line-up of suspects, all this motives). I thought this was a fresh and much welcome departure from the rest of the series and allowed Dollhouse to add a little mystery into the mix. The entire plot was perfectly put together and filled with intense surprises that kept me guessing up until the very end.The story's unique approach also forces viewers to think a little harder about what kind of world they will leave behind after they die. Are their relationships and lives just as they imagine them to be, or are there some sinister secrets lurking underneath it all?Back at the Dollhouse, it's time for Topher annual ""diagnostic test."" The purpose behind this isn't really explained, but it results in Topher imprinting Sierra with a personality that makes her the perfect nerd-friend for him, complete with knowledge of MMORPGs, laser tag, Xbox 360 and science-y stuff. While these scenes are absolutely hilarious and feature great dialogue, they are serve as a kind of window into Topher's character -and just how lonely he is.Topher's not the only lonely one. Agent Bellard is feeling lonelier by the minute as he wrestles with the truth of Mellie's identity. As Bellard pushes closer to the Dollhouse, he makes a believer in the FBI office after the two try to investigate Mellie's past.In the end the mystery of Margaret's death comes to a satisfying conclusion, despite the unbelievable idea that Margaret willingly gives up her stay in Echo's body and potential eternal life. However, I can easily overlook this detail after the rest of ""Haunted"" kept me guessing the entire time.Sadly, there are strong rumors going around that Dollhouse is going to be canceled after the first season -just like Fox cancels all of its good shows. I've also read online that Fox will not air the final episode of the season, but Joss and co. are planning to include it on the DVD.",Positive
awesome i liked all of the actors in this series. I wish they had continued this show for many for years than it aired.  Maybe they can bring it back.,Positive
This film is a crime drama with a bit of supernatural and horror thrown in. Acting and cinematography is pretty good and the crime story isn't bad.,Negative
"I learned some, but not much. Did not even show the crown jewels in the episode on the Queen's possessions.",Negative
Good Tv show. I enjoyed watching it. Looks a lot like actuality. I would watch it again. Give it a four star.,Positive
Hannibal is great not because of Hannibal himself but because of Will Graham.  Will is delightfully arcane and peculiar as he searches for the killer.  His morality is absolute.  He will kill the killer if that is what it takes.  I love this show.,Positive
"I had my doubts when I read the description - but my husband and I both really enjoyed it!  As the daughter of a classical musician - this was fun!  I love the idea of seeing the grit, creativity, and playful nature of musicians!  As far as I know there aren't any other shows out there of this genre - it could be a hit!",Positive
"A fairly routine horror entry but with a story you've seen a hundred times. However in spite of the insipid plot, this one manages a few creepy moments that almost make it worthwhile to watch.",Negative
"Loved the cast especially John Goodman,but the premise of four senators living together was totally unbelievable.Still looking for the comedy and had a hard time finding it.",Negative
I chose this rating because this is one of my favorite shows. I am a huge fan of Grimm. I like the stories and cast. I have been a fan of Grimm since Season one. I would recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of fairy tale type shows. The creators of the series has done a great job blending the fairy tales into each episode. I look forward to the rest of Grimm Season three.,Positive
"Love this show and all other Anthony Bourdain Shows as well. Shame on Amazon with me being a paid Prime customer to be notified of the price increase and go and turn on my prime watchlist to find that none of my shows are Prime eligible anymore!!! Just a little over a week later! Now...why am I going to pay more to pay again? NOT GOOD AMAZON! NOT GOOD AT ALL OF YOUso if you are willing to pay twice, this show is definitely well worth it",Positive
A different kind of a movie. The story unfolds a little more with each episode. I will watch season two.,Positive
My grandson loves the Backyardigans.  He sings the songs and dances around while watching.  I enjoy watching the episodes with him as they are very entertaining.,Positive
"By far my favorite season so far.. Tennant is my favorite Doctor, and i love the relationship he has with Rose.",Positive
"I bought this first season on blu-ray because my 22 year old son wanted to watch it during the holiday break and he loved it.  I DVR this first season and binged watched it and I knew my son would love it.  Great acting, direction and filmed on location in Ireland!  We are all looking forward to Season 2.  Highly recommend.",Positive
"The following is taken from the comments I made on the survey. &#34;Mozart&#34; was a huge disappointment on all fronts except for Malcolm McDowell and even this script is far from being suited for his best work. I had hoped for some good music and some drama and received only a lousy plot, bad acting and a show that tried to combine HBO drama and Cinemax, almost creepy, sex rolled into one.",Negative
"2013NR: Just over the top enough to pull off the drunkard Irish stereotype without offending. I mean if you think about it, who wouldn't drink while in a country surrounded by water, that has some of the finest firewater in the world, and with creepy-crawling alcohol-allergic monsters chasing them? LOL  Definitely 'fun' and occasionally funny. Enjoy MFJLabs 3x",Negative
"'Better Off Ted' is an excellent example of programs that don't develop a fan base until its too late. The writing and acting are excellent. Portia de Rossi is spot-on as the corporate suit with no empathy or moral compass, Jonathan Slavin and Malcolm Barrett are hilarious as the lab geeks with zero social skills, and Jay Harrington is perfect as the buffer between them. If you haven't seen it yet, take the time to watch both seasons. You'll be glad you did.",Positive
"I am glad I bought the DVD's so in a year or so I can watch it again.  When Survivor goes off the air, hopefully never, but if and when they do, I have backups for my Survivor withdrawal.",Positive
Love the DVD set and beautiful packaging.  I love this series and have bought the entire series available.  Received set when promised.,Positive
"The main premise of this show appears to take the actor with the least screen time or interaction with the star and make them the guilty party. A 1970's novel style that quickly annoyed people by having them read several hundred pages before introducing the killer on the next to last page. The main character is likable and the relationship with the nurse is oft-times weird and disjointed, but the supporting cast makes up for the obvious flaws and inconsistencies that abound and annoy. I've been binge watching it and do find myself checking the time, playing Frost, or looking up baseball scores while it's on, so take it for what it's worth. I guess its better than network TV, but not by much.",Negative
The show had some great parts but it wasn't grand slam. I would love to see it get picked up and worked on. With the talent and cast the show should have a really good chance at finding a funny rhythm.,Positive
Missed opportunity to be really good. I always like to learn something about the inside of an industry when I watch something like this. Nothing presented itself. The concept was good but the delivery was pretty yoki.,Negative
"If it has Jane Austen's name on it, we have to see it. She depicts life as it was with such accuracy that it reminds us how fortunate we are not to be living then, even as aristocrats, life was so narrow. However, she laces reality with a generous dose of humor to help us tolerate narrow minds, the lack of choice of a life well chosen even among the wealthy, such strict guidelines of class that are so abominable when viewed from today's stance.She portrays her characters with the genius of insight that makes us love them and hate them, tolerate them and want to lose them in the nearest swamp, but all the time learning what life was for those who did live and love during that time. I only wish she had written even more works for us to learn and ponder...and wonder.",Positive
"I give this four stars for fans of low budget films set in the Far East, and three for those who are looking for typical action adventure fare. The appeal of this, of course, is Kellan Lutz. I thought he did a decent job, but i was more taken with the real sense of place the film has. You almost smell the sweat of the people living in poverty in the world depicted by the film. Mickey Rourke plays his typical eccentric bad guy role, losing his accent from time to time.",Positive
"I got this movie the same day Paul Walker died.  Based on the storyline (depressing enough), I waited to watch it.  The movie is expectedly a tear jerker, but it is a pretty good movie.  Glad I bought it, but won't watch it often",Positive
Excellent acting and storyline !!! Wish it would have been renewed. I loved this T.V. show. It kept me on edge.,Positive
It's a funny cartoon and nothing like its predecessor. My 7 y/o laughs non stop. A little expensive per episode unfortunately.,Positive
I like watching the cooking challenges since they use foods that I have never seen or heard of. The iron chefs seem to win more than the challengers but it is still interesting.,Positive
"The best part of this robotically acted, go nowhere storyline was the use of black & white filming. (That's suppose to be a funny.)Of all the ways to juxtapose going to Disney when you're a kid and then again as an adult w/kids this was not well executed. For some reason Dad is just as interested in gawking at two 14 year old girls (who tease him on) and who seem to always show up in the scenes (on rides, standing in line, eating, etc.) and was tediously boring.",Negative
"Best show ever, after Burn Notice can't have enough of it. Season 2 here I come, thanks to Amazon instant!",Positive
"Always looking for new, good, free entertainment. This Amazon production is top quality. Now I am anxious to find out when the series continues.",Positive
Not as funny as the other seasons. Still funny and follows the theme but perhaps it's one too many seasons. I understand that it's difficult to write the shows. They did an excellent job overall.,Negative
"The acting was fine, and it was well shot, but it was very VERY slow and there were no laughs. I didn't care about the characters or what they were doing. If it gets picked up, I am not going to be watching. Not worth free.",Negative
"I enjoyed it and would def like to see more. John Gudman makes it very funny, hope this show gets picked up.",Positive
"Elementary is just another spin on the &#34;genius detective&#34; genre of crime shows. The show tries to be a little different by placing Sherlock Holmes in modern day New York, making him a recovering drug addict, and turning Watson into a woman played by Lucy Liu. If you suspend your disbelief an accept the premise, the show is okay. The BBC's does a better updated Holmes with its show &#34;Sherlock&#34;",Negative
This show has tension and excitement and is oddly engaging.  I watched because family members enjoyed it so much.  Didn't expect to like it but now I am hooked.  It moves quickly but the camera takes the time to show the food preparation.  I like that the cooks talk among themselves while awaiting the judges decision.,Positive
"Watching the series is sooooooooooo sad. Watching the family talk about their love ones not knowing where they are and what happen to them. You want there to be a happy ending but unfortunately in most cases it's not, I like the show and it's a good show but very sad to see. Would recommend.",Positive
"It looks like some of the footage is very poor standard definition quality (like bad cell phone video quality) spliced into other footage that is HD. Some of the worst video quality I have seen on Amazon. However, the content is great and it represents the parks really well. Lots of interesting information.",Negative
Makes you more understand what determines our feelings. Some things you may already know. Many of the things I could identify with.,Positive
"I LOVE the original Cosmos that Carl Sagan did back when everyone was wearing socks with stripes on the top. Neil Tyson is Sagan's spiritual successor, as far as I and many others are concerned, so there's really no one else on the whole planet better suited to do this show. The content itself is beyond reproach. Tyson is the perfect lecturer, the content mirrors the original to some extent, and the CGI is very, very good. It's only been one episode, but I can tell they put some serious effort into it.Fox, there is a PERFECT way to do house ads in paid content. PUT THEM AFTER OR DURING THE CREDITS!!! That way, they will still be seen, but they will not interrupt the user experience with the same loud offensive schlock that is DRIVING US AWAY FROM TELEVISION IN THE FIRST PLACE.",Negative
Never heard of it and watch the whole thing in one nightDid not go to sleepcould not quite watching gave a great message,Positive
"Great series. I didn't expect it to be based on comics, but so far I like the series a lot. I can't wait to see the first episode of Season 2.",Positive
fun entertaining episodes. this doctor is very good and energetic compared to other doctors. great way to pass the time,Positive
"""Blue Caprice"" is a docu-drama about the DC sniper. It starts with a teen boy in the Caribbean and goes from there. He meets up in the US with his paranoid father/uncle/guy who has a grudge against the system that separates him from his children. He uses the boy to enact revenge.The film doesn't have a lot of action. It is mostly a drama, a means to provide some closure for those who ask ""why?"" The killing scenes are not overly graphic and in many cases they jump over them as well as skip scenes such as the actual arrest and taking them into custody.The acting was good although Lee (Tequan Richmond) didn't have a lot of lines and seemed to have lost his island accent by the end of the film. I found the film interesting as a biography of the killers, but overall lacking in shear entertainment value. The title is clever when you think about it literally (blue=sad, caprice=impulsive) and not a car.Parental Guidance: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",Negative
"You need to pay close attention when watching this one.  The scenario is quite plausible.  In 2010, Britain eliminated its voluntary national ID card system.  This 5-part series postulates an alternative which cannot be as easily discarded.",Positive
"In this series, I've found two of my favorite things - British crime stories & the acting talent of Helen Mirren.  Add to that the constant battle for respect by a woman in a traditionally &#34;men's club&#34; position of authority.  The story lines are realistic & DI Tennison tenaciously tracks down the murderer, in spite of her superiors, uncooperative subordinates & personal issues.Overall, this series is exceptionally well done.",Positive
"I watched some of this series when it was on TV, but it fell behind my list of other great drama series, mostly because there are so many out there. But, what stood out about this series is that it is beautifully shot and there is great care and attention by the creators when it comes to story and aesthetic. Re-watching this series from the beginning has been a rewarding surprise and I find myself wondering why this hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. Especially in a Network environment where anything that is different is as good as canceled. There are familiar cop procedural tropes, I will admit. But, this series deserves your respect for its bravery, and more importantly, it deserves your EYEBALLS! I think you will be pleased if you decide to watch it and do so before season 2 premieres at the end of February 2014! The only way these kinds of series stay alive is if you watch them! Enjoy. - Just a Fan",Positive
"Great series, although, by season 4, the story becomes too complicated and at times, unbelievable.  Really liked the mix of characters.  Totally unlike the Battlestar Galactica of the 1980s.",Negative
This season starts with more questions than answers and it starts a bit slow and at least two episodes in the show i would say are pure filler however the rest are amazing since u can see that the human losses are taking there toll on our heroes. Still the ending leaves you with a sense that there is hope even in our darkest hours if we are strong and brave enough to find it.,Positive
Simple and entertaining. New love for the octopus. My dd has &#34;learned&#34; a new love for the sea. Recommend it,Positive
"Nothing new here. It's a parody of Noir, but with nothing innovative. If you have absolutely nothing else to watch, then go for it.",Negative
"It's a bit early for a conclusive review, but if the rest of this show holds up as well as the first two episodes, this will be a real winner.  I was so drawn in after the first episode (thanks Amazon for the free download) that I just had to keep watching to see where the show would go.  I'm intrigued by the slightly contemporary setting, it makes things more interesting and doesn't detract from the show at all.  Can't wait for more.",Positive
"I have loved shark week since the 80's when I was a kid in school! It has helped in some ways not to fear them as in the movie Jaws! They are deadly, strong, determined. So are people psychos and such but we must live our lives with this knowledge racing through our minds and souls! This episode I hadn't seen! It was well pieced together to make an interesting story and to care for the attacked or (accident). I am only repeating the (excuse me sir)what Mr. Mark R. says we should call them! I think he needs to be put away somewhere safe. I decided to watch it again and realized this is his passion who am I to criticize that! We should all be so lucky to feel that way! Looking at his leg really has me shaking my head how remains steadfast. If it weren't for the hundreds of people who have produced decades of shark weeks we would never know about this brave man and the others. Also ask me anything about sharks I would get an A plus in marine biology! :) thanks",Positive
"Arbitrage(released Jan/12) stars,among others,Richard Gere as Robert Miller,Susan Sarandon as Ellen Miller,Tim Roth as Det.Bryer,Brit Marling as Brooke Miller,Laetitia Casta as Julie Cote,Nate Parker as Jimmy Grant,Stuart Margolin as Syd Felder,and Chris Eigeman as Gavin Briar.Yes,the name says it all,the title meaning taking advantage of a disparity in markets and reaping profits,ideally,with zero cost.And the film is all business too,with all the actors here turning in a very good performance.The story finds Gere as the head of a large corporation.Things seem perfect in his world,with a lovely wife,daughter and a thriving business.Slowly we learn things are not all that rosy.He invested heavily in a copper mine in Russia and at first things were rolling along tremendously.Later the countrie`s export rules changed and Gere was left holding the bag and had to fork out millions he didn`t readily have.He took from his own investors to plug the financial gap in the books;taking from Paul to pay Peter.In the end it still left a $400,000,000 gap that he plugged with a friends money.However now the friend is calling in his loan just before a rival company is about to possibly buy Gere`s company,which would close the gap.One night he visits the gallery of a young French girl who is a budding artist,who he bankrolls and has had an ongoing affair with for some time.They take a ride out to a place of his outside of NYC that he owns.On the way he briefly falls asleep and the car flips over several times.His amour is dead and he is devastated and panicking.He makes a phone call to a young man.His father,who used to work for him,and asked Gere,when he passed away,to keep an eye on as he grew up.He asks him to come and fetch him and take him home.On the way to make the call the car Gere had been driving blows up.Gere arrives home and disposes of the security camera evidence in his apartment and burns his shirt which had blood on it.As the movie progresses the heat gets turned up ever slower,whether it is the police sniffing around Gere,and/or the police putting the heat on the young man.Also the man responsible for wanting to buy his firm keeps putting his offer off,while he keeps sending underlings to negotiate for him,which stresses Gere ever more.Adding fuel to this ever growing out of control fire,is Gere`s daughter who is his chief accountant.She has discovered the gap in funds and is pressuring him to come clean on the reasoning behind it.Working for Gere is his lawyer,who is pulling every trick out of his hat he can for Gere.He has obtained an excellent lawyer for the young man who picked him up that fateful night,and who now the police are attempting to indict.Gere also is forced to tell his daughter the truth about the gap in funds and she is devastated that he not only hid it from her but that she could also lose her license.The two don`t part on friendly terms.At the height of all the heat,Gere is finally able to have a tete a`tete with the man who has been offering to buy his company.Gere gambles by coming on strong and gets his asking price and a signed deal on the spot.That is one major hole plugged.Then it is discovered some crucial evidence in the case against his young driver has been falsified and the case is summarily dismissed.Just as everything was set to blow up in his face,everything now starts to deflate and Gere,his finances and employees are all saved from disgrace.However there remains one last cog to be fixed....his wife.She confronts Gere and knows he wasn`t telling the truth about that fateful night and she also knew about the affair with the girl who died.For silence she wants him to turn over a major charity event`s holdings to her.He balks but in the end,if he wants his freedom,he will and he does.The film ends as Gere is attending his charity function to receive an award,with his daughter doing the intro and saying all the right things,with his ``loving`` wife by his side.As he stands ready to speak....fade to black.An excellent spot to stop the film on.This plot may seem like a variation on a theme,with yet another inside look at big business,how they operate,how corrupt they can be and how they wield their power.Goodness knows there has been enough of those types of films over the years.But this film has enough of a good plot,and some fine actors on board,to pull it off quite gracefully.I was surprised seeing ``Angel`` from the Rockford Files,Stuart Margolin,who turned in a very fine performance as Gere`s lawyer.There is a plot gap that,for me,was quite big.The police never did know the driver of the car that night,though they had their suspicions.Every car has a VIN(vehicle identification number)and even though the car caught on fire,it should still have been obtainable.They would have known right away who the owner of the car was through that.But that would have meant a shorter film,or a plot going in another direction than the writers wishes.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extra is some commentary.All in all a surprisingly good film and look at the head of a financially questionable company,who finds himself in trouble way over his head.Through a lot of string pulling and sheer luck he gets out from under it all.But at what cost.Recommended.",Positive
Best show on TV right now. Full of plot twists and plenty of squeamish moments. I can't get enough of it.,Positive
This did not disappoint. Can't wait to watch more. I love having a female star in the major role. Good to watch anytime.,Positive

"When I saw this movie was being made, I thought, wow...thats gonna be tough to make. Well, let me tell you, they did an awesome job of it! Of course all the book isn't in there...if this movie intrigues you, go read it for more insanity. Another thing that has me ecstatic is that they found the perfect director for it. Don Coscarelli started with Phantasm and has done pretty well since. This book perfectly captures his directorial style. If you are still reading this, stop, and watch the movie!(and don't forget ""This Book is Full of SPIDERS!"", Wong's sequel)",Positive
"Different from most TV and a great escape from the usual fare on TV. It is not plausible in any way,but that is a good thing.",Positive
love this show and have collected each season. sorry it had to end and all fans should add this final season to their collection,Positive
I couldn't even get all the way through it. I was not impressed at all. They should toss this one.,Negative

"FUTURE WARS is another reprehensible ""film"" atrocity that's seemingly custom-made for Mike and his bot friends to lampoon mercilessly. The unintelligible plot has something to do w/ wobbly, rubber dinosaurs, silly cyborgs, and a guy who runs around fighting them w/ karate. Robert Z'Dar (MANIAC COP 1-3) makes a painfully humiliating appearance as a bloated, lumbering cyborg! His scenes are almost too much to bear! The rest of this abysmal elephant turd is only watchable through MST3K-vision. Any attempts to view it otherwise could result in a slow, agonizing death...",Positive

"I was at Lighthouse Beach in Chatham on Cape Cod watching this on my Kindle.  Chatham is known for all of the Great Whites that show up every summer because of the high seal population.

"Ike finds himself enthralled by the Royal Candaian Weding, and stays home to watch it. This leads to a series of events in which he is unable to continue a play at school and where he needs to go to Canda. Kyle finds himself filling in for Ike and doing the play, but no one seems to be able to do anything right.This episode has been one of the better ones in a while, and I think that says a lot. In Season 14, I found myself a little bit on or off BUT here, in 15, everything seems to be going well. I personally like the detour to the little kids in this, and I like the Canadian storyline. It has something in it for everyone, plus it takes its shot at the Royal Wedding well in the televised comments.The VOD on this is pristine, making it worth watching. And this season has been great, and only gets better. I think a 5/5 is justly deserved, with me never wanting to have to scrape off pudding or deal with an arm like the Royals have to.",Positive
the job they do is unbelievable! soooo exciting. if you haven't seen it your in for a treat. watch it youll love it!,Positive
I'm really enjoying this series.  I wish I found it sooner than now.  It's an interesting perspective on what would happen if life changed as we know it.  Will we remain civil or go into anarchy?,Positive
"I really liked SG-1 and I liked Atlantis even more.  And after watching Atlantis for the second time I decided to go ahead and try to watch universe.  I agree it is somewhat like BG although honestly I loved that series.  This is almost work to watch.  It complicated and annoying and dark.  BG was dark too but it moved right along.  Atlantis was exciting and fun and almost campy.  I could watch it while I did other things and still enjoy it.  SGU demands my attention and when I waste time just watching it it's not fun at all.  I'll try to keep going but if they don't get off that ship soon I'll have to quit.  I'm up to episode ""Life"" and so far overall the series sucks.  Half way through the season, there is no one moment of joy so far.  I'm going to skip to the last episode of season one and then hope season 2 is better.",Negative

"I love period films , so this two part series based on a novel was perfect for me . The story takes place in France pre and post WWi and has romance and blood and guts and intertwining life stories .The film was well done .I did find that often words were somewhat mumbly to me because of the accents though spoken in English. Still worth watching.",Positive
"I didn't expect a whole lot from this show after reading the premise, but the comedy does not feel forced at all like many pilots do.  Watching pilots for a lot of shows that I like makes me realize that it takes time for actors to really settle into their roles and develop on-screen chemistry, but this pilot seems to have skipped the awkward stage all together and left me wishing I could click &#34;next episode&#34;.",Positive
"Athe show was pretty good the first couple of years, but the plots are overly convoluted to the point they are more and more absurd. The acting is decent, but the writers are trying to do too much with the cast. The evil forces tend to be one guy who is no longer in the CIA, but somehow can walz in and out of headquarters, even though everyone knows he's a cold bkooded killer and a double crosser. He could be killed- off at anytime by any number of agents he's wronged, but no one has done so. If nothing is on, this is a reasonable shoe to pass the time with.",Negative
"The first season was just interesting enough to keep me watching to see where the writers were going. The show fits a popular structure: smart guy with a quirk, problem, talent, works with a cute, beautiful, detective to help her solve crimes. Usually homicide. In this case the doc talks to people who are not there. He has a mental problem. He talks to these non-existing people and usually gets input from them that helps solve the case. Good enough for the first season and to rate a second season. The writers are now smart enough to kick it up a notch or two for the second season.Natalie, one of the Doc's regular hallucinations, appears as a real person. Only she is not Natalie, she is someone the Doc has seen for a brief moment a few years earlier. This becomes a couple of the best episodes in the series and does open doors to an interesting direction. The second season also introduces a new character: the cute cop lady's soon to be ex-husband. Definitely time to broaden the cast and this works. It gives the cute cop lady, who has been pretty bland so far, more to do and more interesting screen time. In the final episodes she finally gets away from just being the Doc's straight man and takes charge. In the second season an interesting series has become a good series.",Positive
I love to watch this show. It has good actors and a natural style plot. My wife even likes to watch this show with me.,Positive
This show has great potential and I really enjoyed the pilot. Hope to see more of this one in the future.,Positive
"Fantastic movie! Love the set-up... Romans vs Picts. Great action adventure movie. This one's up there with ""Agora"" as my favorite movie of the year. Don't buy many dvds anymore, but this one's a keeper. If you liked ""Dog Soldiers"" or ""The Descent"", you'll love this one. It's Mr. Marshall's best movie yet! Don't mind the other reviews that are middling to negative. This movie is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. Brisk pacing, fantastic fight scenes, great acting, sexy men, one beautiful woman, one evil woman and lovely landscapes, beautifully filmed. What more can a guy want in a escapist movie? Fully satisfied here.",Positive

"Dr. Peter Van Dorn (Greg Bayan) has developed a nirvana drug for the brain that he is testing on live subjects. The FDA has shut him down. Meanwhile there are weird murders going on in town and Peter's daughter (Elizabeth Shevock) is being bullied by a cheerleader (Sarah East). A dumb doughnut eating cop (Joe Hansard) is investigating the whole thing.The film has high camp value. The dialouge is far better than the delivery. Initially the movie uses camera angles so you don't see the killer, but after a few kills they show the killer which most of us have figured out. In an effort to cover up the bad acting, worse special effects are used.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Campy Sexual situations. Watch at your own risk.",Positive
"Season 2 featured a murder mystery based on copycat Kray twins.  I was only a little familiar with the Krays and later viewed a 1994 BBC documentary on youtube.  These episodes featured a lot of quick graphics that made the story very choppy.  Excellent acting.  The writing and direction, less so.",Negative
I think this is the funniest show on air currently.  Thumbs up for having a good cast that keeps it funny throughout the show.  Some shows are funny for example Melissa and Joey is funny but I don't think it keeps my laughing through the entire show the way Baby Dady does.I'm really hoping Danny and Riley get together and stay together.  I totally see it going there before this show goes off the air.  Her and Ben didn't work.,Positive
"This cartoon is so odd. It centers around a flock of sheep who get into all kinds of crazy shenanigans. There is barely any speaking (by humans or otherwise),  but it doesn't matter:  I am interested in each episode, start to finish. (And of course my three-year old is, too...) It's an entertaining show with an original concept. Highly recommended if you are looking for a laugh.",Positive
"Series gets high marks in intrigue, character development, and acting. The path of its story is believable, even plausible for 11episodes.  Then suddenly we are expected to believe that a handful of old, white males are controlling the fate of the free world by manipulating those who are sworn enemies to the &#34;west&#34;.  Soooo, the world we see in Rubicon is in sharp contrast to that we see depicted in &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; (supposedly true events set to drama). Either it takes exhaustive intelligence resources, years of analysis, and unexpected good fortune to finally make breakthrough in finding the most high-profile terrorist in the world-- or, as portrayed in &#34;Rubicon&#34;, the whole material world is controlled-not by an industry, or a conglomerate of industries- but a few conspirators. Such an outlandish assumption REQUIRES adequate explanation. Otherwise, the story is an insult to those fighting our battles- and their loved ones. No wonder this series stopped production when it did. The storytellers wound themselves up so tight in their own trap, there was no way to continue with anyone to follow.",Negative
"Not blown away, but there's potential for more. I don't hate any of the characters, though the roommate (Lizzie?) is a bit over the top for my taste. She annoyed the heck out of me. Other than that, a decent show so far.",Negative
"I was a fan of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly, so I had high hopes for this.Well, we've got lots of shots of scantily clad young women, no chemistry between characters, no endearing characters, and a story about a kidnapped and abused girl.  Nothing like delving into a parent's worst nightmare with characters we don't care about.  Oh well, that's that.",Negative
Stumbled into this movie after watching Hansel and Gretel. I thought Gretel is a great and sexy actress and wanted to check out other movies. She is definitely hot in this movie..the story and other actors are somewhat lame and it takes dedication to watch the movie to the end. Still great scenes with Gretel..reason for the 4 stars.,Positive

If nothing else we get to learn how to pronounce the season from Jeff.  I like the ability to learn of the country and culture of the area the survivors have entered.,Positive
"For the first time in a long time, saw and episode that I regretted paying for.  And that is a bad thing.  I gonna stick with this series for a while, but it's just not as layered and complex as it used to be.The brilliance of this show is its ability to address &#34;virtue&#34; on a very physical level.  I think they have of lost their way in this manner.",Negative
I was so disappointed that it came to an  end. I had invested time and interest in these characters and wanted to see more. I enjoyed watching the progeression of medicine in London during this period and comparing it to today's doctors and nurses.Would like more series in this vein.,Positive
I really enjoy this show and all the creative talent involved. I really think that they have recaptured the classic Zombie genre that has been so elusive as of late for other film makers.,Positive
I have a few shows on Amazon that I purchase every week this is one of them.  I love to watch them over and over.,Positive
"Because of my wife, I've been watching more mysteries than I probably would given my own devices. I've come to enjoy them more and am getting better at seeing the difference between decent ones and really good ones. This is north of decent but south of really good.Here's the scoop. Martin (Elijah Wood) travels to Oxford in the hopes of being sponsored by Arthur Seldom (John Hurt) for his doctoral thesis. The owner of the home at which he is staying is murdered and leads to other, seemingly clever, math based, murders. Martin and Arthur team up with inspector Peterson (Jim Carter) in the hopes of solving the equation and catching the killer.This, like all good mysteries, is very clever. But that one of the main components is high level math, I felt left out at various times. There are the various red herrings and love story on the side, but most of it involves very high level thinking and reasoning. When Martin and Arthur match wits on their deductions I struggled to keep up. Also, like many mysteries, the end is not the end. Yes the murders are solved but the mystery remains so there are a couple of post script scenes. And, as has been done in mysteries since time began, there is a long soliloquy in the final scene tying everything together. Don't blink during this scene.I've only seen one other film by director Alex de la Iglesia but I liked it a lot. This is all very professional with a good cast and good production values. Enjoy it. Try to keep up and take it as it is. It's enjoyable but it probably won't make your top mystery 5.",Positive

"My son and I are fans of Paranormal Witness.  It is a very interesting show.  Actors portray real life people in a situation from their life where they encountered paranormal activity such as ghosts, demons, haunting, possession.  The real life people talk about what happened to them and it goes back and forth from the witnesses to what they experienced as portrayed by actors.  The settings and film production are excellent.  It can scare the pants off of you to think such things exist or happened to someone.",Positive
Good clean and colorful fun for a four old.  I can always be sure that she will be entertained as she learns about the world she lives in.,Positive
Found this show when I was having Sherlock withdrawls. I really liked it but it obviously was cancelled since it was filmed in 2008 and says Season One. So take it for what it is and enjoy.,Positive
"This is another gold mining reality tv show. It gets three stars because its slightly better than most reality shows these days. Not great. But maybe a cut above. Its *less* fake than many other shows.A construction outfit from Alabama goes down to Guyana in South America to strike it rich gold mining. The people come across as mostly competent and authentic. And seeing what happens when they get put in a totally different situation from their normal work is mildly interesting. They also did mostly what they said they were going to do. There was the usual ""drama"" and maybe it seemed better just by comparision to other reality shows these days.The lesson at the end, as with all of these shows, is that gold mining is never easy and there isn't much money to be made by small-time operations. But all the same, it was good to see these people try to do something rather than sit around.",Negative
"This is a great series that engages you from the get-go.  It has an authentic feel and a really good historical story line.  It will also make you realize how lucky we are to live in a high-tech essentially democratic (still, despite corporate hegemony) nation with nifty stuff like antibiotics and painkillers, not to mention education.  Not to mention the internet.  Not to mention religious or lack-thereof tolerance.  While watching this series I frequently cringed at the religious fanaticism of the Brits and the unbelievably deeply entrenched superstition of the Vikings.  Witch hunts anyone?  Anyone?  No?  Okay, how about blood sacrifice?  No?  Then let's give thanks to the Universe for being born in a more enlightened age, with much room for improvement of course.",Positive

"I wasn't sure I would buy Welliver as Bosch, but I found that I enjoy his characterization very much. The casting on this episode was excellent, and the story very true to the book. I hope that you continue to produce this as a full series. I have long wanted to see the character of Bosch given a full treatment! It was a real treat, and I was pleasantly surprised.",Positive
"This season of Supernatural was fairly different from the others. While still carrying an episodic feel there was enough of all elements/characters recurring that it wasn't exactly the same as the first two. This season also started to mix in more light hearted hurmorous episodes among the darker and intense ones, which I didn't mind as I had grown to really like what humor had previously been shown.As for the additions of the female anti heroes, I actually grew to enjoy their presence on the show. Yes, they made the Winchesters look childish but that's actually how they have behaved previously, just no one called them out on it. Also it was pretty interesting to have demons be given more personality and learn that not all of them are completly evil and have motives.Despite that, I did find some flaws within the season. Sam and Deans arguments got even more repetitive, a couple characters from season 2 were written out of this season and the demon army didn't get mentioned that much, which was surprising as I thought total choas would've erupted from the release of those demons.All in all, the show took some new steps that I liked and keeps it going.",Positive
"When Nolan, the jaded scavenging veteran at the heart of the new Syfy series Defiance, strides from the Lawkeeper's office early in the pilot episode, seasoned viewers will recognize the streetscape. With storefronts built of reclaimed materials and stacked cargo compartments, it distinctly resembles the Eavesdown Docks from Joss Whedon's Firefly. And for good reason, since both shows shows channel the same American frontier mythology.Frederick Jackson Turner's seminal 1893 essay, ""The Significance of the Frontier in American History,"" identified the idea of frontier as the defining trait of American society. Crossing the invisible line from society to wilderness allows individuals to shrug off confining Euro-American stipulations of hierarchy, subjection, religion, and money. But Turner lamented that the closing of the American frontier, according to the 1890 census, marked the end of American pioneer fervor.Firefly, like Star Trek before that, rejects that closing by moving the frontier line off Earth's surface. New experiences and dynamic individualism remain for us to discover ""out there."" But Defiance alters that tack, suggesting that the movement of new species into our domain can open new frontiers where we are; the American pioneer ethos can be reinvested where we are. We need only destroy existing civilization to get there.Defiance's frontier myth doesn't need unpacked; creator Rockne O'Bannon splashes it across the screen in vibrant CGI Technicolor. Nolan's swagger, the city's ad hoc justice, and the contrast between settled urbanity and the vibrant Badlands, all bespeak classic cowboy heroes like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. This essentially American ethos (enacted here, ironically, by an aggressively international cast) creates a fusion of past greatness with future promise.This creates a world where people are judged by their actions, not their language. Nolan's adoptive daughter, Irisa, repeats some variant of the statement that ""promises are shtako"" in the first two episodes, first at Nolan, then at people generally. (Shtako, like Frak, is Syfy's attempt to get vulgarity past the censors.) Though she speaks for herself, Irisa represents the morality of a society in which present reality trumps either past laurels or future intent.Action is defined by a code that enforces standards without recourse to external motivations. Though appointed Lawkeeper at the end of the pilot, Nolan shows less interest in law than in justice, especially retributive justice. Though he tempers that in the second episode, when distributing righteous payback to a fugitive could doom the entire city, he still sees categorizes vengeance as ""do[ing] right by your dead child.""Nolan and Irisa's stance puts them at odds with Mayor Amanda, who advocates order. It's impossible to miss the fact that the Mayor, enforcer of order and the social contract, is a woman. Owen Wister, author of the classic Western The Virginian, described civilization as innately feminizing. Not for nothing does Wister's novel conclude with the Virginian's marriage to, and by implication his conquest of, the (female) civilizing schoolteacher from Back East.To its credit, Defiance doesn't seem aimed at such blatant sexism, though it uses gender as a metaphor for social morality. The tension between Nolan and Amanda, representing vigorous male action versus contemplative female deliberation, has not at this writing turned sexual, though we know it will. It plays the same symbolic role here that the tension between rough-n-ready Mal Reynolds and elegant Inara did in Firefly.But law and justice remain beholden to power. Human miner Rafe McCawley and alien financier Datak Tarr use money to sway Mayor Amanda, and McCawley manages to buy justice from Nolan. Casting Native actor Graham Greene, famed as Kicking Bird from Dances With Wolves, as McCawley is a masterstroke. It demonstrates, without words, how the frontier upends power structures. In episode two, McCawley growls, ""Predicting the future's a sucker's game."" And how. Men like McCawley don't predict the future, they make it.Near the end of the pilot, Irisa muses to her journal about the gap between ""the wild, open spaces where the weak are afraid to go"" and cities, with ""all the people jostling for space, sucking up the air."" She could not have summed up science fiction better. From Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury to Mal Reynolds and Han Solo, science fiction has always dreamed of crossing the frontier. But they, and Nolan, demand we ask: how will we know when we've found the fight worth having?Defiance makes a good contrast to this season's other sci-fi spectacular, Revolution. Where the latter says social collapse will hasten anarchy, violence, and a Caucasian type of dystopia, Defiance has another vision. It sees collapse as opportunity, and survivors as pioneers, not victims. Like the difference between Carter's ""Crisis of Confidence"" and Reagan's ""Morning In America,"" one seems more innately, viscerally American. Defiance is a mythology of hope.",Positive
A nice counterpoint to the lasting damage waged by Christina Crawford in &#34;Mommie Dearest.&#34; Great review of the career of one of Hollywood's most enduring and hardest working stars of the Golden Age. Some background and behind the scenes info brings Miss Crawford to life. It's hard to believe the woman Christine wrote about is the same woman. Ultimately Crawford's work outlasts any hatchet jobs by spiteful children getting revenge for being left out of the will.,Positive

"Well done.....storyline moves quickly, actors are believable, costumes are fun, and the finale was not overly graphic. I recommend this one to lovers of historical drama.",Positive
"The story of this was okay, but the comedic aspects were weak.  The concept would work well as more of a drama series with some comedy mixed in.  Also, the show shouldn't be about &#34;frat-house musicians.&#34;  Do they really party all that much?  Tone down the boozing and the sexuality a bit, and this could be a real mainstream hit.",Negative
Love it! you never knew what traumatic event was going to happen next. Keeps you on your toes for sure!.,Positive
This ensemble cast is so good together that it is hard to believe that they don't actually live together in Cleveland sharing an array of hilarious experience as each character looks for love and how to reinvent themselves anew after their lives in LA had left them feeling stuck and unattractive. It is easy to love the comedy with the sharp dialogue as well as the situation comedy and the extra bonus of great guest stars who appear on the show as a regular feature adding an extra surprise for every episode. I love this series it really makes me laugh out loud during every episode!And who can resist the charm and stand out performance by Betty White as oldest woman in the group who is not from LA but who has a really colorful background herself!,Positive
"King Henry VIII was a pivotal figure in English and Western history.  As the Protestant Reformation sweeps Europe, the great question is whether England will remain Catholic, under the Pope's authority, or whether the King's authority shall predominate in England.  King Henry VIII settled this matter for all time, at a time when religious authority truly mattered to the conduct of national affairs in Europe.This series is dazzlingly presented, with fine acting and a gripping, if somewhat leisurely, storyline.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers turns in a bravo performance as King Henry VIII--his intensity in the role is vibrant and convincing.  Sam Neill, as usual, is particularly fine as English Cardinal Wolsey, the King's Chancellor and confidant.  Along with Meyers he dominates Season One.  All of other the key roles are splendidly cast, and the sets are lavish; this is a beautiful production.Season 1 takes us from Henry's ascension to the throne, during which he gains confidence in his role of King of England and head of state--to his love of Anne Boleyn and his rejection of the queen.  The viewer sees in action Machiavelli's admonishment in The Prince that it is deadly to cross a Prince, and dangerous to be his friend.This series is eminently watchable and a great introduction to a critical period in European history.  If it takes liberties with history, the discerning viewer will not mind.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",Positive

My wife and I both watch it. It has some fairly decent writers. They leave a few holes in the logic but it is certainly entertaining.,Positive
"It took a little while for me to warm up to the show - i liked it but didn't spend a whole night sleepless watching it until around episode 7, at which point there was no turning back.  As others mention already, the set designs, actors and screenplay are very well done.. but what intrigued me most was that the historical period of the story basically coincides with the division of the church, from the rule of Catholicism to the outbranches of ""protest""-antism.  And the show goes on to become a study almost (and a very entertaining one at that) of the way this came to be (in England).  The story does a pretty fair job of presenting both the integrity and corruption of the Catholicism of Europe at the time and it likewise shows how and what drove the king to accept ""reformist"" versions of Christianity.  It's a fascinating study of a subject I really knew very little about and I come away feeling more informed somehow, and entertained into the bargain.  Even if religion isn't your thing, religion and politics were once quite married and intermixed with the state and it's fascinating to see these things portrayed - and to compare them with where we are now.  A fascinating historical story.  It's no wonder Shakespeare put it on the stage in his day.  Showtime has just sexed it up a bit.  And speaking of sex, if this show doesn't convince you of the power that libido plays behind the scenes, nothing will!",Positive

"I do not now and have not owned a television since the year 2000.  I read reviews of Breaking Bad and Bryan Cranston is one of my favorite actors.  so for the past six years, I read and read about Breaking Bad.  After joining Amazon Prime, I began with Falling Skies some episodes viewed at a friends home.I then decided to view Breaking Bad via Amazon Prime.  I spent the summer of 2013 viewing and catching up, I was riveted.  Not since the Sopranos have I been so captured by characters in development. There were some nights I watched three episodes in a row.For the final season, I used discipline and moderation. I refused to watch more than one episode per week and not read any reviews on the final seasons at all.  Walt white was not a role model, but you cared about him, even more than him you cared about his family. It was tragic in every way possible, but what else could you expect.  Great television.",Positive
"One good thing about the anthology horror &#8220;V/H/S/2&#8221; is that the sequel is much shorter than the original. The &#8220;frame story&#8221; gets tighter and more coherent. The main section has more variety in the subject matters and approaches than that of the first one.&#8220;V/H/S/2&#8221; has a similar opening to its predecessor, with a private investigator and his girlfriend looking for clues to a missing college student. What they stumbled upon in the student&#8217;s room is, of course, TV sets and VHS tapes.The introductory part is followed by four segments, each covering such topics as &#8220;ghosts&#8221; &#8220;zombies&#8221; &#8220;cult rituals&#8221; and &#8220;aliens,&#8221; with the &#8220;frame story&#8221; serving as a sort of interlude. The &#8220;zombies&#8221; part is more like a low-key comedy with a POV camera attached to a zombie. Probably the most impressive (and shocking) one would be the third segment about a documentary crew investigating a mysterious cult leader. All I can say is it is VERY gory.As far as storytelling goes, the second installment is an improvement on the first one. Even so, I think some of these stories could have been better with a conventional narrative style instead of using the found-footage format. The film is fairly entertaining, but I still do not see the point of sticking to this concept.",Negative
They need to wrap this series up this season. Acting is awful.,Negative
There is no better entertainment that can be had than that made in England.  I am now on Season 2 of this series and love every minute of it!  Pure entertainment and not the constant physical conflicts of American films.  Give me more like this!,Positive
I only recently started watching &#34;Vikings&#34; on Amazon and got hooked after the first episode !  The stories are great and so is the acting.,Positive
"This is definitely one of the most interesting and intriguing crime dramas I have seen in a long time.Too bad it only lasted two seasons.  I love the main character with his Zen philosophy, which made for some very nice creative lines from the writers.",Positive
"After waiting a long time for the final season, I must say, it was a bit drawn out and tedious, albeit good.  At times it achieve brilliance.  But mostly, it felt as if the director couldn't bear to let go, many minutes of staring, probably intended for dramatic tension but had the opposite effect.  Still, overall, this is a fantastic series from beginning to end and I loved seeing the Dad from Malcolm in the Middle have a chance to shed that typecasting and show that he is an absolutely phenomenal actor!  The young man who plays Jesse, his sidekick, throughout, is also excellent at bringing forth a very complicated, deep-feeling, lost soul.",Positive
Bones Season 9Fox .. Absolutely love love this show. Very happy it was renewed for a tenth season and that it's coming back to Monday Night.,Positive
"My nephew loves this show.  It is an effective learning tool as well as entertaining. I am an adult who likes cartoons so it's no great hardship for me to watch with 1 child or more.  For those adults who are not so keen, I don't think this show will task your patience too much.",Positive
"As with my comments for Justified Season 2, I love this series.  In fact, am addicted to watching it.  The DVDs from Amazon are great quality.",Positive

"I can't say it was a useful propostion except for mixing up the labelling. He started out as part man but mostly guru and endes up as mostly man and part guru. When he was unveiling himself, it took a long time; he did not appear shaven and talking in an american voice in one shot. This was so his students could make the transition without going into shock and he assures them a part of him is ""still Kumara"".It would have been diabolical to have forced them to make their own sudden transitions because not all could have survived. The 10/14 received an empowering transformation that they have the power to be their own guru. The main problem seems to be that they need support and affirmation and they can't do it alone. Presumably going to church is not enough or it is too old-fashioned.There is a deeper question to this film. Is Kumara an atheist or an agnostic.? If he isn't  does he know he thinks like one? To an atheist it is obvious people create God,  not the other way around. It easy to translate the metaphor into what he did ; the higher Self was used to illustrate we create it all. The relationship with Ghandi is so one-on-one ,that it is a short cut on the God abstraction,which is why it never crops up and why there is so much dependence fom the students. But I do wonder if Ghandi is being reticient. ( also  true if he was an agnostic)I was impressed by how decent the seekers were and how important this value was. It transcends any foolhardy exposure, which they may have unwittingly brought on themselves.I got a kick out of seeing my own yoga group of choice flash on-screen. I have been where these students are withthe whole sublimation of identity into the yoga one. I crashed. The way into self is through an agnostic/atheist route,I found. Even the Bhuddists are not into God if you really go into the teachings.",Negative
"The series was alright.  Some parts of last season seemed a bit rushed, and put in as a an after thought.  Plays with time travel, but not in any kind of way that will impress you.",Positive
"First up,I decided to watch the pilot solely on the fact Aldis Hodge was headline it. I was not happy he was a black con but, at least, he showed more moral fiber then the rest.That said, I found myself really into all the other characters. I hate the Lawyer and the Irish dude, I like the Clown, I feel the french women, who the show does seem to be focused a bit too much on, is  the one 2 dimensional character of them all, the cop, I think, has room to develop a solid persona and the old lady needs some work, but she provides, interestingly enough, a comedic element to the show. As for the Call Woman, I reserve opinion on her.As to the story, it almost came over as Lost without the island, but I did not get the same &#34;We got a secret nahna nahna nah na&#34; for this show. There is a mystery, for sure, but I do not feel the writers will be using that mystery to draw viewers in, without giving them some answers.I really and truely hope this show gets picked and I get to watch more exciting, and intriguing episodes.",Positive
This is one of the most underrated shows on TV. I have converted quite a few people to this show who now all love it. I did the same thing with Breaking Bad before it blew up and became a culture phenomenon. Hopefully this show will gain more followers who discover it.  While this isn't on the level of breaking bad it is still a very good show.,Positive
"The movie opens in Oct.21, 1994 in classic horror/slasher style. The killer has an unhealthy ""Ring"" like connection to his TV. He also has a hand held camera to film his killings. The film is grainy, a woman is screaming, there is blood, and a dog is barking. Good horror stuff. By the time it is all over, cops show up and everyone is dead. The opening includes a great leaping stab.In today's time Julian (Johnny Pacar) is making a movie of the event as a class project. He also seeks some stock footage from the local news station. In this horror film we are given the gratuitous nude shots of the young girls as they are being secretly filmed by Quinn (Toby Hemingway) the teen who works at the news station. Quinn in turn sells these thumb drive films to a local admirer (policeman Christian Slater) of the female form. As expected the ""Ring"" aspect we saw earlier enters the film.I liked the discussion of the ""hand-held"" camera technique. The maker of the film claims it gives the movie ""energy"" while the viewer describes it as giving him ""a headache."" Toby Hemingway plays a good moody psychotic teen. Decent sound track.F-bomb, No sex, Nudity (Jana Veldheer, locker room extras) 4 1/2 STARS",Positive
another son favorite very intresting he must really love it cause he has gotten 2 seasons try you might like,Positive
one of the worst movies of all the time...terrible movie..who wrote this movie??? the director must be shooooot himself...this is a low cheap budget movie terrible...stay away...,Negative
"If anyone needs a reminder as to how many British colonials felt about the people and customs of the countries they occupied during their Empire years, then this will serve as a refresher. It's sad to know that apartheid was alive and well and that lives of country people had very little value other than to serve the 'obviously' superior occupiers. Despite that, this wonderful mini-series brings humanity, hope and real ethics and values into play via Trevor Eve. We like to think there were those like him who really did struggle for the dignity of all. Very well written and performed. You will enjoy it completely.",Positive
"i wasn't able to see the  actual show as it concluded on tv so I didn't mind spending the little bit of money and purchased the last two in the series&#8230; it was so worth it.

"I'm finding the show is dragging at times. It's still a really good show, however the network staple of 20 plus shows a season seems to take it's toll on writers to produce high quality in every episode. I find my mind wandering during certain episodes, but all in all I'm still a fan and still watching.,",Positive

"What a bore.  How many more Blair Witch Project copy-cats are people going to make?  I guess if you like the show where the people &#34;hunt Big Foot&#34;, running around in the woods in the dark with shaky cameras saying &#34;did you hear THAT?&#34; every 2 minutes, you will like this one.  In this one instead of  running around in the dark woods,  they run around in a dark mine with shaky cameras saying &#34;did you hear THAT&#34; every 2 minutes.

"This series had promise, but the story is very weak. Feels like &#34;Terra Nova&#34; all over again. Okay, it is a little better than &#34;Terra Nova&#34;, but not much.",Negative
The clone wars is a great series that I really appreciate as it is one of the best star wars animations throughout the series.,Positive

Overall Prison Break was a very good show. Show title could have been better. This season they are put in a prison in another country and have to break someone out. Not a good season at all. Prison was boring and a lot of the new players were boring. Putting them back in prison was not a good idea. Had a shocking moment and some good points but not a great season weakest of the 4. Buy only if you like the show.,Negative
"Love the &#34;boys&#34; , even Louis.  The continuous story line necessitates having the entire series to get the full effect.  Plan on buying the second season when it is released.",Positive
"As a long-time Whovian (early 80's to be exact), I don't think I'm being overly hasty when I say I'm just not feeling Doctor Who these days.  Yes, It's by far the best written, best filmed, best acted science fiction currently being produced on planet Earth in the early 21st century but it's just become so...sentimental.Weeping Angels - one of the creepiest and creative alien threats television has seen since the Borg, but The Angels Take Manhattan's excellent premise becomes a weepy, heart-on-your-sleeve farewell to the Doctor's resident couple and a hello to the return of the annoying and not-so-sexy (although the writers do their utmost to convince us of the latter) River Song.  Seriously, when this episode was premiering on BBC America I came so close to changing the channel during the musical, team-suicide interlude and subsequent ultra-weepy Amy farewell and I have rarely felt that way about this series since the latter years of the original.  Loved the addition of Mark Williams (a.k.a. Mr. Weasley) as Rory's father but again the super-sentimental cube episode where the focus was so much on a domesticated doctor and the conflicted Rory and Amy that even the introduction of Lethbridge Stewarts daughter couldn't alleviate my deepening revulsion.  Asylum of the Daleks, on the other hand, was an overall brilliant episode with a plot twist so creative Rod Serling would've been impressed and in A Town Called Mercy, the juxtaposition of American Old West and aliens was refreshing and I loved seeing an ex-Stargater (Ben Browder) making a cameo as the town sheriff.  All things aside, very awesome episodes but I'm not sure why they made so few.Rory and Amy are just so much in love - *pukes all over the carpet*.  Please excuse me but exactly why does my favorite Time Lord need ""the girl who waited"" and the ""centurion who waited"" tagging along to scold, whine or otherwise argue with him on every adventure.  Yes, Rory can be very funny at times and Amy is feisty and adventurous but I think that the show would've been SOO much better if they were just two companions travelling with the doctor, who happened to like each other with less of the cosmic-destiny timeless romance theme.  I've noticed a fundamental transition of the Doctor mythology from time-travelling, eccentric and meddlesome alien to something more analogous to a Piers Anthony ""Incarnation of Immortality"" and although I don't have a problem with that personally, I do however suspect that If it were possible to do a multiple incarnations episode, like in the early days, Jon Pertwe would probably slap number eleven and tell him to ""man up"".I think if I could ask Steven Moffat one question it would be the following: ""when are you going to bring in Benedict Cumberbatch as the 12th doctor cuz that would be SOOO epic"".",Positive
Season 2 packed as much of a punch as season one with a little more spice! A great show to watch!,Positive
Seasons 1 and 2 were so fun and entertaining.  The rest of the seasons were less than great and the new wives were too crass.  But Season 3 is better than season 4.,Negative
If you into drama with action this is a nice one with some twists and mystery.  Though something in the story seem a little off from what military would do.  Its fun to watch if you into military conspiracies and twists.,Positive
I love this series I am so hooked the storyline with red john is so interesting he is always one step ahead so cant wait to find out who it is would recommend to anyone,Positive
I love this series. I was expecting it to pick up from season 1 like all series do. I was surprised with a different horror story. I LOVE that! Season 2 was just as awesome as season 1. The episodes are well written and twisted. You never know what is going to happen. The acting is superb. I love Jessica Lange. Her acting has always been of the highest caliber. I am enjoying her in this series and hope she will be in future seasons. The setting in the asylum was creepy. I haven't always liked the flashing between times in a movie/tv show but it worked flawlessly here. Excellent viewing! I recommend this series.,Positive
"*****SPOILER ALERT: there may be a few spoilers ahead*****I've watched two episodes of ""The Bridge"" so far.  I think it is brilliantly written, the cast is top notch, and I am curious to find out where the story is going.  There is only one problem for me, and that is that I have no patience and no warm feelings toward the lead detective, Sonya, played by Diane Kruger.  I understand that she is supposed to be afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome, but to me, that does not explain her constant bizarre and inappropriate behavior.  One would assume that a detective would have learned, through years of experience, how to display at least a minimum amount of empathy and humanity when speaking to a man whose wife has just been murdered.  Nope....not this detective, apparently.  She undresses in the office, in front of her male supervisor.....who does that?  I don't know if it is the way Sonya is written, if it is poor acting, or a combination of both.  But I just can't stand her, and I cringe every time she opens her mouth.For these reasons, I am rating ""The Bridge"" only 3 stars, and I am not even sure if I want to continue watching.  I have never been able to enjoy a program when the lead character is completely unlikable.  I want to watch and see what will happen next, but I just wish the writers would do something to make Sonya more human and believable in her role.EDITED: I have updated my review to 5 stars after watching episodes 3 and 4.  I decided to give Sonya and ""The Bridge"" another chance, and I am very glad that I did.*****MORE SPOILERS AHEAD*****The plot keeps getting more interesting, and the suspense is heightened when a young woman is left to die in the desert, on camera.  Will the El Paso detectives and the FBI find her before it is too late?All of the supporting actors here are top notch.  Ted Levine and Annabeth Gish are especially strong and believable in their roles.  I am surprised by how much I enjoy Matthew Lillard as the sleazy reporter; he's such a jerk, but he cracks me up with some of his comments.Sonya/Diane Kruger is beginning to soften a bit, which is what I was hoping for.  I don't have to necessarily ""like"" the character, but I just want to believe she is a real person, good or bad.  In the first two episodes, I wasn't buying Sonya at all, even as someone with Asperger's.  But in episode 3, she made me laugh (""We can't have sex here!""), and she was believable.  Finally, in episode 4, I felt her humanity.  When she was watching the video of the woman in the desert, you could see that she was genuinely concerned for her.  And when she was talking to Hank about her sister, that's when I could see Sonya as a believable, even vulnerable person.  Yes, she still has some quirks and flaws, like we all do, but she is not the strangely robotic person I saw in the first two episodes.I'm really impressed with this show, and very glad I decided to watch two more episodes.  Now I am officially HOOKED.  Diane Kruger is doing a good job in a difficult role. I now believe that the writing was the issue in the beginning, and writing Sonya seems to be a work in progress.",Positive
I love this series!  My ancestors are from Ireland so I love the scenery & the dialect.  The storylines are great. Can't say enough good abt this series!,Positive
"I love this series! It's addictive- almost like a soap opera, but more wholesome. My husband enjoys the series, too.",Positive
"Can't wait to start season II, always something new.  The cast is perfect for this show, it's serious and funny at the same time.",Positive
Kept the main cast. Brenda is not here but her husband is. Has a little bit of roughness when it comes to personalities clashing and people have to change their basic characters temporarily but all in all it is enjoyable.,Positive

"I'm not a prude...and I like the occasional &#34;F&#34; word as well as the next person...but geez...I couldn't follow the dialogue for ducking all of the F bombs being tossed about.  Really is it necessary? For that very reason I don't think I'd watch another episode....and I'm sorry about that too cause I LOVED the XFiles think Chris Carter is excellent. Oh well, not this time.",Negative
Another enjoyed season of show with granddaughter.  The adventures and Learning that are in this show are educating and dancing after are fun for granddaughter to do,Positive
"Somewhat convincingly acted - B.Somewhat creative/twisty, ghost in a house with a sordid history, storyline. The ghosty kid in the hallways, their toys and hiding places and the bad adults that send them to ghost land does get a bit old after a thousand similar previous iterations - B.Somewhat well made & novel CG effects, prosthetics & set staging - B.The problem is the ending (last half hour or so) seemed weak, stereotypic and suggested that the writers just ran out of those &#34;living dangerously&#34;, creative juices - D.Writers moralizing about how death, no matter how horrific the event and how young the victims, reassures us that they are in a better place and happier for it. Well, sorry writers about your fantasizing, but the young people I've seen die, a few in not pleasant ways, would disagree with your comfortable arm chair writing imaginings.",Negative
"I love the old setting for war movies.  Ancient Rome, England or Scotland.  This is a pretty good one.  Leaves a little to be desired, but good overall.",Negative
The creators of Gavin and Stacey (Ruth Jones and James Corden) are the &#34;best friends&#34; in this series and they are hysterical.  The writing is great and the characters are all memorable (especially Uncle Bryn - Rob Brydon).  I was really sorry to see this show end and happy to find web rumors of a possible movie.  I would love more of this group of people and the wicked humor you have to love...,Positive
"Season one and two were really over the top, lots of VIOLENCE.  Guess the censors have put a curb on that, not so much last season and even less this year, unless you call getting bean bagged violent.  I've been shot once myself so the effect was right on, though I question a man's ability to move around much after being shot five times.  Still, I love this series and hope it lasts longer than 5 seasons.",Positive
The story line was different and from the first half I was happy that it was Damon and Elena turn and Mr. Whitmore doing experiments on vampires was weird. For the mid season finale I can't believe that Damon broke up with Elena well I hope that they get back to together soon.,Positive
"I am shocked that this is network television. I would never have guessed had someone not mentioned it in another review. I am not surprised that it only got one season. There are alot of wonderful things about this show. Crafted well, acting is first rate, and while some of the plot lines are predictable, they are written and performed well. It's a great premise and the possibilities are sadly left unfulfilled. Would that it had a chance to grow into what it might well have been - one of the best things on network tv.",Positive
"Love all of these actors, especially the veteran ones!  The music is superb and it is set in New York.  What's not to like?!  The storyline is great and I cannot wait to see the second episode.  Great job!!  It is a keeper!",Positive
"How can secrets get stolen their secrets??? So that why I didn't get it five stars, thanks for these shows",Negative
The actors on the show are very talented in presenting such complicated legal arguments and pursuing them in court.  They also portray their personal life with style.  People can feel the problems with their relationships.,Positive
"I absolutely loved GRAVE ENCOUNTERS. I would place it high in the ranks of my films that came out the year it was released and include it in my list of top notch horror films of all times. For me it hit every note exactly right. Not so with the follow up film which fails more often than it succeeds, the usual problem with most sequels.If you haven't seen the original it revolves around a ghost hunters' type program that we find is more staged than reality. In that film the terror rises when they discover that the ghost are indeed real and that they prevent the crew from ever leaving unless they're placed in a body bag. It offered some truly scary moments and a general sense of unease that prevailed from start to finish.The reason for its failure can be seen in the majority of the opening sequence which takes up perhaps the first half of the film. Instead of a professional crew we have a student film maker who along with his friends spends most of his time getting drunk and trying to have sex. When he begins to look into the disappearance of the original crew he eventually talks his group into seeking out the abandoned hospital and investigating it on their own. The problem is that the majority of film time here involves them partying and swearing like sailors as opposed to furthering the story along. The whole opening segment feels like wasted film and time and something to just fill out the story instead of add to it.When the group finally gets to the hospital they're confronted by a guard who prevents them from entering. But this is a determined group and they eventually find their way in. When the guard enters to pull them out things begin to happen starting with the guard's death. Frightened and unable to leave, the group searches for a way out just like their predecessors did. It's not until later in the film that they stumble across the sole survivor of the original film, the host of the show, who has been trapped here for years. Can they escape with his help even though he hasn't been able to all this time?That's the sort of stupid question that comes up in this film. The scares that we see are this time around more predictable than the first time even though there are some creepy moments to be seen. But the sense of discovery found the first time around is lacking this time and the whole initial sequences do nothing but make you want to reach for the fast forward button rather than wait until something happens.I don't think I can even give this film an A for effort since it seems like so little effort went into making this a good picture. It feels like someone realized they had a cult hit on their hands and decided to keep the ball rolling rather than take the time to add something to the story. Sure the part with the old host adds something but at the sake of dead air time (no pun intended) prior it isn't worth it. Sorry but I can't recommend this movie to anyone, including fans of the first film.",Negative
"mental illness is a fascinating thing and how people get attached to objects because they've been let down by friends or family is really fascinating. I don't, however, feel sorry for them. they are fully aware of what they are doing",Positive
"Let me make one thing clear: there is nothing wrong with this show. It's a perfectly good cartoon. Well, its CGI equivalent, anyway.It seems to do everything right. The animation is stylish without ever taking itself too seriously. It draws many of its styling cues from the hugely successful 80's series, but always in a relatively subtle way. It never merely apes its progenitor, but from the opening titles to the color of April's shirt, it constantly pays homage to that august predecessor. It even knows when to turn squarely in the opposite direction: we get the ""angry"" Raphael from the real original version of the turtles - the Eastman and Laird comic books - rather than the jokester first minted in the ""kiddified"" Archie Comics version, which then went on to become world famous in the first turtles cartoon.So this is a show that's stylish, clever, and certainly light years ahead of the 80's cartoon on any kind of technical level.And yet...For me, this series never quite pops. Something's missing here. Certainly none of the characters have the stand-out charisma of the original animated versions of Shredder and Krang. The way those two would bicker like an old married couple; the way that version of the Shredder would groan with such heartfelt outrage at each fresh ignominy visited upon him. An enormous amount of the original show's appeal came directly from that evil duo. Even Bebop and Rocksteady grabbed your attention and brought an out-loud laugh to your face in a way that nothing in this latest version does. If I had to put my finger on just one thing as lacking in this latest version, I'd have to say that it's really GOOD bad guys.Like I said in the beginning, there's nothing wrong with this show. It's a perfectly good cartoon. It's just that... Well, whatever ""X Factor"" may be, the 80's version had it, and this one just doesn't. I want it to - I swear I do. Because on the surface at least, this is a series that's making all the right moves.I want to love it. I really do.But somehow... I just don't.Theo.",Negative
"This is loosely based on the fantastic movie of the same name which was done by the Coen Brothers. This tv series is also their production. If you love their work, and I do, you will love this series. These are the same kinds of quirky people located in the tundra of Minnesota-N.Dakota whom we met in the movie version. It is snowing all the time seemingly but they have adapted. They all hunt, ice fish, know everyone in their environs and are as deadpan as can be. They all love guns. These people are not like anyone you or I know unless we also live in that section of the country.Fargo the movie had a put-upon everyman played by William M. Macey and Fargo the tv series has one as well, named Lester. Both characters take a turn towards the criminal when their families humiliate them one time too many. Lester becomes murderous yet at all times still remains a wimp insurance salesman. Everyone in town went to high school with him and knows him as a wimp.The sheer genius aspect of this series was adding Billy Bob Thornton to the cast. He is absolutely ideal as the stone cold killer drifting into town who takes Lester under his wing. There are also some less intelligent killers apart from Thornton who reprise the dolts from the movie version very well.There is a woman deputy sheriff as well but this time she is single and somewhat interested in her police counterpart from Duluth. He is a bit of a doofus, played by Colin Hanks, but with a sharp as a tack teenage daughter.I am definitely watching the rest of the series based on these early episodes I've been watching. The series should be a major hit in 2014 for the FX channel. I can tell it is a quality production every step of the way.Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

"While it falls a bit short of the book by being an ongoing series, so far it has been enjoyable though I find myself wondering how they will stretch this ONNNNNN for a tv series witthout losing its &#34;edge&#34;. So far we have not ventured too far afield from Stephen King's book and it retains its suspense but I am waiting to see if the second seson can retain the quality of the first and where the storyline will go ow that the town villain has been &#34;unmasked&#34; and is trying to make amends...or is he???",Positive

"""It don't happen often but sometimes we do bring out the best in each other."" After the death of his wife famous writer Monte Wildhorn (Freeman) stops writing and takes up drinking. He moves into a lake house to escape everyone and relax. After meeting his neighbor Charlotte O'Neil (Madsen) and her daughters he begins to change the way he feels about life. One of the biggest problems I have with movies is that about 70% of them are so predictable that after ten minutes you know how it will end. Sometimes that affects how good a movie is and sometimes it doesn't matter. This movie is the later. After fifteen minutes I could have written the ending myself and it would have been identical to the way this one ended. All that said this is a great movie still and Morgan Freeman is about the only actor who can take a very ornery character and make you like him even at his worst. There are not many non-cartoon movies that are great for the whole family to watch. This is one of them. Rated PG but this is still something that you can put in with your kids and not have to worry about what they are seeing. This is a perfect example of how excellent a movie can be simply by using the best actors you can find and having a great idea. No special effects or nudity or swearing. What a strange idea. Overall, a superb family movie that I highly recommend. I give it an A.",Positive

Amanda's sister Danielle (Christie Burke) tags along as the moody ""whatever"" girl.The first half of the film takes place in the car. We are filled with the ""Turn the camera off!"" and ""Okay it's off"" stupidity. They detour to a place called the Crowsnest to get half priced beer only to be harassed by slashers in a travel trailer for the second half of the film during which we see film footage of trees and ferns.This is a lousy ""kids in the woods"" film made worse with terrible found footage and a bad script. If you are going to skip one found footage film this year, I think you found it.Parental Guide F-bomb. Brief Nudity (Mittita Barber). Near sex.",Negative
"This is the 2nd season/series of the rebooted Doctor Who featuring Matt Smith as the 11th Doctor, and he does not disappoint in the slightest.  Very impressive acting and the character has a feeling of being very genuine and very authentic.  The show continues to thrive and is both fun and entertaining to watch, and some of the stories, while outwardly entertaining, also really make you think about things in ways you otherwise might have overlooked - which I feel is true of several seasons/series of Doctor Who - but it certainly continues in this one.  This year again featured the Ponds, Amy and Rory as The Doctor's companions.  Excellent special effects as usual and great writing, but superb acting, especially by Matt Smith.  Matt Smith may have been the only person who could have adequately followed David Tennant's 10th Doctor in the iconic and legendary role.  I am truly impressed with how good this program is and I highly recommend it to anyone.",Positive
"Justified just keeps getting better by the season, the characters and situations encountered by our heros (I'm including the other Marshall's) just keeps getting better and better.  Season 3 is a must see, ending in a great fashion.  Introducing new characters that are not just throw away, this is a show built to run.Season 4 is also great, this next year will be season 5.",Positive

"This is a show that was a different concept.Everyone from alcatraz is missing for something like 40 or 50 years, then one by one tthey start showing up again, but they haven't aged, and if they were bad before they still are now.Sorry that this series was cacelled.",Positive
There is no tv show that can rival Leverage. this is the greatest written crime drama that i have ever had the pleasure of watching...,Positive
This show is highly addictive. You get involved in the rich story lines and you will fall in love with the cast.,Positive
Loved this pilot episode. The watched six feet under and loved that show so I was pumped about this show. The storyline is one that I haven't seen before and is great! I will definitely watch this show again if it makes it.,Positive
"I loved the story lines - well written, developed, and carried from episode to episode. I was completely blown away by the gorgeous photography of classic and modern European sites. Placing this series internationally was a stroke of genius! Paris, Rome, oh my! The team members of this elite crew of top notch investigators meshed beautifully and each character was given their own exposure, quirks and sins all. I have been a Donald Sutherlan fan forever and was so glad to see him in this in his patriarchal role. William Fitchtner has really come into his own in this show - marvelously mature acting of a decorated police officer fallen into the depths of drug addiction after a maiming gunshot wound in the line of duty. He displays the high intelligence, self-pity and pathos of his character all at the same time he is climbing out of the depths he has sunk to. His slow recovery is agonizing to watch as it is very realistic. Marc Lavoin is mesmerizing in his role as Louis, the head of this international crime fighting unit. When his own personal tragedy is revealed it is heart breaking. The rest of the team is equally talented. I like them all and hope to hell-o the folks at NBC are bright enough to pick this up for Season 2. I am eagerly looking forward to its continuance.",Positive
"I usually watch a more serious program, but end the night with one episode of this program. The humor puts me in the right frame of mind for a good night's sleep.Anyone who likes BBC comedy will thoroughly enjoy this program.",Positive
"I like the information presented for children. The characters are child-pleasing with reasonable diversity included, and their music compositions have an interesting &#34;recycled&#34; process (although they perform many songs, you can recognize some passages that have been remodeled to create new songs). The music is something that is enjoyable to both us and our baby.",Positive
Great combination of spy thriller and domestic drama. Really clever premise and Keri Russel and Matthew Rhys really are great and believable in the lead roles.,Positive
"I must admit, on first viewing I wasn't all that impressed, in fact I had rated this thing a 4, but afterwatching it a second time, maybe with a few more beers down my neck, I love this flick and I am lauging my AO!OK, the family was crazy, but the problems with this film is that all the interesting and crazy members of thisfamily are either dead or in jail. The rest are just a bunch of redneck trailer trash pregnant women but they arepretty entertaining. I love the scene where Bertie is released from prison, goes to kidnap her husband from hisgirlfriend's house, hijacks him to the drug store where they got prescriptions for pain pills filled from thepharmacist who had originally married them. hahahahaaThis is a two hour marathon about a bunch of ignorant hicks from West Virginia. We got grandma, her daughter, anda bunch of grandkids sitting around her house smoking pot, snorting pain pills, and drinking beer they cant afford.But then how the hell do they all afford the drugs and cars cause none of them have jobs. You heard me, none of them,not one.I guess I wasn't so impressed with this insane flick cause being from Tennessee and knowing worse families, oh yeah,there's nothing here that I haven't seen before. These guys are a bunch of Pikeys compared to the Jetts, the Stinetts,Blackwells, and the Whiteheads of Marshall County. On second thought I may be a little jealous cause I wont be doingany Oxys, Roxys, Coke, or smoking any pot at my mom's house when I go home for Thanksgiving this years. LOL",Positive
"Always keeps us on our toes....love the characters.....the action....especially Simon Baker.....just odd...not quite right....but, then again, always right ! We watch it all the time !",Positive
Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Young Norman is really into being off the wall.  The mother is a pure crazy and let's not forget the older son's return that seems to stir up things between and around Norman.  Looking for more.,Positive
"The talent this year has yet to disappoint.  On this 3rd episode the challage was, as teams of two they were to fabricate by mixing both of the animals each represented in the chinese calander (i.e ox and rat), and they had to withstand a dance sequence.  I was impresed by any sad by who went home. Can't wait for the next episode..",Positive
Good show.  Not too violent and lots of humanity and common sense themes.  Lead actor is excellent and the autistic kid is awesome.,Positive
"A supposedly erotic fantasy about two foolish women and the moral vacuity that causes them to ruin their own lives, those of their sons, their sons' wives and their grandchildren. The conflict is specious, as is the situation itself. This is just more mommy porn. It has neither true conflict nor honesty.",Negative
It's really cool to see all the competition using so many different weapons under so many different conditions.  I much prefer the team competitions where they are paired up while competing...adds another dimension to the enjoyment and you get to see who is a team player vs. lone wolf.,Positive
"(do not read if you have not watched the first part - last episode)Now we know that the Doctor has something big coming up. A bullet - or a beam - from something, and the things in the shadows to boot. You cannot recall them and yet one was there, and it told Amy Pond she would reveal them. Then there was the odd place that River and Rory went, underneath the secret streets. as The Doctor says, this is not fighting an invasion because it was already here. it is creating a revolution. With Richard Nixon and his sidekick in tow, it seems that things have gone bad and the others are being hunted while the Doctor has a bad time. you know the doctor, however, and how good he is.This episode wraps up a first piece and explains what the enemy well be. I do not want to say so I will omit it, but I did not expect the name. I also did not expect the man and his love and Nixon and the kid, and I did not expect Amy and the revelation she had. I think she has something big coming and people have yet to notice.The acting is great here. Matt Smith has settled into the doctor and has his guy down pat. It makes me laugh, he has such an energetic humor, and I like that. I also liked the dark here and I thought they had plenty of it. The not seeing and not knowing, the marks on the arms; it added in and made a horror.The VOD is great here, too, and added together it well gets its 5/5. Thank you.",Positive
"Except of the moments of intense violence, this show radiates old fashioned values now in continued decline. The paterfamilias, played by Tom Selleck,  always does the right thing. Fun to watch. Love the family dinners and prayer.",Positive
"Exceptional acting, as usual. The story line wasn't as engaging as previous seasons. The &#34;menacing&#34; holler aspect didn't come to full bloom for me, he seemed all bark and no bite. Olyphant and Goggins are a delight to watch.",Positive
"Love this show, and it just keeps getting better!",Positive
Great cast and great first episode. Quality/entertaining television is hard to find on the networks. So far this show is really great.,Positive
"I wasn't much of an Office fan until somewhat recently, and I'm not quite sure why that is, but now I can't seem to get enough of it as I rewatch the seasons I currently own. I've now seen all of the episodes through season six, the second-to-last year of Michael Scott, and season four may very well be the best one, but it's a tough call because 3 and 5 are pretty darn good too.A few highlights include: Ryan is now at corporate, a funny and strange new variable; Andy starts dating Angela, with Dwight not entirely out of the picture; the Scanton branch creates a local advertisement; and Holly makes her debut in the finale, with Jan returning to get in the way of things.I of course recommend this to any fan of the Office. With that in mind; however, I would advise either purchasing or at least watching the previous season in its entirety first, for continuity purposes. Although some episodes in this season are better than others, I think every one of them are good and quite re-watchable. Either way, sit back and enjoy the hilarity that will ensue.",Positive
It was action packed.  Full of drama from cases to case.  The family dynamic that seems to surface in one way or another adds more suspense and action to the whole storyline.,Positive
Never let down by this show.  I have become a great big fan!  Every episode does not disappoint!  Feel free to buy this one.,Positive
"The writing of this series is excellent.  The story lines usually stand alone, however there have been some story themes that go throughout the series.  I found all of the episodes to be excellent entertainment.  I would like to have access to a season five.",Positive
"Slow... how slow? I had trouble staying awake. But DO STAY AWAKE -- once the introductions are out of the way -- and that takes a bit of time -- the movie is charming. The three-way relationship between Jenna Fischer, Chris Messina, and Messina's Mechanical Man (a new twist on a love triangle, no? Well, no, not really a love triangle but... well you'll see) is nicely developed and has a good story to tell.3 stars instead of 4 or more because the start was soooo slow. Enjoyed it nonetheless.",Negative
"The writers of the series keep me coming back for more.  I like the fact that it doesn't appear formulaic, other than the fact the Lewis and Hathaway always get their man (or woman).  Occasionally, the pair set a snooty Oxford nose straight.  Having visited Oxford only once, I enjoy seeing more than a tour bus could offer:)",Positive
This series is just alright. The acting is good and the characters are good but it is just alright. It isnt overly funny and it isn't real serious- it is sort of in the middle. I mildly enjoyed to pass the time but I wouldn't pay more than the membership to watch it .,Negative
"This is a very good show to watch online through Amazon. The price was reasonable & the picture quality was good. But since this show is often shot in dark settings, it is sometimes a little hard to see clearly. I should have tried it in HD even though it's more expensive, I probably will next time.",Positive
Granddaughter is 5 and she likes Pocoyo Season 2 a lot.  Laughs out loud.  Watches the same episodes again after a few days.,Positive
"A middle of the road, fairly amusing, end-of the world film that takes place one afternoon at a middle aged couples' suburban gathering, where the party-goers are kind of flaky to begin with.  As life on Earth unravels, conflicts and coping skills emerge to the sadness and the amusement of the viewer since this is in essence a black comedy. Mainstream religion comes in for a few knocks as well.  While it isn't really  a &#34;must see&#34; movie, it will serve you well as middling entertainment with a few hearty laughs thrown in.",Negative
"This movie is proof that if a movie isn't marketed correctly it won't succeed at the theatres. I loved the suspense, and Samuel L. Jackson played evil so convincingly, that it was, at times, terrifying to even look at him. This is probably a lower budget movie but I loved it! Great ending too! Don't be fooled by the fact that it didn't get top billing at the theatre. Neither did Galaxy Quest, but it is now a cult classic.If you enjoy this type of genre, Samuel L Jackson (Truly at his most evil), and surprise endings, watch this movie. If you are a Prime member you get to see it free, so you lose nothing. Really enjoyable film!",Positive
"After reading some of the reviews, I was quite hesitant... however, I decided to watch; and I thought it was good.  Julianne Moore never cease to amaze me with her acting skills and Jonathan Rhys Meyers was actually good in his character.  I recommend this.  I getting every cent out of my (LOL) 48 hour ""see it before it hit the theaters"" rental, because I plan to watch it again before it expires.  The best part  -- I didn't have to leave my house and I sat watching it in my PJs and enjoyed it!",Positive
"This is a badly made movie. Bad story, bad plot and terrible acting.It amazes me that movies this awful actually get made and distributed.",Negative
"This is classic television at its best. There are every so often, special people that pass through the world that find their niche, love that they did, and have a wonderful time sharing that love and knowledge with others. Julia is one of those rare people who get you excited about what excites them, and you are the better for it. No spin, no politics, no BS, just a gentle, lovely, brilliant woman teaching you everything you need to know about French cooking, and so much more. Simplicity at its best.If you're under 40 go have a fast burger somewhere; you probably won't &#34;get&#34; this show - it's slow, it not about YOU, and it's black and white - what's to like?If you're over 40 or retired, bon appetite!",Positive
I love this show! The writing is excellent and acting lives up to the engrossing plot-lines. I hope there will be a season 4 ...,Positive
"I watched this show the first season but then I stopped.  I recently caught up on all the seasons via Netflix and Amazon.  If you are looking for less &#34;romantic comedy&#34; and more yuck-yucks, then you would enjoy this show.  I personally, like romantic comedy which is why my favorite scenes are between Burt and Virginia who are just the most quirky yet &#34;in love&#34; couple on the show.  It is so sweet that they've been together since they were teenagers but never seem to be bored with each other.  Kind of inspirational and sort of gives credence to the term &#34;ignorance is bliss&#34;.",Positive
"John and Dave are sucked in to an interdimensional time warp after taking a mysterious new drug known only as ""Soy Sauce"" that opens their minds to an incredible array of new powers. Now, these two unassuming slackers have become humanity's only defense against the otherworldly beings that look to take over the world! When it comes to strange, twisted tales of supernatural horror, no one does it better than Don Coscarelli, leaving no better choice to direct the off-the wall Sci-Fi/Comedy JOHN DIES AT THE END. With JOHN DIES AT THE END, Coscarelli is once again left unrestrained by rules or logic thanks to the wild imaginings of David Wong in his original novel. While on the drug, the characters can communicate through time (let alone bratwursts), travel between dimensions, and even transcend death, which opens up an unlimited range of possibilities in this untamed universe. The problem is, Coscarelli starts the characters off in too many directions at once, and quickly loses focus as his signature form of non sequitur storytelling takes control. As a result, the failed attempt to wrap things up in the end feels rushed and unsatisfying, but the road leading up to it is both entertaining and exciting. Chase Williamson and Rob Mayes capture the satiric tone and irreverent humor perfectly through the characters of Dave and John, allowing the audience to overlook many other faults through their enjoyable performances. The smaller budget is also refreshing, since it forces the filmmakers to become more creative with both the outline of events and the special effects. There are more than enough stories to tell in this untapped universe, so hopefully the success of the film in the home video market will see JOHN brought back to life in a sequel!-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",Negative
"This could NOT have been casted better, the guy who plays Hannibal is brilliant! A serious genius and predator. Id you like the movies like I did, this blows them away! Watch this series, and Lawrence Fishbourne plays Jack Crawford not only correctly but with intent! The only thing that concerns me is they are moving to fast, I want this show too drag on for a few seasons! I have never seen anything like it, another new favorite for me. Also, watch Bates motel on A&E, it's not quite as jaw dropping but it is good.",Positive
"This story is about 8 astronauts going on the first major space exploration of the solar system. Everyone, except for a very small minority see it as the heroic journey, a tribute to human achievement and curiosity. A small minority know the truth, that ""something"" not human is picking the crew and developing the mission but this is a closely guarded secrete.The show is well written. The story doesn't develop quickly but feels more like a carrot put before the horse, always just tantalizingly out of reach. This effect is well done and works mostly because each show is so rich in and of itself that it's fun instead of frustrating to wait for the show to progress.The show is also very well cast. Character development happens quickly through main plot line which is interlaced with flashbacks that open up the undercurrents to us. It doesn't take long to see the characters as multidimensional people and feel an emotional connection with them.I'm sorry to see yet another series canceled before it's time. It seems like some networks don't really get it's sci-fi audience.  It make take a few seasons to get a loyal following but once word gets out about a great sci-fi show it makes a big splash and the shows popularity can carry on for years after a show is over.  Unfortunately, as long as networks create great shows but cancel them prematurely it will give fans little reason to give the shows on their network a chance. After all, why get involved with a show that needs time to evolve if it's going to be canceled before you get to the good stuff.It's very frustrating to see a show with so much potential get canceled, especially after only one season.",Positive
not funny - not silly - just stupid - really a waste of time if you watch this show .,Negative
"Im sure everyone would like to edit this movie in something a bit better,,,is it Ron 's red riding hood cape or that huge amount of cheeze, or maybethe mutants could have used a bit more errie vocals...but all said thisis a pretty good movie that wanted to do it all but could only do somuch due to many factors...We have trench warfare like world war 1&2...we have powerfull coorporationsbent on winning at all price, and we have the newly arrival of the MACHINE.So, it might not be the best,, but they sure tried and came out with thismovie that is worthy of a view.This is a keeper for me.",Negative

"May be spoilers belowMy mom and I went to see this.  We were thinking it was going to be a normal adult comedy.  Well, we were right and we were wrong.  We actually left after about 50 minutes, but what I saw was so stupid.  The movie had an art house feel.  People get neighbors.  They are a frat.  They ask them to keep it down and things go crazy.  That is the movie, at least from what I saw.There are so many things that happen that just didn't need to.  Like the guy being able to get an erection whenever he chooses.  I mean, really?  It just didn't make me laugh at all.Some of the stuff made me feel uncomfortable.  I know this is a movie, and none of this actually happened.  Still, it made me feel uncomfortable.  Like when the two are having sex and the baby is sitting right there looking at them.  I know what they were trying to do, but it didn't work.  The guy starts smoking a joint and there baby is there.  That didn't work either.  The two worst parts I saw were when the baby put the condom in it's mouth and when the doctor told them the baby had aids.  He was kidding, but I didn't find it funny.I have this pre ordered.  I may cancel that and just rent it when it comes out.  As I said, we saw like 50 minutes.  But, it felt like 15 or 20.  The movie just has the same thing happening over and over again.  It was just a childish movie.  If they didn't have the baby, it could have been better.  It is like they used the kid as a prop.  It was a waste of $16.50.After thinking a bit more about it.I was thinking more about this throughout the day.  Here are my thoughts.This movie has three parts.One is, two people who have a kid and are not yet ready to live the life of two adults.  They want to continue living a life of fun and continue to be carefree.Two, a couple still feel young and want to hang out with people younger with them.  They want to live their life with the people they want to believe themselves to be.Three, people have neighbors that are driving them crazy, care nothing about their feelings and live a crazy life.I asked myself.  If any of these parts were taken out, would the movie have been better?The part with them having a kid and not being ready to live like parents. That could be funny.  I think they could have made that a fun movie.  If they took out all the random use of the F-word, all the sex and random drug use.  I think it could have been great.If it would have been about two married people trying to live like they did when they were kids or teens.  That could have been funny.  If they did a movie like that and took the child out, it could have been really funny.  With the kid not in all the scenes, they could have swore, drank, did all the drugs and had all the sex they wanted.  I would have laughed a piece of my ass off.If they did a movie in which a couple tried to get rid of bad neighbors.  That could have been funny as well.  It would all depend on who was trying and whom they were trying to get rid of.  Husband and wife trying to get rid of neighbors would have added a fun element.  The actions and reactions between the two would have made for some good laughs.The problem is that I don't see how these three things can fit into one hour and a half movie.Another thing I realized is that perhaps some of it had to do with the actors.  I am not saying any are bad.  I like all of the actors I saw.  But, seeing Zac Efron as a druggy, partying teen didn't work for me.  I do not believe I have seen him in anything.  But it just didn't feel right.Dave Franco.  He seemed like a good actor.  I do not know what I have seen him in either.  But it just felt like he was wrong for the character.  I cannot explain why.Another reviewer said something.  They said it felt like you were watching clips.  I thought the exact thing as we were leaving the movie.  Nothing seemed to go together.  No story at all, or maybe there was a story, they just did not pull it off.There is a part of me that wants to finish the movie.  I want to see if there is any point to it and what the conclusion is.  That is why I kept my pre order.",Negative
I congratulate the actors for excellent portrayals of nurses and injured people who lived in the early years of the London Hospital. I can't wait until the next seasons are ready for viewing.,Positive

"I discovered this series after watching Robson Green play a clinical psychologist who explores the twisted psyches of serial killers on another police drama titledWire in the Blood - Complete First Season. Green certainly has a knack for portraying rather eccentric characters. In ""Touching Evil"", Green plays DI Dave Creegan who is assigned to the OSC (Organized and Serial Crime unit). After surviving a gunshot wound to the head, Creegan discovers a unique ability to get into the criminal mind. Creegan is assisted by DI Susan Taylor (Nicola Walker) and several others.Season 2 has three episodes:A Pupil of Murder - a reporter named Laney seems to have first dibs on the crimes of a serial killer who takes the hair of his victims as trophies. When the police catch up with the killer, Creegan's impulsive act results in a tragedy. However, even with the suspect in custody, the crime spree continues, and DI Taylor may be next on the list.The Caregiver - An ex-soldier is haunted by his experiences during the Bosnia War. He resorts to killing those who served with him, in a desperate attempt to erase those horrific memories.What Price a Child - Creegan gets intimately involved with a suspect in a child abduction case. Children go missing, and the police step up their efforts, focusing on several powerful men who are part of an international pedophilia ring. Meanwhile, Hawkins, father of a murdered victim from episode one has vengeance on his mind, and his target is not the killer, but DI Creegan whom he blames for the death of his beloved daughter. Trouble is, Creegan's own children may be targets too.Touching Evil is a gritty crime drama, and well worth watching for fans of the genre.",Positive
"Alpha House is a well written and well performed sitcom depicting the good and BAD things that happen in the government.

"Okay...I had no interest in watching this show before trying it on Amazon Prime.Definitely an adult guilty pleasure if you get the humor in it.  Forget the &#34;adult swim&#34; level animation.

"I really liked Hell's Kitchen when it first started.  I'd watched Gordon on one or two BBC series and sort of knew what to expect.However, the antics of the dysfunctional kitchen contestants has ruined this series for me.  It is less about what they can do than what they can't and I can do without the juvenile antics I wouldn't tolerate anywhere else.  I don't see this as entertaining.",Negative
Terrific casting;  loved Bernal as smug and talented (and knowing it).  Young musicians who actually work hard at a craft and not just playing with apps hoping to make their mark on the cultural scene.  Taking &#34;Flashdance&#34; a notch higher.  Wonderful watching millennials with aspirations beyond their looks.,Positive

"If I rated each episode individually it would be:Waters of mars - 5 stars  By far the best writing of all the episodes in the specials.Planet of the dead- 2 stars (although I will say that the black actor who plays the female general is absolutely superb in her performance.  Anyone know her name?)The end of time (both parts as one episode)- 3 stars.  This isn't as straight forward to rate because it has some parts that are great but for a large part they really weren't written that well.  The guy playing Donna's dad did wonderfully in his performance as always. I really love the master as a character for various reasons- just like the doctor he carries in him much pain and much joy as well (even though that joy is often from inflicting pain on others).  The defeat of the master in a previous episode was much more heartbreaking and dramatic as we saw The doctor suffer right in front of us when he once again became the last time lord.  This time it wasn't nearly as heart wrenching.  Also the saying goodbye of our beloved time lord was so drawn out (it basically started at Planet of the dead and in this episode he reminds us of the premonition every 10 minutes) that it became melodramatic.  Although the last words ""I don't want to go."" were beautiful and very realistic. All in all I found it dissapointing for a finale.",Negative
"They aren't afraid to share their views, and hold no punches. It may offend some, but if you want to feel refreshing honesty and see good family values hard at work, this is the show for you. Sure it's scripted and a bit cheesy at times, but I think each character is true to themselves, even during the scripted scenes.",Positive
I love it. I live in the south & it is just like how I grew up. It's a great cast. Hope it come back for another season or more.,Positive
"Better than Season 1 and Season 1 was GREAT!! Season 2 lives up to & surpasses Season 1. Great story line. Building of the character's profiles only enrches the story line. And that marshall...Yummy! If you enjoyed Season 1, you WILL enjoy Season 2.",Positive
"While being aimed at teen audiences, this is still worth watching ,  the story concerns people returning to earth after a nuclear war.  The show is interesting but they do need to have the cast find ruins and such to move about more. The people on the ground should also be mutants and we see a skeleton that's mutated, and then sadly a normal looking human. This show at least doesn't have aliens that look just like humans ala 'star crossed'.  This show is not badly acted though as some people claimed ,  This show has a good amount of potential , if they give it a chance and go out amongst the ruins and such.  It's fast moving and if they give it time it will have the characters grow hopefully.",Positive
I like this show but it only lasted one season so no reason to get to invested in it. But it was a fairly good show.,Positive
A guy shows up on the first episode in the nude joking about his dongle.  I'll pass.  I don't need this crap entertainment.,Negative

"As a HUGE fan of cop shows and procedurals, I was really looking forward to loving this pilot.  Production value is top notch, the casting director truly knows talent and the location access was pretty impressive.  Unfortunately, that's where the positive ends.Granted, I'm not familiar with the books but I shouldn't have to be to recognize a good show.  Given it's virtual who's who of talented character actors this should have been a slam dunk.  I don't think you can ask for a better lead than Titus Welliver in anything but given his skill-set, you've got to give him more to &#34;play&#34; than these cop procedural 101 scenes.You're asking me to follow him as a lead but don't really give me a reason to.  By the end of the piece I still have no real sense of who he is or how he operates.  Against the grain like Greg House or quietly clever like Columbo.  There is no character meat.  And that is saying something considering that Titus is one of the most &#34;character rich&#34; actors working today.In the pilot, nobody really likes him and no one really doesn't like him.  He's so middle-of-the-road I don't know if I like him.  All his relationships are identical, male or female with the possible exception of his partner played by Jamie Hector.  AKA one of the only actor who managed to find an interesting character to play given the trite, mundane dialogue of this entire show.  That said, I want to give special shout-outs to Amy Aquino and Alan Rosenberg who also shine through the plodding.Ultimately, it comes down to the writing that stops me from loving the show.  It's a so-so script.  For lack of a better term, it is &#34;lazy&#34;.  Especially for a show where you're not solving any cases in an single episode.  You've got time for the coming situations to breathe and happen more organically, right?  But the script doesn't use it.Classic example: There is a nice love interest brewing with Annie Wersching's character, Julia Brasher.  But the characters never have to work for it, you know?  A veteran officer and a rookie meet at a crime scene and are on a semi-first date within scenes of a 50 minute pilot.  This would be so much more interesting and rewarding had they let this happen more organically over several run-ins and/or incidents,  so it doesn't feel like this happening because the procedural handbook of a script says so.Another example --  The lieutenant (Amy Aquino) comes to Bosch's home to chew his ass.  She lays down the law and shuts him down and he needs to convince her to temporarily &#34;look the other way&#34;.  Does he maybe tell her how he's been slipping the last few years and need this to get back to the cop he knows he can be again?  No.  Does he then maybe tell her &#34;With all due respect, don't threaten me, Lieu.  I'm gonna close this case for you&#8230;for me.  Either arrest me now or get out of my way and let me do it.  I'm asking for a second chance here.&#34;Either of which would given us more drama (possibly) or, a least, given us more sense of the man.  But, no, he doesn't do either. Instead he hands her a box with a bone in it and says, &#34;Look at this.&#34;  And she, who's seen 1000 bones in her career and will most likely see 1000 more before it's over -- caves.  WTF?!  Really?!We, as an audience, are not challenged or engaged in the piece because our lead character is not.",Negative
"Like a train wreck, you know you should avert your eyes and move on, but you just HAVE to have a look.  That's the guilty pleasure I get from watching this wicked TV Series.  The plot meanders and gets thin in spots, but it somehow keeps me riveted and coming back for more.",Positive
"If you watch only John Barrowman's scenes, you are watching a very tight, very interesting, very stern characterization.Oliver Queen is insane - a serial killer - and it was amusing watching him that way for the first several episodes but the rest of the cast is tedious and it just became watching a clique of people who might not even like each other - certainly Diggle seems to hate Oliver on occasion - but are intent on driving on with this Batman/Buffy impersonation.  It starts to make the characters reprehensible for their striding insincerity.But Malcolm Merlyn's glare and fantastic delivery of his few lines are gems.",Negative
"No longer have normal TV was so glad to catch up with Auggie and Annie and the gang for this 4th season here on Amazon Prime.  I've been a fan of spy shows since a kid, so this one is a great and modern bent on the theme.  I read a review here that Piper Perabo is the weakest actor in this show...pshaw!  She is a gorgeous, athletic, compassionate and lighthearted WEAPON against the bad guys. You go girl!",Positive
"There is a lot going on this season.  Brutal at times, but it continues to be a well written/acted series.",Positive
Annie always pleases along with her co-stars. It is one of our favorites. She is just enough naughty to make it fun without being slutty.,Positive
"What can I say that hasn't been said before about this program?  Satire is the most ancient of critiques of our world as we know it, Bards sat at the court of the kings and told them off with humor and song and their second task was to bring the news to the people, to make sure they were informed...and today that ancient of traditions continues with Jon Stewart...",Positive
"There is a great moment in this particular episode.There is a scene where one of the faux mountain men is working at his sawmill. They claim the sawmill is water powered. The whole premise of the show being that these ""mountain men"" are living a subsistance life in the hills by the old ways.Not only do they show that the generator is so small that it cannot possibly power the sawmill, they actually show the gasoline engine that does power the sawmill in the background. Its right there connected with belts to the sawmill.I know what reality television is. But when they give up the basics of even trying for a suspension of disbelief, its all just kind of sad. Their audience would not have thought any less of a guy running an old gas-powered sawmill and when people finally figure out that they are being treated like fools, they tend to all walk away at once.",Negative
"What an awesome season!  Katy(Gemma) story line was so well acted.  Opie's grief for Donna and Jax's decision to keep it quite and fallout that occurs from keeping that secret, was a nice character development.  Highlighting Chib's is what I like about the show;  we are continuously learning about each one in a wonderfully written show.  Bring on Season three.",Positive
"GREAT SURPRISE, WHAT A GREAT SERIES, TIES IN HISTORY WITH THE SUPERNATURAL, THE GUY WHO PLAYS ICHABOD CRANE IS AWESOME, HIS INFLECTION IN HIS ENGLISH ACCENT IS PERFECT, IT MAKES YOU WISH PEOPLE STILL SPOKE THAT WAY, WATCH IT, YOU WILL BE HOOKED",Positive
I've watched 5 seasons so why not try the 6th for $8. It's still not good and e story line never develops like other shoes that have been on this long. They really need to shake things up,Negative
I title this in this way because the episode fluctuates back and forth.  Characters have their strong points and weak ones in this episode.  Although I like the series as a whole I thought this episode had its drawbacks but the viewer is the judge and not a tv critic.  The series itself though is very good I recommend anyone to stick with it.,Negative
Hoping for laughs and learning - not my style of humor and learning too little for time invested. Some younger may like it.,Negative
I really enjoy seeing the self sustaining lifestyle of the Kilcher family.  The  hunting scenes are always tempered with respectful taking of a life.  The scenery is magnificent..  Seeing people who choose to live without running water and what life with outhouses in -20 degrees is a learning experience.  I really enjoyed this program!!!!..,Positive
"It would be better if they didn't argue so much!  It's that macho man thing men have going on.  I am better than you so I need to kick you when your down.I liked it at first, but their attitudes really get old after a while.  You want to just tell them to grow up or shut up.",Negative

"This first season is very good. The backstage goings on is always enjoyable to see. With the back-stabbing and gossip, you could almost imagine that that really happens.",Positive
Good British drama series.  Good Start for Season 1 and I was impressed with Helen Mirren's character both personal and work related.,Positive
"I thought it was a good and contraversial doctramentary. After watching it I went out and bought lots of beef to go back to eating what I used to eat when I was a kid growing up and as a teen ager and as a young man. Back when I was 145 pounds and could lift in free weights on the bench press of 315 pounds and leg lifted 1,000 pounds. Today I weigh just under 300 pounds and can not bench press even 200 pounds. I began eating what some say is a good diet of the food peramid back after high school and after military service, with lots of Vitamin D milk and my health went down hill quickly. I believe in the all meat diet. However, now days meat is so expensive to buy. Yet medical bills are even more expensive. (take your choice) medical bills or expensive meats and a better way of life. Great movie. I wanted to buy a DVD or 4 so I could spread the news of a better way to eat. Thanks.",Positive

Saw some episodes when it was on TV but missed the rest. Good build of characters. Great story line. Worth the watch.,Positive
"This show lacks originality, the movement of the storyline is weak, the characters are not engaging, and the special effects would be ok for cutscenes in a 90s videogame.  It feels like a typical tv series that doesn't stand out in anyway.  I apologize for suggesting that a 7 year old couldn't write a better show, I know plenty that could.",Negative
"V/H/S (Adam Wingard et al., 2012)Everyone and their mothers has already weighed in on V/H/S, and they have all said the same thing: ""it's too damn long."" Add my voice to the chorus; this is a two-hour movie that should have been 1:40 tops. Bloody-disgusting's Brad Miska, who put the whole thing together, didn't feel the need (or have the know-how, I'm not sure which) to cut this down to a length where it would have worked. That's a shame, because a number of talented directors turned in halfway decent work here, and some of it would have benefitted from a bit of trimming.First off, there's Adam Wingard's framing device, ""Tape 56."" This had the most egregious material; we could have easily lost half of the beginning segment without losing anything from the movie at all. The story involves a bunch of roustabouts who break into a house in order to steal a videotape; they find the owner dead and a whole lot of tapes, and have no idea which one they're supposed to grab, necessitating them watching a whole lot of them.Then comes ""Amateur Night"", directed by David Bruckner (The Signal). Given how much I enjoyed The Signal, I'm disappointed to report this is the weakest entry in the lot, lacking Bruckner's humor and insight; it could have easily found its way to the cutting room floor complete. Bruckner does good work, he just didn't do it here.""Second Honeymoon"" is the entry from Ti West (The House of the Devil), the most accomplished filmmaker of the bunch. And up until the final few minutes, this tale of a married couple being stalked by a mysterious figure on a roadtrip is the best of the bunch; unfortunately, the ""twist"" ending is just ludicrous. While the rest of the short is of Innkeepers quality, the ending is The Roost quality. And Ti West is a filmmaker who should never, ever go back and revisit his roots.Then comes Glenn McQuaid (I Sell the Dead)'s ""Tuesday the 17th"", in which a group of friends goes out to the woods to have a good time and finds themselves stalked by a seemingly otherworldly serial killer. It's not a bad concept, and it's not bad execution, though it's nowhere near as good as I Sell the Dead, McQuaid's sole feature-length release to date. This is one where judicious editing could have helped, but given the rest of the segments here, this one comes off as middle-of-the-road; it's not great, but it's not as bad as a few of these.Next, ""The Sick Thing that Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"", helmed by Joe Swanberg (the male lead in ""Second Honeymoon""); this is the one where it's most obvious a firmer hand in the cutting room would have been a great idea. Trimmed by even a few minutes, especially at the end, this would have easily been the movie's creepiest, most effective tale, about a girl who believes her apartment is haunted, told completely through Skype sessions with her husband, who's away on business. Excellent stuff that suffers from a lack of pacing throughout and a truly weak ending (had it stopped about three minutes before it does, it would have had much greater impact). Swanberg (Kissing on the Mouth) is a director with a great deal of potential, but like any director, he needs to get the right crew working with him, and he didn't have the right editor on this one.Finally, the four-man team known as Radio Silence turn in ""10/31/98"", the best short here, about a group of friends who misread the address on an invitation and end up going to the wrong house indeed looking for a Halloween party. These guys did their own editorial work, and they did it very well; this is the best-paced segment of the bunch by far (though it probably still could have lost a minute or two towards the beginning), tight, funny when it's supposed to be and tense the rest of the time. A little predictable once you get to the meat of the story, but the journey, not the destination, is the thing here.It certainly doesn't live up to all the hype, and I sincerely hope Miska, who is already wrapping up the sequel (S-VHS), learned from the mistakes that were made with this one. On the other hand, it's not as bad as you've heard, if you ignore the hype and go into it with no expectations. It certainly could have been miles worse. ** ",Negative
"Like most of the comments say,there is no substance,just eye candy.Like my parents used to say,if you want to watch something,watch a show where you can learn something from/that has a moral story.Most shows these days are glorifying pre-marital sex.In the real world,there are kids having kids,different daddies.But to each her own.",Negative
"I don't know what keeps me watching this series, because I know the outcome. I truly enjoy the actors' performances. I've not heard of any of them. The story lines are always good vs. evil, but the journey from one side to the other is always interesting. .",Positive
"Robert E. Howard's most celebrated swordsman is indisputably Conan the Barbarian, but just because the brooding Cimmerian towers above the rest of Howard's sword & sorcery pulp heroes doesn't mean these other characters aren't worth a look. Two such strapping blokes immediately come to mind: Kull the Conqueror and Solomon Kane. In his brief span of life Howard imagined some truly dark heroes, but none more dark and bleak than this morose 17th Century Puritan. Solomon Kane is the most complex character Howard would construct.His soul damned for past acts of murder and rapacity, Solomon Kane now strives for redemption, has embarked on a life of peace and non-violence. But when darkness once more stalks the land, Kane must take up his sword and his genius for gristly battle. He dons that trademark big-brimmed Puritan's slouch hat. We learn how he ends up with that hat. This, after all, is his origin story.It's a polished, top drawer production, I'll tell the world. Most tellingly, Writer / Director Michael J. Bassett manages to capture onscreen the dark atmosphere so rife in those Solomon Kane exploits published many decades ago in WEIRD TALES, the classic pulp magazine. Solomon Kane, seeking salvation, negotiates a terrifying world inhabited by infernal forces. The sole bright spot in this damned man's life manifests in the shape of a traveling Puritan family that takes in an injured Kane. The viewer will have seen this coming: It's inevitable that Solomon Kane's dark nature would render these good people vulnerable to predation from fiendish powers. Kane remarks to the family's patriarch: ""My soul is damned. Satan's creatures would take me should I stray from the path of peace."" Me, I would've tore the hell out of there, upon hearing such confession. Except, in the wake of impending tragedy, Solomon Kane at last sees a way to undamn his soul. Save the cheerlea- er, save the Puritan girl... save the world.James Purefoy assumes a dour demeanor and is magnificent, breathing life and dimension into the grim Puritan. The crucial moment was always gonna be how convincing Purefoy would look once we see him in that black cloak and big hat and wielding the sword and blasting away with his brace of flintlock pistols. It's gratifying to see Purefoy pulling it off so well. I don't know that I've ever seen him in action roles before, but he is a natural. He certainly has the physical presence. He cleaves thru bone and gristle with bloody conviction. Tell me it's not a brilliant moment of assownery when Purefoy surrenders his vow of peace and growls to Satan's minions: ""If I kill you, I am bound for Hell. It is a price I shall gladly pay.""SOLOMON KANE is graced with a solid supporting cast that includes Max Von Sydow, a sense of desolation that drives the mood, eye-catching compositions and sleek special effects (love the scene in which demons erupt from the mirrors), and an intense James Purefoy. Michael J. Bassett's hope is that this is the first in an epic trilogy, and he really is off to a fantastic start. The Puritan's work is still far from done. To quote the damn fugly witch in this movie: ""All the Devil's children are free to walk the earth now."" But the Devil's children would do well not to bump into men with big buckled hats and somber dispositions.The DVD's bonus material: The Making of SOLOMON KANE featurette (00:04:23 minutes long); interviews with actors James Purefoy, Pete Postlethwaite, Max Von Sydow, Rachel Hurd-Wood, and director Michael J. Bassett; clips from the film - note that these aren't deleted or extended scenes (00:05:42); the trailer; and ""B-Roll,"" which basically is behind-the-scenes footage (00:20:01).",Positive
Enjoyed the whole run of the series. Good ending to the shows. I really enjoyed the acting and the stories.,Positive
"This is a well written, well directed, and well acted series. It is fun, witty, intelligent and does not assume its audience is ignorant. It does not rely of site gags but rather intelligence and has the audience be part of the show and not just mindless observers. I would recommend this series to anyone who truly enjoys intelligent heartwarming comedy.",Positive
I had gotten bored with the last couple of seasons.  With this being the last one I thought I'd check it out.  And it's really good.  Coming to be a good send off however it ends.,Positive
Never thought I liked Sci Fi.  This is very smart! Good acting and good plot development with lots of twists,Positive
"The show is what it is, no comment on that. I enjoy it, and will keep watching it.HOWEVER, this past episode (season 4, episode 10) Amazon introduced an ad. A little itty bitty one, for another video series. But it was enough. I pay for these, so I don't get advertised to. I will not continue buying them if they have ads in them. Period. I sent feedback. I hope others do too, to discourage what is beginning, and will certainly only become a trend and get worse. (You will eventually see product ads if we tolerate this).",Negative
This show is just freakin' hilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will make you laugh out loud!,Positive
"its top gear, the greatest car show........ in the world. I love the way the kick the crap out of their cars. this season a lot of their staged scenes were a little more obvious but it is still awesome to watch.",Positive
"The show was a little slow starting the season off,but by the end really had me hooked.  I can't wait to see what happens in the next season.  This Green Arrow is far different than what was portrayed in Smallville, which is a good thing.  I did like the Smallville version, but this is its own show making its own path, and if the audience and network give it a chance, I can see a long running of the series.  So far, the villains are regular villains, not superpowered for the most part (although there are some highly skilled opponents of course).  I know very little about the comic book version so I don't know how long time fans of his will feel, but I definitely recommend this show.",Positive
love top gear. there is really nothing to say but there are fast unbelievable cars being driven around recklessly. stupid ideas of children are played out in well stocked and well funded garages. and i cant get enough of it. make as many shows as you can and i will purchase them all :-) lol,Positive
"I was a little worried, for just a moment, about the treatment of the show having any pathos in it. But it doesn't; it's clever. There are some great comedic lines, and MJF has the same great delivery we (speaking for those of us who are from the same era) grew up loving.I like the character of Annie; I know some people have said that they don't. But I think it's believably played.I don't really like any of the children, sorry. They're okay, but I don't enjoy their screen time, particularly.I do enjoy the honest self-jabs that are sprinkled in, e.g. when introduced to his pixie-sized assistant, he says something like, ""Thank you for getting someone shorter than me."" Funny.I've enjoyed the episodes so far; I don't know if it's a survivor. But I'm just glad to see MJF back doing what we like him doing.",Positive
"Brilliantly written, masterfully performed and profoundly developed as a whole. Every aspect of this show produces a fun break from the day to day. I look forward to watching these shows each week and am delighted to be able to obtain them on my kindle fire so I can rewatch them, as time permits, throughout the summer break.",Positive
"In  a way this Series seems to be about the ends days of our time, and hope after the battle is over. At least that's the impression I get.",Positive
"I love the show, but, family out of state does not get that channel.  I brought the first two seasons and know they are going to love it.",Positive
Wonderful. Loved it.,Positive
"I found the movie very entertaining and engaging. You're watching the story play out and routing all the time for a guy trying to get away with manslaughter and fraud!  But beyond this, it lets you feel like you gain some insight into the way big money in the business world works - or could work - or at least probably has worked before.  I didn't mind the movie's seeming ending in mid-sentence.  Perhaps all that needed to be said had been said.  The movie chose its path and followed it to an acceptable conclusion both for the characters and for the viewer who is left with something to think about.  It was kind of a ""happy ending"", kind of an ""unfinished ending"" - but is there ever a finish to any story?  Some reviewers mention wanting to see him get nailed, but in a way, he is - by his wife.  The ""punishment"" he receives from her however is probably much more productive and beneficial to society than just having him spend time in jail.  While the movie was high-budget, high-gloss modern film-making, it ended like a noir or something out of the New Hollywood era of films made in the early 70s which often cut-off mid-sentence and made no apologies about it.  None needed here either really. In ending where it does, it doesn't try and force things - and it makes its point without having to.  What we're left with is a man about to donate a great amount of money to charity.. and for those that know nothing of the man's real story, he will go down in history as a great humanitarian.",Positive
"So far so good as I find this series to be quite entertaining and I look forward to each Friday for the next episode.  Pretty good acting overall, but a few tongue in cheek moments to keep it from becoming a &#34;Great&#34; series.  Interesting characters that play pretty well against each other.  And since I've not read the book I'll probably keep watching just to see where the hell this dome actually came from and its purpose around this town.",Positive
I haven't been disappointed yet with this series. Wonderful scientists with a great ability to bring the information into our reality.,Positive
"I suppose that if one watches one episode a week....it would not be the case, but when watching episodes in fairly rapid succession, the subject gets quite boring.  I actually stopped watching without finishing the season.  Just got to be too predictable.",Negative

I love the story line. The professer is played wonderfully by Eric McCormack. Sad the season ended Looking forward to next year.,Positive

These are the kind of replays that are always entertaining for the whole family. Enjoyable and good to relax in front of.,Positive
"Good ensemble chemistry results in a well acted political farce. The script could be much better if it relied less on broad stereotypes. Overall, good acting aided by crisp direction, and technical support, trumps a less than stellar script. Fun to watch and recommended as a light entertainment.",Positive
"I started watching this show on Netflix..and thank goodness for Amazon, was able to play &#34; catch-up &#34; in time for the new season. Though I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, this shows concept is interesting..and it keeps you on your &#34; viewing toes &#34; with its waffling between &#34; time periods &#34; Unlike some sci-fi shows, your interest is held & you are anxious to see where it goes next.",Positive
"Therefore, the movie ended well. I would not have wanted to consider a happy ending.  Not with all the wrongdoings that took place.  He was just at a point of exhale.  Richard Gere's character may have died from the injuries of the car accident.  All left to the imagination of the viewer, yet one clear thing is when money is not earned the fair way, there are consequences.  This movie was well-written, well-crafted, and right-on with today's world.  Great acting.  Great production.  Great directing.",Positive
"SPOILER ALERTWas preparing to give this 5 stars up until the final 3 minutes. In the final minutes they did the predictable thing and resorted to the tired and way over used ""Cliff Hanger"" ending. Really disappointing. This was a great 15 episode story. Like a great book, it should have had a great ending with some finality to it. Instead, leaving both Hardy and Claire stabbed and bleeding on the floor was nothing more than an unimaginative hook to get people to tune in for season 2.There is no rule that says that all stories have to have a happy ending. The series 24 proved that for 7 of their 8 seasonS. Just wish that the writers and producers of The Following had more confidence in their own abilities and NOT have to resort to this type of cheap theatrics.That having been said, 999% of the series was extremely engaging and entertaining. A real thriller. Bacon and Purefoy were amazing in their roles.",Positive
I started watching on t.v. & it is just my kind of show. Not having cable or satellite service any longer...I am able to watch on here. Catching up and will watch all that is offered.,Positive
"For some reason the writers stories never seem to get tired.  Every season the suspense is still there mixed with just the right amount of individual awareness and humor.  It is the only show I'll watch.  Excellent.Amazon has some work to do on there video access.  I get a number of errors about playing multiple videos at the same time which I am not and on occasion the HD delivery doesn't seem to be the highest quality.  However, I have just downloaded Amazon's Video Access application for my iPad and I'm anxious to try it to see if it works well.  This is what cloud computing is all about - right?",Positive
"By now most people have been watching the show so going into specifics would bore you, and if you have not seen it, I might spoil it for you. So I'll keep it short. I have always thought James Spader was a great actor. I think you give him any role and this guy can elevate it.  I cant imagine anyone else for this role. For those who have not seen any of it yet, I would say watch the first three shows, if your not hooked by then? It just may not be for you.  You have the FBI, And the CIA involved so you get a lot of action scenes, you have Spaders character and another character Lizzy who is a government official, and the show revolves around these two characters. I am telling you, look at other reviews, you have mystery, plots that twist and turn, tons of questions that just keep you guessing and wanting more, and the week does not go fast enough so you can watch what happens next. You have an all star cast, But Spader really is a powerful character in this show, and I would say he even holds back a little, meaning his presence could be so powerful that the other characters could get swallowed up by him. But the writers and Spader leave plenty of room for you to connect with the other characters.  If you love mystery novels or shows, DRAMA for sure, absolutely perfect writing, and there is no one particular story line. There are so many different story's, so many twists, you never know which road your on until they want you to know, and you know they are just leading you on this roller coaster of emotions during the telling of this mystery of a story. There are so many parts, and eventually most likely at the end of the series, everything will be tied up before they call it quits. But the ride to get there is going to be one of the most entertaining and on the edge of your seat rides you will be on while you watch this show. I say give this a chance. Watch it through 3 episodes and see what you think.  If you look, you will see most people love this show. I watch the Following, and I am a loyal fan of that show. And I am a huge fan of Kevin Bacon's movies, but the Blacklist is just number 1 in my book. You find out what the Blacklist is very early on, as in the first or second episode.  Start from the beginning, and Most will not be able to stop. You will either catch up with season 1 which has ended, on Amazon or you will order the DVD.  This is a show that does not come along very often.  Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, Friends, Cheers, Seinfeld, Mash, and I can go on. This show is one of those. Just different material.  You would be missing out on something really special with this show. Give it a shot. You wont be sorry.  I guess you can call it a crime Drama, with a ton of mystery that you only find out a little at a time. Enjoy.....",Positive
"My seven year old thought there were too many bees and said she did not want to see any more episodes. As short as it was, she lost interest midway. What I did like about it is the the kids using  their brains and imagination. What I didn't like about it was the visual of nerd kids wearing glasses, snarky girls are blondes and bullies are big thugs. I would have like to have seen a different angle or look for all these kids.",Negative
"Universal Soldier:Day of Reckoning(released Oct/12)has Jean-Claude Van Damme as Luc Deveraux and Dolph Lundgren as Andrew Scott,back in their previous roles.Joining them in the drivers seat is Scott Adkins as John.Scott plays a hard driving and relentless character here,something in the vein of Jason Statham,as a man on a mission.The story finds Scott being woken up by his daughter claiming there are monsters in the house.When he reaches the kitchen he is repeatedly knocked down by a masked man with a crowbar.After a short time both his wife and daughter are also brought down to the kitchen and are executed before his eyes,by a man who reveals himself as van Damme.Nine months later he awakes in a hospital(the fact that a ""nurse"" who feeds him while he is in bed,then checks him out behind a desk,would lead one to think this is more than just a hospital).He is interviewed by a man claiming he is an FBI agent and to call him if he thinks of anything related to the murders,which of course are indelibly etched in his mind.Time passes and Scott is indeed released and he goes home to try and find himself.He receives a phone call from a nervous man who knows him and has something for him.When Scott arrives the man is dead.He spots a matchbook on a table with the name of a club on it and heads there and meets up with a girl who knows him,but not visa versa.He gets kicked out but later follows her to her apartment.She has known Scott for quite awhile and has been afraid of his terrible temper,relating a story of beating a man to death.While there a man barges in on them and tries to kill Scott.They both escape but are followed and end the fight in a sporting goods store.Meanwhile we see that Van Damme is the leader of a Unisol resistance movement and Lundgren is his second lieutenant,if you will.They are trying to free all former and current Unisols from their bondage from the government.It seems Scott is a Unisol,so bred to infiltrate the new Unisol movement and kill Van Damme;though he doesn't know it yet.Scott eventually manages to find the Unisol hideout where they try and remove his implanted memory of his wife and daughter's murders.Something goes wrong while in the chair and he frees himself,kills the lab techs and systematically fights his way through.He dispatches each with particularly devastating skill until he meets with Lundgren.He gives Scott a good run for the money,but Scott comes out victorious.Then it's on to Van Damme.Van Damme and Scott go toe to toe and it all ends there.The film comes to its conclusion as Scott meets up with the FBI agent,who explains that Scott was bred just to kill Van Damme.No one before had succeeded until now.Blaming him for his wife's death,Scott shoots the agent.Anticipating his reaction,out of a nearby van steps out the same agent,then other Unisols,to take away the dead clone(?).I must say off the top I cannot fault Scott Adkins acting,as he plays his part very well.He wears the part of a confused man,trying to find himself but filled with revenge,like a tee shirt.Unlike the last poor installment,this fourth Universal Soldier(there were two others without Van Damme and company)is much better plot wise and in pace.But someone has to tell me: 1)where in the heck is the franchise going?2)where did it go wrong?and 3)why does van Damme and company continue down this strange road? The first one had Van Damme as a Unisol who in the end snaps out of who and what he is.In the second he is totally in control of himself and has a daughter and even assists with work in the lab.For all intents and purposes he is totally a near normal guy.The last one,after all the time in between,brings Van Damme back as a non speaking drone,who seeing Lundgren,battles it out with him once more.No explanation given whatsoever as to why Van Damme is now a Unisol again.And now they continue in the same very dark vein,but things have obviously evolved and Van Damme is now the leader of a resistance movement,with a shaved head.Watch that head,because when Adkins has his final showdown,JCVD has his head painted white and black! I know this emphasizes where Van Dammes character has ""gone"",but it's all totally nonsensical stuff in the bigger context.Plot wise,I can see Reckoning as the second installment and the second as the third.The real third installment,well I cannot see it period.My point is neither of these newer Universal Soldier movies are in keeping plot or character wise,with what went on in the first two.So,how in God's creation did we get here and why do they continue down the same dreadful and inexplicable path? I might add,though Van Damme appears here more than the third(which was pitifully small),he appears not MUCH more.JC and Dolph's appearance's are just glorified cameos!Oh yes,watch for Van Damme's son in a bit part as an ""FBI"" agent in the ""hospital"".Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include interviews with Lundgren,Adkins,Van Damme and director Hyams.All in all while much better than the third installment,this film again sees the entire cast and crew deviating as far away from any connection with the first two movies as they can possibly go.I suggest if you have the first two watch them again,and if you haven't buy or rent them.Then you maybe can explain to me this total digression in characterization and warping of the franchise as a whole.",Negative
"This show is my Husband's favorite.  NOt only does he watch it intensly, he actually puts into practice what the wise man says and it has helped him change many bad and unhealthy habits.  It took him to hear it from a man (rather than his wife).  At any rate, I am thrilled.  My Darling Hubby has been cooking more often (which thrills me) and has lost 30 pounds. YEA Good Eats!",Positive
Not the greatest show I've ever seen but I'd watch more of them if they make more.  I'm a fan of The Onion News.  This wasn't as entertaining as there normal stuff.  It could use a little more work to be really good.,Positive
"Initially I didn't like this show, but I kept watching and in spite of the Clint Eastwood deadpan and raspy voice of John that sometimes slips into the 'pluck the pebble from my hand' kung fu sound, the rainman quality of Harold, and the occasional weird...perhaps psychopathic personalities of almost everyone on the show, it has grown on me.",Positive
"I almost did not watch this show, I am happy that I did. The show has passion, a lust for music and a sensual connection, it kind of plays with the imagination which positions you in the mood for more. Truly recommend, have a sensational time watching this show. Cannot wait to see how the season lays out.",Positive

"I gave this series two stars to be kind.  It has very little if any redeeming value to it.  Those that like to see borderline pornography may enjoy he series but I am not one of those people.

"Ah, the infamous Escape From Tomorrow! It was hyped, it made the news, it has an incredible gimmick, and lots o' people wanted to see it.  Well, you gotta admit, it was a pretty ballsy venture-guerilla film making that brings to mind the grindhouse schlockmeisters of yesteryear.  Gotta give it an A for effort anyhow.But is it a good movie?  Or, like The Human Centipede, is it just hanging on a gimmick?  Well, that's kinda hard for me to say.  First off, this is a movie that obviously wasn't made with the mainstream audience in mind.  This is apparent right from the start.  Hell, the black and white photography seals that deal right away.  But add to that, that this is one of those bizarro, mind bending, Eraserhead-ish kinda movies.  That will certainly thin out the audience.I'd say steer clear of this film unless you dig movies from the other side of the fence.  If you like David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and directors of that nature, you might wanna give it a shot.  I'm not comparing this movie to the films of those directors necessarily, but I'm saying that if you like those kinds of directors, you're probably a little more open minded to more oddball films like this one.  That's no guarantee you'll like it though.This movie wasn't perfect, but I will say that I enjoyed it.  It starts out strong with a scene in the It's A Small World ride that has the animatronic puppets sporting demonic faces.  Unfortunately the movie doesn't really follow through with this tone.  The wacky stuff that gets this film labelled as a horror movie(not a very accurate description) is pretty much in the final act.  The bulk of the movie has the father pursuing two teen girls through the park, as well as many scenes on the park rides(no doubt to exploit the secretly shot footage of Disney World).  It does drag a bit.  In fact, in a 90 plus minute movie, you end up only remembering maybe 30 minutes of it.  If it had sprinkled more of the craziness of that early scene throughout instead of waiting til the tail end, it would have been-maybe not a BETTER movie-but a bit more interesting anyway.  But don't get me wrong, there is definitely some crazy s%$t going on here when the movie lets loose!There's really not much more to say about it.  It's a &#34;love it or hate it&#34; kinda deal if I ever saw one.  But on my end, I did find myself enjoying it, and again, I respect it.  In fact, I'd say that I respect the film more than I enjoyed it, if that makes sense.",Positive
"I can't see myself going out of my way to watch this one like I would for The After, Bosch, or The Rebels.  Everything's good about it but the overall topic - classical music is a snoozer.  I do like the characters and the story line so far though.",Negative
This is one of the best series I've seen.  It's great to watch the streaming so I can watch episodes when I want.  The premise is different from all the usual cop shows.  The acting is good.  I like the characters.  Each episode has a complete case plus something is added to the backstory.,Positive
A show which can put you to sleep if you can.t sleep. Will keep trying but............we will see how it goes,Negative
"This one is on a par with 'Sherlock'. It keeps you wondering and addicted. There's a lot going on and it's fun to follow. Funny and intellectual..The characters are so different. On the one hand you find yourself almost hating Louis..but then he has this very tender side. The relationship between Donna and Harvey is unusual, and Rachel is wonderful in her part with Mike. The women are knockout gorgeous and the clothes are to die for!!! I am almost at the end of the third season and i can't get enough!! Watched it all within three days holed up!!!",Positive
"I was looking for a good horror movie, that fell under the radar, to promote for halloween, and I was told that the Innkeepers was that film, but it wasn't. This film is so clique, stealing almost everything from other films of the same genre. They had the nerve to give this movie an R rating and call it the must see horror movie of the year, but truthfully, its slightly more scary than a Disney movie! An old hotel is going out of business and the two remaining employees decide to investigate the long history of ghost sightings at the establishment. There are only a couple guests, giving them the perfect opportunity to investigate. The only thing this film uses in order to frighten you is random things jumping out at you, which most of the time aren't what you expect them to be. There is also a creepy old woman staying there who can talk to the spirits and predict the future, but if that isn't bad enough, there is of course the investigations themselves. Using nothing but a s***ty old tape recorder, they go looking for EVPs, using every phrase and question they could steal from Ghost Hunters. Yeah, the Innkeepers really is that ridiculous and the only really shocking thing about this movie is that someone actually gave it an R rating! Was the MPAA associate a little girl or elderly woman, because honestly, Monster House was scarier than this thing was.",Negative

"I love teen mom 2 . My youngest daughter got me interested in watching it. I think that Kailyn is the petty one here and not Jo. I think that she expects too much from him!! I also think that Janelle is another screwball along with her mother,Barbara. Chelsey is always whining and Leah is probably the most mature out of the group. I just can't help watching though to see what happens next.",Positive
"Little Britain can be insanely funny though a few of the recurring characters get revisited a tad too often for me.  I tend to watch series online or by DVD so I get them in clumps which is a great way to watch serial shows but can make skit shows less funny over a marathon.  When you first watch you may find the narrator's voice to be familiar, Tom Baker does voice over work here in the US and he was one of the The Doctors.  The leads/writers are brilliant and if you watch the DVD then view the extras, Lucas in particular is an interesting person.  Walliams swam the Channel for charity.",Positive
I watched this because I really like the original Dance Moms with Abby Lee Miller.  This is about a dance studio taught by 2 guys and it is enjoyable.  I think the original Dance Moms is better but this show was with an interesting cast of characters in it.  If you like Dance Moms you will enjoy this show,Positive
"The brilliant Agatha Christie's &#34;Poirot&#34; and David Suchet were made for each other! They started out as great and grew into fabulous, as did Christie's characters. Suchet makes the formerly somewhat stuffy Poirot, especially as depicted in old movies, not as endearing as he is in these Masterpiece Theatre creations which make you want to invite this little man into your home and watch his &#34;little gray cells&#34; go to work. The series just gets better and better. My third wish is that it could go on forever. it is so good.",Positive
"Even though it's basically Nashville for the orchestra goer, it does present wonderful music with an interesting background drama.  The acting by the younger actors are a bit over stated.  This was more than made up for by the intensity and polish of the veterans.",Positive
"Twisty-turney plot line, sometimes tedious, sometimes predictable, but the surprises and good acting keep me coming back. I'm as hooked on this show as I am on Grey's Anatomy. Shonda Rhymes must be a creativity machine.",Positive
"I loved this show. Most of the lower rated reviews were made because the sensitive  people who wrote them have thin skin and thought that this show was making fun of Republicans. It pokes fun a little, but it is a cute humor and not over the top and doesn't cross the line. It was really funny! I think if they replaced the word ""republican"" with a fake party name it would be received better, but lose some of the ironic humor.",Positive
"Don't know if they can sustain such a smart and intense storyline but the pilot episode was pretty awesome for an action-drama thriller.  Thought provoking, complex, and fast-paced with a lot of mysterious plot points and characters.  Let's hope they build from here and not taper off to hum-drum land. The pilot ep is a must-watch.",Positive
"If you are interested in history, this is a good show. Maybe sometimes, too many negative things. Fast moving. Easy 22 minutes.",Positive
"I watched this short video out of shear boredom one weekend and found that, though not a great film, it was sort of interesting. Yes, it does have sort of a Firefly vibe, at least as far as the setting (old scrungy spaceship). The central characters were fairly well acted, though some of the supporting actors were wooden and lifeless. Other reviewers have raved about the surprise at the end. Maybe I just watch/read too much SF because I guessed what was coming in the first 5 minutes, but don't let that ruin your enjoyment. Enigma is worth a free viewing on a rainy weekend.",Negative
"If you like season one of dance moms, this season starts up with a bang and raises the silly caddyness to a whole new level. It is really quite fantastic-shameless reality at its best. If you do not like reality tv, definitely skip it. If you love reality tv but it right now!!!",Positive
The story line is getting more interesting BUT way too much unnecessary gore!  Not sue why they feel the need to directly show all that.,Negative
"Not as strong as season 1, but I hope it turns around....still love the show and happy with the purchase",Positive
The storyline was no surprise though I kept watching because I just wanted to see what man would be Natalie's nemesis in the show.  Held out to the end to reveal.  I would watch more of it to see how the story develops but they need more characters you can care about.,Negative
I gave this  five stars due to &#34;The Angels Take Manahattan.  This was a most interesting episode and made the whole season worth watching.,Positive
"I really like that the fire house story line is blended with a bit of humor, and the script is not simply &#34;house on fire.&#34; There are many types of rescue and plenty of tension.",Positive
It is one of the best mature audience animations out there.  The back and forth between characters is great.  Archer takes it another level always trying to get over and one liners are hilarious.,Positive
"Too much sex to little espionage, but, a great season with new handlers and drama. Plot seems too bogged down in logistics and short on action. The FBI agent needs to go away as does his love interest counterspy.",Positive
Julianne Moore is as good as always and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers turns in an excellent performance.  The plot was better than I expected and I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  The ending was a little clich&eacute;d but not really all that bad.,Positive
I absolutely love the series! I wait anxiously every week for the new episodes to come out. I love the twists they have created for each fairy tale and I especially like that the princesses are tough and can kick butt!,Positive
"My wife forced me to watch this series and while it will never win any awards it is a fun show, with lot and lots of twists and turns (albeit not realistic at times). You have to watch it from beginning otherwise it will make no sense.",Positive
"This is our favorite show from Amazon. We love the actors, the characters they portray and the story line. Very funny show. We want more!",Positive
"Amazon, please stop trying to make TV shows.  You are bad at it, and will lose tons of money.  This show has ugly actors, ugly production values, and they sing.  I skipped the opening song, turned it off after they broke out into another one.  Bad Amazon, bad.",Negative
Ok this whole story seems or at least is plausible for one.  Without any spoilers these are two kgb agents that were recruited when they were young and planted in american.  Want to at least get a taste of what it was like to be spy vs spy.  This is it.  The things they do in this drama/thriller and when I say thriller each episode has you on the seat of your pants because these kgb agents do so pretty incredible and resourceful gathering intelligence and doing what they do best for there country.  This is as real as it gets.  I can only watch an episode here and there because it is so edge of your seat you need a break.  It is the only one out there like it and if you enjoy spy thrillers each episode you will enjoy.  I am 7 episodes into season one and it is awesome.,Positive
"I love action packed seasons and this season ended on notes where you wanted to watch the next one! I would highly recommend this season to anyone who likes action, some gore, and even romance! :)",Positive
"This show has a lot of potential and I was interested the entire time.  The premise is fairly original.  I could see it on HBO - as a sort of darker, sexier, adult version of glee.  If you're a music lover, you'll enjoy the talent of the musicians and the art of orchestra.  I hope they stay away from all the sexual double entendres here on out - there's no need for that, the underrepresented culture of professional orchestra as a seedy, competitive, and exciting professional is very intriguing in itself.  I hope the characters remain complex, the music continues to fill the scenes, and the day-to-day situations remain relatable.  Keep them coming!  (See what I mean about sexual double entendres?  Shakespeare's time is done my friends - the world is ready for more complex word craft!)",Positive
"Fun show. I am perhaps a little outside the desire demographic, but there are some charming moments. I found the lead actor very appealing.",Positive
"I have watched all the episodes and overall I like the series. Comedy is very sketchy but not bad. I think they try too hard to make it funny. John Goodman character needs to get a little life in it, too lethargic and uninspired. aybe that's what puts a little downer sentiment to it. I wil continue to watch.",Positive
"I'm surprised at how many positive reviews this show is getting, its pure drivel.  Logic holes so big you can drive semi trucks through, horrid dialogue, pure teen formula show complete with theme music for scenes to give &#34;mood/meaning&#34;.  How something like this saw enough production to make it live is beyond me and shows just how little studios think of teenagers and the public in general.  Either that or our culture really is that bankrupt and intellectually exhausted to where shallow teenage antics are considered worthy story material no matter how stupid the presentation.  I could go on, but you really are wasting precious minutes of your life watching this.",Negative
"Although the premise isn't one I would normally watch, I have to say the last scene had me hooked. I wanted to know what happened in the next five minutes. That being said, I don't know that i could watch an entire season of this. The characters yelled at each other or talked over each other too much for the dialog to be enjoyable.",Negative
modern take on a western sheriff&#8230;really quite well done given that it is just an hour long procedural.,Positive
This is one really well done show. I love that all the supporting actors from The Closer were kept for this show as I love each and every one of them. It is a well acted and fun show to watch. I love Mary Mc Donnell and all the cast. I didn't think it would be as good without Brenda Lee but it is and I highly recommend it anyone looking for a good drama show to watch.,Positive
"The concept is ok but the writing needs to improve. I don't mind an occasional F bomb but they were dropping like operation RollingThunder and they were not believable,, No one cusses like that!!

"I was really into this show for the first few episodes.  It was fun, engaging, shocking.  But it started to sag in the middle.  This show would have probably been better were it on FX or another network, where they could have crafted a tighter arc.",Negative
This show is about various killers and people you don't want to know or touch with a ten foot pole.  Horrifyingly fun to watch though.  Like something from another planet. Everybody needs killing.,Positive
"I think Fiction requires at least a little plausibility to work and frankly I couldn't see the group in this movie surviving a power outage, not to mention that even the most innocuous situation seems to provoke a 5-minute discussion (at times I felt like I was watching a Woody Allen film).  Discordant strings and chaotic cameras try to force thrilling atmospheres during the following anticlimaxes: the alpha-nerd discovers a slashed tire, a girl with some blood on her appears at the door (sending one of the quintet into borderline shock), the mysterious visitor subsequently locks them out of their cabin (oh the humanity!).  OMG, you gotta love the 8 minute, not-so-riveting argument on whether to go out into the dark night and find one of the team where they finally convince his wife to wait till morning by saying ""please... help us get Doug back"" (*camera zooms in on bewildered wife, mouth agape while crickets chirp gleefully in the background*).Featuring the most spineless, indecisive and petty, horror-movie-victim groups of all time hunted by a slasher of epically lame proportions (ooooo... his eyes are milky-white... s.s..scarrrry) ""The Killing of Jacob Marr"" comprises 1 hour/51 minutes of pure, cinematic flatulence.  Somebody light a match.  :o)",Negative
I loved Vera.  A very human person dealing with her personal life and solving complicated crimes.  Vera deals with the death of her father - whom she has a complicated relationship with - and actually moves into his home.  She discards the remnants of his life - dead animals - and makes his home HER home.  I loved Vera.  Her sidekick is perfect - he supports her because he knows how brilliant Vera is.  Amazing woman.  I love her. She is everywoman.,Positive
reviewed volume 6 got 7 for the same reasons my 2 year old grandson loves the shows and on the go it is perfect for keeping him contient.,Positive
"How could I best describe D13-U? Not quite easy, despite being an easy viewing. Action-packed, yes. Quite funny at times. An interesting plot dealing with deception and political machinations (one of the few movies with that theme that I could actually understand it pretty well). Pretty well-balanced, at least in my opinion. And, overall, worth checking out.There's not much I could say about it that wouldn't ruin plot points and all, yet I didn't see the first movie, though I did enjoy how this one went.So, the best I could do is a recommendation: if you like fast action, a great-paced movie, a foreign film, numerous twists and deep thought to the twists, and realistic fight scenes, and an eventual cast of eccentric people (including a woman who knows how to fight with her hair as a deadly whip) in the mix and a surprise twist at the end, this could definitely be for you.",Positive
I have really gotten into this series. It's very intense at times and shows the corruption that Chicago is famous for. It really gives you some insights into Obama and his minions.,Positive
"Watching the modern Doctor Who one-off specials has certainly become an unexpected Christmas tradition in our home. And each Doctor brings his own spin to the holiday themed episodes. Last year Matt Smith's Doctor took on Dickens in an outer-space interpretation of ""A Christmas Carol."" It was frenetic and funny, managed to seamlessly blend tragedy with humor, and was emotionally satisfying without being cloying. This year, we had ""The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe"" (its central plot point borrows from a certain literature classic--I think you can figure out which one). This may well be the most straightforward and heartfelt Christmas special yet. Set in World War II era Britain, Smith helps a family adjusts to what promises to be a painful season by making a perfect getaway experience for the kids. However, with the best of intentions, one of the Doctor's surprises leads to unexpected dangers. The family must work together to ensure their very survival and get back home.The special capitalizes of an eco-friendly theme as the principle aliens within the piece are not your typical beasts. They too are a race battling to live as manmade intrusions into their environment threaten their existence and livelihood. Might the Doctor and his charges be of assistance? It is Christmas after all. Or as certain annihilation looms, might it be too late for anyone to survive? This is Doctor Who after all. The show's pacing is brisk and its storyline affirms a strong message of loyalty and family. In fact, the Doctor's exposure to the widow and her children make him contemplate those that he has left behind through the course of his exploits.While many of the past Christmas specials were completely independent, ""The Doctor, The Widow, and The Wardrobe"" actually fits comfortably into the timeline of the on-going series. With a minimum of screen time, the show's finale packs an emotional punch that really resonates and sets up future episodes. And while, in truth, the main story was pleasant enough--it is these last few minutes that really distinguish this special and make it memorable. Smith is crisp and amusing as always, but it is Claire Skinner (as the mother) that really gets some nice dramatic moments. All in all, this is a very well balanced presentation. And, especially due to the last few moments, it is one that I will remember. A solid 4 star episodes with a simple but effective 5 star finale, I'd rank this as one of the sweetest (and possibly best) Christmas specials yet. KGHarris, 12/11.",Positive
"The producers of this program really attempted to accurately portray historical events, so much so at times it was difficult to remember that the program was an reenactment.",Positive
"This is a great season. I am a huge Office fan and this season is one of my favorites. Not quite seasons 2-4, but still really good.SPOILER ALERT:This is the season you find out that Pam is pregnant, and i believe it is the season Pam and Jim get engaged. So one of the best sitcom love stories in recent memory climaxes in this season. For that plot development alone it is worth the purchase.",Positive
"I like the idea of the underdog getting that one lucky break.  After watching just a few episodes I got bored with the story.  This probably would have been better if it were a movie.  i honestly can't see it lasting too long as a TV show because there are only so many story lines available.  i thought that the actors did a great job, it was the writers and the plot that I found to be boring.",Negative
Based on childhood fairy tales.  Always different and interesting.  Good casting and acting.  Centers around Snow White & Prince Charming.  They are always fighting the bad queen-Regina.  Each week is a different story based on a fairy tale.  Very entertaining.,Positive

"Along with the last episode, there is far, far too much weight given to the bad guy. Yeah we get it. He's a sociopath murderer who gets off on power and murdering. Yeah, we get it, he manipulates people to his own end, like sociopaths do. Yeah, we get it, he wants to kill all of Rick's crew because they got over on him. Yeah, we get it, he doesn't kill to protect, that's his self delusion that justifies his serial and mass murdering sprees.It's almost like the writers have a fascination with the sociopath mind. Perhaps it's a kind of hero worship for them. Actually, it's an indication they are relying on cheap emotional thrills rather than good, solid writing. You can tell when writers have nothing else to give: They keep repeating the same old thing in a little different way to get cheap emotional thrills from viewers, hoping they will return for, yes, more cheap emotional thrills.How many times will the bad guy come back? How many more innocent good people will he murder? How many more people will he torture? How many more women will he rape? Yawn, ad infinitum.Episode Pros: Sociopath murderer kills other sociopath murderer. +1Episode cons: New sociopath murderer introduced to take the place of the old sociopath murderer, Martinez. Net sociopath gain/loss: 0New ideas: noneInteresting dilemmas: none.Good strategies: none.Philosophical dialog: none.Relation to real life problems: none.Net overall literary value: NONE!",Negative

Five stars it's one of the funniest sitcom on tv now it will literally have you laughing out loud it's a show worth watching enjoy,Positive
"Reviews are always subjective of the viewers expectations, so keep that in mind with mine and other reviewers comments.This is enjoyable overall, meaning yes I would watch it again and perhaps recommend it to selected others.  Is this a 'horror' movie? Not really.  Is it scary?  Not so much, but it does have some twists to the story line and just when you think it is predictable, you get a little surprise.I like the fresh approach to what has become a regular movie plot - friends getting together for a weekend at a (fill in the blank location of your choice here).  There could be a few less 'F' bombs tossed around as it added nothing necessary to the dialog.  I for one am thankful the production did not use a gratuitous nudity scene or typical 'bathroom' humor attempts.  A group of people in a Winter setting are not going to be prancing about in their underware (or less) so the reality of staying dressed was nice.Without giving much of anything away, let me say the story line develops nicely, you get a bit of the backstory at the beginning, the prime characters are introduced and you get just a bit here and there on them, the characters develop logically though two of them in particular have some background that is either not fully revealed, or got left on the editing room floor, it did not take away from the plot in general and is just something I found myself wondering about at the end.Movie starts, a bit of plot starts with it, and WHAM first death scene, not to graphic, just enough to make it believable...time moves ahead and the rest of the story begins as old friends (each with their own emotional baggage) get together for a ride out to a cabin, some little dramas along the way to develop character background and add a bit of mystery.  If there is an unbelievable element in all of this it has to be the lack of luggage, come on now...a weekend cabin and woods adventure and each girl has ONLY ONE small knapsack for luggage, PEA-LEEESE!As a person who spent 20 plus years in and around theater production and the movie lots (Universal Studios) I tend to look at the cinematic aspects now, including acting.  This is right along the top tier for acting and cinematography.  The actors are polished, the scenes run together with no pauses for evident line rehearsals, the eye movement is steady and focused on each other vs darting back and forth, and not obvious eye to camera avoidance, they know their stuff and you feel that you are really watching the story unfold from real life instead of, well, a movie.  Camera angles are good, though a couple of times the back and forth between actor closeup may have been better served by having them both in view at the same time.OK, back to the story...they arrive at the cabin, not all is it should be...let the mystery and killing begin...and again...and again...done well, not overkill (no pun) just enough, and thankfully the blood looks real instead of like raspberry jam.And in the end...the story comes together, complete with sequel potential, blood on the snow...yadda yadda and into the sunset.Give it a view, I think you will like this one.",Positive
"It was good.  I liked the way the trans gender thing was handled.  I know this was just the pilot, and the characters have to be defined and developed, but it was a little slow. I  Like the way it ended and would like to see what happens next, I think that will really define the show.  Good cast, Jeffery was great.",Positive

"Futurama remains the most entertaining,clever, funny and creative shows on TV today. Voice talent is superb, characterization (including Leela and Fry's unlikely on-off romance), animation is good, but it's the script and the zany explorations of ideas that really elevates this show. Of course as a result most of the dullards out in TV land don't get the show so yet again it's on the cancellation list. Have to hope that Netflix or Amazon pick them up!",Positive

"[BEWARE: The following review of ""The Asylum Blackout"" contains minor spoilers.]The title tells everything about the story. Well, apparently. In ""Asylum Blackout"" (aka ""The Incident"") George, an aspiring rock musician (Rupert Evans), is seen working as a cook at the Sans Asylum. One night, while working at the asylum's kitchen with his friends and band members Max (Kenny Doughty) and Ricky (Joseph Kennedy), there is a power failure due to a storm, and they are trapped inside the facilities with the inmates, who start attacking the guards.Director Alexandre Court&egrave;s (his feature debut) takes time in setting up the character of George - serious-minded and short of sleep - and does it very well. George is very tired and clearly needs a rest, while the story unfolds from his viewpoint. George says the riot is instigated by a certain inmate, but is it true?""Asylum Blackout"" has a few violent and gory torture scenes, but as the film's bizarre conclusion suggests, it obviously attempts to be something more than a survival horror, something more psychological. While the dimly-lit photography and stylish camerawork are effectively employed to represent the disturbing situations that surround George, there is also something wrong with the film's premise.For, in order to make the film an engrossing psychological thriller, you need, besides atmospheric photography, better narrative skills in telling the story. While watching the chaos that is going on inside the asylum, we ask ourselves: how come these security guards are inadequately armed when they are supposed to deal with violent and dangerous inmates? Why do the police take such a long time to respond?The film has potential for a more unnerving horror, but to create one you need a set-up that is more credible and intriguing.",Negative
"The fifth and final season of one of my favorite shows, &#34;Fringe&#34;. This season finds our team in 2036, trying to overthrow the Observers who have taken over our planet. 13 episodes with extras that include &#34;A farewell to Fringe&#34; - Reflections from JJ Abrams, JH Wyman and cast, episode commentary, gag reel, and unaired scenes.We have all the Fringe seasons on blu ray, even though it is readily available on Netflix and Amazon digitally. Why? Because it is important to me - I loved this show and faithfully watched it every night that it was on, from the beginning to the end. Sure, like all of JJ's shows it wandered off here and there, but the cast and the characters they played, kept it real, kept it entertaining, kept me involved. Walter, Olivia, Peter, Astro...Astrid, Nina, and yes, William Bell, are some of the most creative, well written characters to ever grace television.If you have ever watched this show and lost interest, come back. You won't be disappointed.",Positive
"One of my favorite shows ever.  How could it go wrong? Hilarious, family friendly, and always good for a laugh.",Positive
This stop action comedy was good but nothing new or exciting. It didn't help that only parts of it were completely produced.,Positive
"I didn't particularly have much sympathy for celebrities chased by photographers before watching this - after all, they chase fame, get paid millions and then whine about being recognized in public. But the documentary clearly shows the much darker side of celebrity worship, and how they are literally hounded every hour of the day in a way that simply breaks any measure of privacy, civility or reasonableness.Thousands of photographers are simply feeding an online library of celebrities looking happy, sad, drunk, angry and crazy, and these images are then resorted by media outlets to tell a soap opera version of their lives. Between the editing and Photoshop work, it's pretty clear that what is being sold as reality is just simply another fictional story running rampantly out of control.There are some excellent interviews with high profile figures and an interesting backstory into the original paparazzi. There's also some viewpoints from PR and media analysts and various media professors that ultimately leave you with an odd, sick sense that this is really the bottom of so-called journalism and surely it just can't get any worse. But when CNN is racing to quote TMZ, can it really recover?The documentary doesn't try to sympathize with celebrities or blame anyone in particular but rather explain the strange cycle that has developed between producers and consumers where they have to eat each other's tails to survive. It's very revealing and certainly makes you want to never even glance at a tabloid the next time you're waiting at the supermarket.",Positive
"I love this show for my 4 year old, you learn about so many animals facts, he is an animal expert already from watching this show.  the guys are funny, the illustrations are very cute and there is always a positive message to learn.  wide array of animals to choose from, i never get bored watching these over and over, i wish amazon would have the most current season up.",Positive
"This film begins with platitudes about opening your mind and questioning authority. Once your mind is pried open a bit, it begins to drop in quotations by neo-Marxist philosophers, Howard Zinn, pictures of leftist protest signs. It is peppered with random false statements like 'banking is based on fraud', 'genetics is destroying farmers'.This movie bothers me because it is propaganda. It's not about opening your mind, it's about reprogramming your mind. They keep telling you that you're a credulous, brainwashed sheep, and obviously they really believe that of you.The best criticism of our current economic situation that I've seen is Robert Reich's &#34;Inequality for All&#34;. I think he really gets at the root of the problem, and does not offer as solution a system that is even worse than what we have.",Negative
"Outstanding performances, excellent writers.  I saw the natural spark in Jonny Lee Miller in Eli Stone 2008.  I enjoyed his character as Jordan Chase in Dexter 2010.  But he has taken the golden ring as Sherlock.  WOW ! ! The combination of Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu is star-struck.  The only note I would add is that some of the episodes are EXTREMELY complicated when others or EXTREMELY low-keyed.  Both I really enjoy, but the complicated plots are much more interesting.  I am glad that they slowed Sherlock's speech down a bit.  He can talk so fast, I can't understand what he says.  His soft, sometimes whispered lines are great - even soft spoken, you can still hear exactly what he is saying.  GREAT SHOW ! TOP-NOTCH Entertainment.",Positive
It sort of had me in stitches at parts due to the acting and the dialogue. It wasn't for me.,Negative
This show just keeps getting better and better. All of the mythology and the season long plots are super fun to watch. And the show just keeps getting funnier without losing it's badass-dom. I love it!,Positive

"This show had a terrific opening--an American boy wakes up in a Chinese rice paddy, 32 years after he died. Excellent hook. We find out something very strange is happening in Arcadia--the dead are returning, looking just as they did (down to their clothes) when they died. There are some dark secrets/crimes emerging in the first few episodes, and the boy &#34;returned&#34; is endearing. We want that family to have a happy ending, but things may get much worse before anything about the secret of the returning dead is solved or more clearly hinted at.Enjoyable. Very good cast and acting. Interesting mystery/premise. Now, will it hold and grow and improve? We'll see.",Positive
"Yes, there are commercials in this series, but NOT throughout the episodes as many are telling you.  The commercials for other shows on fox are only at the very beginning, BEFORE the show starts, and only again AFTER the episode ends.  So, it is not like watching it on TV with a commercial every 10 minutes, so I do not know why people are saying what they are saying.  I too did not buy the show to watch what is coming up on FOX this season, but do not decide to stop purchasing these episodes because of the fear you have to sit through commercials throughout the whole show.  Just wanted to make it clear, since no one else was.Thank you!",Positive
Just love this show and have watched it from the beginning.  These people go through a lot just to make a living catching gators,Positive
"Ken Burns' production PROHIBITION is done in the traditional format of Still photos and interviews and some file footage.

"Having watched every season of the British hit ""Being Human,"" I was a bit wary of SyFy's American reinterpretation. While I'm sure that I will anger the many avid fans of the original show, I didn't fully appreciate its charms until it progressed into later seasons and got darker and more complex.  In Season One of the American version, I had a similar reaction.  Once again, I found myself thinking that this was a good show with the potential to grow into something far richer and more rewarding. The British version started as an enjoyment and turned into great television and I thought that the U.S. version had the same opportunity.  And in Season Two's thirteen new episodes, I really enjoyed the deepening seriousness of the story's plot threads.For those new to the concept of ""Being Human,"" it is perhaps one of the most unique and (let's admit it) most ridiculous ones on TV. In its outrageousness, however, it is completely irresistible! What if a ghost, a werewolf, and a vampire shared living quarters as best mates? You think the trials of tribulations of being young and attractive in the big city makes for great drama, try adding this supernatural component for a bit of fun.  But where there was much humor and lightness in introductory episodes, Season Two is looking a whole lot bleaker.Sam Witwer, as the vampire, must deal with the repercussions of last season's dramatic decisions.  He is embroiled with a former flame, clan politics, and a new penchant for blood-letting.  You get a lot more back story, a lot more depth, and Witwer has an intensity perfectly suited to the role of a tortured blood sucker. Sam Huntington (our resident werewolf), who spent much of Season One as comic relief, also has richer material to sink his teeth into.  He also starts to deal with the dynamics of werewolf politics, and the fact that he's turned his love into a beast of the night makes for some of the year's more intense confrontations.  Both Witwer and Huntington are terrific!  I'm still not as enthralled by Meaghan Rath's ghost.  Rath is an appealing and pleasant apparition, but her third of the story lines just don't intrigue me as much as the other two.  In the end, though, the three share a believable chemistry that will have you rooting for them.  In terms of the supporting cast in this season, Kristen Hager is a great counterpoint to Huntington and I liked the addition of Kyle Schmid as a past protege of Witwer.DVD Extras:The DVD release has all thirteen episodes along with some fairly unremarkable extras.  There is a ""making-of"" featurette, some behind-the-scenes interviews and (my favorite) the show's 2012 presence at Comic-Con.  I liked Season One, but I appreciate Season Two much more fully.  KGHarris, 12/12.",Positive
"To be honest, did not expect much when I started this pilot.  Great cast + politics have been attempted countless times in TV shows and movies with moderate success and often just rehashing old materials and dressing them in new and shiny packages, which get old and boring quickly.  But this one is different.  It is not dry and boring as most political shows.  It is witty and funny, with good amount of sarcasm!  It is also very well made - cable network quality and has solid character development in the first episode.  I want to see more.  Yes, there is an angle to this show, but how can you not have one when the theme is politics?!  Watch it with a color lens and for its entertainment value (and some truth serum), then it is fantastic!",Positive

"If you're a fan of the Avatar series in general, and The Legend of Korra in particular, you're going to want to pick up Book 2.  The series is starting to show a little age now, with certain themes and plot points beginning to become predictable, but the show remains very entertaining in general and still manages to throw some unexpected plot twists in there.Book 2 introduces some new lore to the Avatar, the origins and meaning of the position.  It also goes into a lot more depth on the nature of the spirit world, an important part of society for the people of this world.  Overall I found the backstory and lore to be the best part about the season, even more than the overall plot of the episodes.",Positive
my daughter loves this. she will sit and watch this and interacts with all the things that they ask you to do,Positive

"This season has the 2 biggest badasses in survivor history, Ozzy and James. They may be not the most strategic players and both get played by Parvati. Parvati is a pretty good player but not the best. She gets lucky that all the fans on the jury are obsessed with her. Amanda deserves to win the game. The fans are pretty worthless except Erik who is a pretty good player. Erik gets duped at a point and makes one of the dumbest move in survivor history. There are some early exits that are pretty disappointing. Ozzy finds an hidden immunity idol and replaces it with a stick and one of the fans finds it and thinks its the real idol.",Positive

"Quentin Tarantino thinks it's the &#34;best film of the year,&#34; which is strange because -- for all of his attention to the slick, candy-like gloss that makes a film fun to watch, he's also pretty good at things like story and subtext and characters. This film is very crisply filmed, with every scene and twitch and frame almost exquisitely composed, but the story itself is so uninspired that it puts the mind to sleep like a rich, heavily-frosted cake laced with sedatives.The title/poster gives you the impression that it's a story about three bad guys. You have a sniveling religious studies teacher who is accused of raping and murdering a series of little girls. You have a disgraced cop who has gone beyond the badge to capture him. And you have the latest little girls' father choosing to mete a little vigilante justice to find the last remains of his child (and to get some blood-soaked closure). The theme here isn't anything new: when the good guys are willing to do anything to catch and punish the bad guy, do they still remain good?In spite of every perfectly timed shot, beautifully acted nuance, and gorgeously orchestrated moment, the story itself lacks any kind of meat, despite the prevalence of burnt flesh, broken bones, and shredded skin. Probably the biggest narrative snafu is that viewers never learn why the dad and cop are so convinced that the teacher is guilty of the crimes. The movie jumps right into the back-alley beatdowns without letting us know what evidence damns this poor, balding educator, making the whole thing feel lopsided (and giving astute viewers a big clue as to what they can expect at the end -- I'm not the brightest bulb, but I still managed to figure out what the final shot would be).To take up space, the movie uses violence, goofy juxtapositions (most of them involving phone calls from an elderly lady just when torture is about to happen), a wee bit of misdirection (a completely pointless Arabian man on horseback in this film full of Israelis), and some dark humor (done well, to be fair). All of it is shot and directed masterfully -- again, to be fair -- but it's like the world's most beautiful dress being put on a corpse. Ultimately, in spite of its solid acting and sumptuous visuals, the story is so fallow that it doesn't have the impact or drive that the rest of its talent deserves.",Negative

This movie could have been great if they had more production money. The actors probably took 80 % of the budget. They kind of set the movie up in the first few minutes with a book title about Dark Matter and the disappearance of the Lost Colony then it was like the Energizer Bunny it just kept going and going with no real plot development after that. Was it extraterrestrials controlling dark matter? Was it a supernatural force like vampires or aliens that are sensitive to all forms of light and discovered how to make it dark so they could swoop down and take their prey? Was the dark sentient and literally consumed people to survive? Was this the end or the beginning of the end? Was this just a way for the producer to make a quick buck(it bombed worldwide) without much substance? Was this a waste of 92 minutes? Tune in for the sequel. OK folks you can breathe now there is no sequel planned..at least not yet!!!,Negative
"Well, Rufus Sewell. He is great in anything he touches. This one grows on you like Wallander as you have to adjust to a new environment wth the show based on italian crime stories. And he evens makes reference in the show at one point to his likeness to Joaquin Phoenix, which I thought was great! Helps us to remember the guy he looks soooo much like",Positive
Why did it end? I saw a few episodes and then no more. I was getting into it and there were none to be seen. I hope Amazon will get more. The ladies are intriguing.,Positive
I was left wanting more. Cumberbatch is an incredible actor. I felt he wasn't  appropriately  challenged by this roll. I can't wait to see his next project .,Positive
"Woo I just love you - great body, great face. You deserve it - I hope you win, baby. So hot!",Positive
While the finale of the series could be call ambiguous it also left a decent ending that will still leave many fans of the series happy enough so there should be little disgruntlement felt by them.  This season saw the removal of Sam Carter as leader of Atlantis and the Representative of the IOA placed in charge though he isn't the puppet many expect him to be. Also we see a much stronger showing of some of the background characters which is appreciated especially since this is the final season I guess the writers and producers felt that those characters deserved that.  While we say goodbye to this sci-fi series which started weak but ended strong a sad farewell you can add this series to your other t.v. show dvd collection to watch again at your leisure and for the price very much worth it....,Positive

"A Black woman slices the face of another Black woman.  It takes 30 scars to fix and the victim will have that slash for the rest of her life.  The Marshals go to Upstate NY to solve this one.This has a scene similar to one in the film ""About Schmidt.""  Remember when Jack Nicholson's character remembers his birth home and it's now a tire store?  Well, one officer remembers his early time in Utica.  They show a photo of his uncle who also worked in law enforcement, and he had a deep, juicy, Kirk Douglas-like butt chin.  If you love the saucy, burrough-oriented flavor of this show, you may miss it as the LatinA officers from other seasons aren't here.  Still, if you like those ""Sopranos""-type East Coast accents, you'll hear a lot of it here.On the one hand, this was a blackchick-on-blackchick crime.  How could a sistagurl do that to one of her own!?  However, in the course of this episode, two other Black women try to hide/protect the perpetrator fiercely.  Their loud and belligerent behavior just reinforces sistagurl stereotypes, however.  So there is some unity amongst da sistahs here, but it's used to protect an individual who was in the wrong, sadly.Luckily, the perpetrator gets a heavy punishment.  The episode concludes with the victim learning that her assailant was captured.  I too concur that ""people are people,"" but wearing an Afrocentric and womanist hat, it can be saddening to hear and see the facts presented in this particular show.",Positive
"Malcolm McDowell playing - Malcolm McDowell - as the out-going conductor is being retired to make room for a new hot-shot conductor who, in an excellent scene, tells Malcolm exactly what the problem was with the last piece. The characters are introduced efficiently so we know who they are and what their place will be and the plot is carried forward to an nice ending, leaving us wondering what comes next. A good example of how a script should be written.I have watched all five of the new shows and found Bosch to be the best. This show is right on it's heels.",Positive
"Malcolm and Denise were the only people I rooted for. Malcolm is one of the 10 best players to ever play the game. The winner is deserving and goes to every single tribal council in the game. Lisa was pretty annoying and talked about God all the time. Lisa is a complete hypocrite and backstabs Malcolm twice. It's a joke that Lisa wins player of the year over Malcolm. Malcolm plays a good social game, he's good at challenges, he finds immunity idols. Lisa does none of this and all the religious people watching feel so bad for because she's so worthless and gets awarded player of the year. Abbie is an annoying villain who makes you think that Brazilians are crazy. Russell Swan is a big joke and he tries to be the leader of his tribe. Russell says he's not the leader than becomes a dictator. Michael Skupin is injury prone and shows you why he fell into the fire his first season. Jeff Kent is a complete DBag and tries to screw over people in his alliance. Penner is a great player and falls victim to not forming an alliance at the right time.",Positive
"I missed the original broadcast of this new series, but have since caught up and watched all 3 earlier episodes as well as the current broadcast on TNT.Thrilling scenes using an actual U S Navy Destroyer as it attempts to shield a lab technician as she struggles to develop a vaccine that will help cure and/or prevent a disease which has decimated the world human population.A great series, wonderful action scenes with a great cast",Positive
its amazing to see how they prep for photo shoots... it was entertaining in that sense... but the cruelty of needing to look a certain way... was a bit sad...,Positive
"Season 4 gets involved with the characters' interpersonal relationships more than previous seasons. We also see how using artifacts to do good also can result in very bad outcomes. More people associated with WH13 die, some return from the dead, and some do not. I haven't completed watching the season yet and hope some things get resolved in a better way than so far revealed. I look forward to watching more, but also realize that the more I see, the closer I get to the end.",Positive
"This is the first season of NYPD Blue that you can watch in widescreen HD.  It is phenomenal to see such a fantastic show in wondrous WS/HD.  This season is set just post-9/11, and 9/11 was addressed tangentially but doesn't really drive the stories or anything.  This season brings Danny Sorenson's replacement, John Clark.  So, the kid from Silver Spoons (who I thought was great) is replaced by the kid from Saved by the Bell.  Mark-Paul Gosselaar is excellent and hits the ground running, making a fine addition to the show in the wake of Rick Schroder's departure.  One of his character's first interactions with Sipowicz is to say he thought Sipowicz was acting like a d*ck.  He's holding his own in Sipowicz's world, and the whole show is really firing on all cylinders--even though at this point the only regulars left are perhaps just Sipowicz and Medvoy.  The growing relationship between Sipowicz and McDowell is better fleshed out that I had remembered.  At times, Charlotte Ross's character's pain is quite moving, and you can better see where and why things are headed with the two of them than I realized on my first time through this show (which, admittedly, was over a decade ago, and I was an inconsistent viewer at best at that time just due to being busy).  They just don't make TV this good anymore.  Watch a couple episodes of NYPD in it's NINTH season (when it should, by all accounts, be as stale and paint-by-numbers as it could get) and then watch [insert any cop/detective drama on network television in the past 5 years] and you'll see what I mean.  But do yourself a favor--if you haven't ever watched NYPD Blue, start at the beginning (square, SD picture and all) and work your way through the whole show from the start.  It is a moving, wild ride that will not let you down.  It is amazing that this show is still so good in its ninth season and that there are three seasons after this one to still experience!  Can't beat NYPD Blue!",Positive
"The characters and the stories are all over the places, new characters do not bring anything to the show.Jonas end up stealing a christian relic in the name of Uncle Sam.Does not feel like season 1.Good suspense though.And the season end with a season 5 in mind which never happen.",Negative
"Todd is the ultimate leader.  He could convince people to dig for gold anywhere lol, great show with lots of real drama",Positive
i didnt think i would like this show untill i started watching it i mean who wants to watch a bunch of people duck hunting but other duck hunters but i started watching and it is one of the funniest shows on tv,Positive
"I've found myself enjoying this show and I plan to keep watching. It has some wit and while there may be some expected stories, they are interesting as are the main and supporting characters.  I find myself smiling at their antics and sleazy behavior.  I can see room for growth as the show adds goes on.With this show and Betas part of Amazon's new original streaming show lineup, I find myself wondering if all such shows will have letters of the Greek alphabet in their titles.  It would be kind of a fun thing for them to do.",Positive
"Zoe returns to BlueBell and new characters arrive in the third season. Adding to the complexity of this amusing romantic comedy, hunky George seems to be recovered from his attraction to Zoe but is now hung up on Tanzie while dating a younger (albeit devious beyond her years) cousin of LeVon.  LeVon's relationship with Annabeth continues to grow more permanent looking. Zoe's continuing approach/avoidance of her recently discovered Wilkes family connection is developed with an interesting twist of connection between Zoe's newfound (very attractive) cousin and Wade adding another element of consternation for Zoe as well as her new boyfriend Joel.",Positive
"Fantastic, creative, spellbinding, this has it all. I am looking forward to the second half of this season coming back very soon.",Positive
"This is possibly the best romance story ever told. Many books and movies have wove some element of this story because it is so great. If you have read the book (many pages!) this movie stays very much true to the book. The book tells of the great beauty of Anna, so much so that everyone who sees her, are struck with that beauty. That's a tough act to follow, maybe Elizabeth Taylor could have pulled it off. The actoriss in this story is very talented, and she is beautiful, maybe not Anna Karenina beautiful, but IMHO her talent pulls it off. And sure, if you have never been in nuorotic crazy love, the movie may be lost on you. The filming and sets are well done, actors are excellent. Masterpice Theater always does a ""master"" job. I just finished reading Anna Karenina again (read it many years ago) when I heard there was a new movie released on it. I checked Amazon Prime to see if they had at least one of the old versions of ""Anna"", and found this. ""Anna"" has done many times, and I think I like this as one of the best as it stays true to the book. Incidently the author of the book the movie was based on, really has some other legendary ""have to read in your lifetime"" books, and many consider ""Anna"" his best and closest to his real life.",Positive
"The writing, acting and photography on this show continue to entertain. I love the characters and though the storyline sometimes tends to the more violent than I am comfortable with, the interplay of the personalities keeps me coming back!",Positive
Waht can you say about Mythbusters.aways great!. even teh reruns are fun!My son & I will watch again & again,Positive
"I don't like sports.  I like shows centered around sports even less.  I gave this 5 stars because the cast and the writing has me hooked with the pilot.  Great dialogue, situation (underdog, everyone loves that theme) and actor chemistry.  Definitely hope this one is a keeper for Amazon as I'll be following it.",Positive
"Watched this movie within the last week, then amazon sent a e-quest for a review. to be truthful, I had to watch the trailer to refresh my memory of the movie! Story of a women who eventually disappears after marrying a mob boss's  son. Like the header states, not bad for a time killer.",Negative
Very interesting angle on the aliens take over the world and how we get through.  I enjoyed the pilot and will check out more,Positive
Love seeing the secret lives of people who may be stereotyped as mild-mannered. Definitely portrays classical musicians as rock stars.,Positive
"Love it, love ,it. A no nonesence drama that will have you angry one second and laughing another. Reminds me of some of my friends.",Positive
"J.J. Abrams has done the impossible by making a Star Trek film for everyone. It will appeal to long time fans (most anyways) and the unintiated alike. What really surprised me is how this is more of a character driven film than one relying just on action and SFX. The casting is outstanding, especially Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock. Pine manages to get the essence of Kirk, but not being a parody of William Shatner. He is cocky, yet you know there is intelligence that goes along with his recklessness. Before watching this movie I couldn't think of anyone who combines the looks and smarts to play Spock other than Leonard Nimoy, but Quinto manages to pull it off brilliantly. Karl Urban made a very good Dr. McCoy early on, but they seemed to forget about his character as the movie progressed. The rest of the cast is good, but they are not given that much to do. I just heard on the news that most have signed on for two more movies, so perhaps they will all get their due in future installments. Eric Bana was the weak link here for me. He just wasn't a very intimidating villain. Maybe it was more of the character than his actual acting, but he is not even close to the legend that is Khan. Leonard Nimoy's role was pivotal and not just some cheap cameo, so that was nice.The story, while not mind blowing, is clever enough. For a time travel plot, it is rather easy to follow and I like how they made it an alternate reality to cover up any inconsistencies with the past series.The music (loved how they used the old theme music over the end credits) and SFX are very good as expected. There is also quite a bit of humor that works most of the time. My theater was pretty much full and everyone seemed to be having a good time during and after the movie ended. Star Trek is a well made summer blockbuster that has wide appeal and will likely spawn at least two sequels. So beam up to your local theater and prepare to boldy go where no man has gone before.4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",Positive
"This is a fantastic series. I missed the latest episode and had to watch it on Amazon. I'm so glad I have Amazon Prime, which enables me to watch my series without commercials.",Positive
I live in DC...some of this is funny and all to real. Other  stuff...well not so much as it seems scripted  and Troudeau  knows better.,Negative
"i didnt think this movie was as bad as some as the reviews.........i thought it was a solid nice sci fi movie......the idea was eerie & maybe it was some  kind of a re boot of society idea type of movie......i did find it odd the animals were able to survive the dark shadows....hmmm maybe cuz the animals are pure & didnt need re-booting & unlike humans who have been so jaded & corrupted etc they needed a fresh start.............maybe thats why the ending was the way it was.........the people left were the ""purest"" choice.......my only complaint was it was so dark for most of the watch but i still enjoyed it................",Negative
I watched season 1 and wanted more.  Season 4 was already beginning on tv so I purchased season 2 & 3 so I could catch up.,Positive
"It seemed a bit like tuning in later in the season, but I'm excited to see what is going to go on next.",Positive
"Before JJ Abrams, there was Chris Carter. The X Files, Millennium, and now The After...Carter is still brilliant and a master of quietly creeping up on this viewer and scaring the crap out of her. The final scene of the pilot left me anxious to know what comes next. Hope Amazon selects The After as one of its original shows. It could be a winner.",Positive
The 3rd season of Rookie Blue was a great season. Each subsequent season is better than the last really love this series.,Positive
"Interesting in the first few episodes but then deteriorates into the mean, nasty British officer and his effect on the little town the main character lives in.  How about more of the &#34;rally cries&#34; and the debate going on during this time between neighbors, some who we call patriots and some we call Torys today?  The episode could be taken out of a town in Nazi Europe somewhere where the villagers are trying to survive the Local mean and nasty Nazi Lord.",Negative
The movie had a great cast and many independent movies do but this was kind of hard to follow.  You just kept wait for the plot to take you somewhere and it really never came.  I gave three stars because of the cast but the plot I would give one.,Negative
I love this series and my whole family and I enjoy viewing it together! It is really good and I highly recommend it!,Positive
"The quality of the writing and production in the science fiction genre has taken a quantum step up with SyFy developing new shows that provide content to satisfy the genre for which they are named and Continuum is one of them.  The show got me hooked quickly and left me wanting more remarkably fast as they built from a small cast of characters I was vested in and successfully adding to them as the show built.  The flashbacks are used consistently to give us insights into why Kiera is important by revealing a past in which she clearly fought on one side but had experiences in which she clearly questions the actions and motives of the powers that be in her time.  That coupled with the complexity of who Alec really is in the future and what sort of affect she can have on him as the old version of him obviously sees himself as someone who has made some dark choices in his life that he regrets and wishes he had done things differently driving him to mastermind the sending back of the &#34;terrorists&#34; as well as Kiera in the first place.  The show has a great backdrop for both episode based storylines and the bigger storyline of Kiera wanting to get back to her son and husband.  But seeing the past is adding a perspective that when combined with the experiences the flashbacks reveal open up a great deal of possibilities for how all of this is changing her perspective and not believing that things in her time are all working well and fair to the entire population as apposed to just the elite and the middle class that support them causing interesting analogies to the present with all the power in the hands of large corporations and the government being more and more puppets in their hands as the corporations are international controlling the money that drives who it is that makes up the governments and what their agenda's are.  Not to get off on a tangent about those analogies, just a good way of writing the storyline such that it gets the audience more vested in the grey area of changes that are positive and changes that are destructive and the challenges that grey area presents our characters in this story.  But that is definitely part of what makes Continuum a great show with great potential as the story flows through those situations where what events are good, bad, and most interesting those that aren't clear.  Especially given that the man with the most power in the future clearly states in one of the flashbacks that their society appears to be one of freedom but that its people have never been less free in history.  Given we are getting small glimpses into that future and all of it's implications makes for each one of those little revelations all the more important and feed into the potential for making what is happening less black and white than when only having to deal with the futures present time as Kiera faces the events of each episode.  Like finding out at the end of season 2 and beginning of season 3 that for Kiera to die in the past destroys the future timeline making her a critical character just as her influence on a young Alec Sandler is but was obvious from the first season when it was fairly quickly revealed who he and Jason are.  I think the writing is great and production of good quality making this a great new addition to the Science Fiction landscape available on TV.  My hope for it's future is that SyFy backes it to a complete story and doesn't simply cut funding after a season and leave us hanging as so many shows have.  It isn't like the old Star Trek that didn't require closure as it was strictly episode based, as is the whole franchise of shows and movies.  Continuum tells us a story that needs to lead through a continuous series of potential landmines from the future Liber8 characters actions and Kiera's decisions on how to effect change to what they are doing and influence the young Alec does.  Of course they could end it quickly by have her strike a decisive victory wiping out the future Liber8 characters and returning to her own timeline but their presence is already affecting change in Season 3 that appears to be of a level of magnitude that the future is affected to a degree already.  I'm excited to be along for the ride and hope they decide to produce a long quality storyline before they take us to that end!!!",Positive
The CDs arrived timely and in good condition. NCIS just keeps getting better.  I do not fin d the interaction of Jethro and the FBI agent based on a mutual ex-wife of much interest.,Positive

"The main reason I rented this was because of Lauren Graham. I have been a fan since following her through all the seasons of The Gilmore Girls, a show that is close to my heart, mainly due to Graham's brilliant performance. Sadly, her movie roles thus far have been rather lackluster, partly because of the secondary roles she has been playing, as in ""Evan Almighty"" and ""Flash of Genius"". In ""Answer Man"", Graham gets to shine a bit more, but I still felt her character deserved more exposure.""Answer Man"" reminds me of ""As Good As It Gets"", only it never quite gets a chance to achieve the brilliance of the latter. Like Jack Nicholson's OCD character, Jeff Daniels plays a quirky and eccentric character. He portrays Arlen Faber, an author whose one book ""Me and God"" created a sensation and became a bestseller, cornering 10% of the ""God"" market. Yet 20 years later, Arlen feels he has not really learned anything nor gained any great insights, so he shuts himself away in his Philadelphia house downtown, living a reclusive life, shunning all his fan mail & interviews, much to the chagrin of his literary agent. Feeling frustrated with all the self-help books that fail to lift his spirits nor grant him any useful perspectives on life, Arlen carts the books away to a used bookstore run by a recovering young alcoholic Kris (Lou Taylor Pucci in a wonderfully nuanced performance), only to be refused (as Kris doesn't have any money to buy Arlen's books). To cut a long story short - Arlen hurts his back and seeks help at a chiropractor's which is owned and operated by single mom Elizabeth (Lauren Graham). The pair start to bond but the relationship is complicated by Arlen's eccentricities and inability to reach out to people who need him and Liz's own personal problems.Meanwhile Kris the recovering alcoholic begins to show up at Arlen's home seeking advice in return for taking some of Arlen's books off his hands.The various story arcs do intersect quite well, but the characters lack sufficient development - so Arlen is seeking answers...but why exactly has he allowed 20 years to pass by, and his whole romance with Graham almost seems contrived at times. Graham's personal problems are alluded to but never fully explored, and her interactions with her seven-year-old son seem unbearably awkward and even a tad fake at times. Pucci's character was the most likable in this movie, in that he elicits the viewer's sympathy and makes one want to root for him in his battle against the bottle, yet even his role seems to lack true depth.""Answer Man"" is interesting and engaged my attention, but it is also quite forgettable. I would certainly recommend it as a rental especially for those who like Lauren Graham, Jeff Daniels, and Lou Taylor Pucci, but it doesn't compare to some real gems like ""As Good As It Gets"".",Negative
"Mental illness is one of the last taboos in our society.  This show tackles the subject straight on, gets us to see the world from the patient's point of view without asking for sympathy, just understanding.  It's an amazing show.  The plot lines are the average police procedural with a twist, however, the character development is thoughtful and very well done.  I was delighted to see Season 2 and hope this show remains a long time.",Positive
i have loved this show from the first time i watched it. others will love the cool courtroom diva Brooke Elliott is a diva in this awesome show. but if you are going to watch this show and have not seen the other four seasons watch them first then watch this season.,Positive
Justified does it again; my wife and I have been binge watching Justified and enjoyed Season 3 more than any other; the new villain Mr. Quarles and Limehouse were good additions to the staff,Positive
"3 year old boy, 7 year old girl watched it and they liked it and talked back to the TV. I am sure if it was available they would watch it often. I do wish new cartoons had a more diverse cast however, as in different ethnic groups represented equally and/or as a lead character.....something Amazon should consider!",Negative
"In all the sherlock holmes, watson was the smart one, but hidden in the background.  However, I like the new twist on how they play out their character roles.  Adds that much more to it just like the Sherlock Holmes played by Robert Downey Jr.",Positive
"I tried the book series but couldn't get into it-both before the tv Bones began and after watching it-they are so different. The series is a wonderful mix of science, friendship,  sexual tension between the two leads and ""who did it""- the murder that is, that I am getting each season til I have them all. Watch the show on FOX and get hooked as I did.",Positive
"*My husband and I had just caught up with all the past shows on White Collar and were twiddling our thumbs wondering what we could watch together. Nothing violent or gorey (my preference) and nothing too cutesy or overly romantic (his preference). This fits the bill!I I was 'iffy' with the pilot but liked the main character well enough to give it a second chance. I am glad I did. My husband and I both enjoy this show-it's funny, interesting and the characters are very engaging! Very little blood or gore-great for me since I am squeamish and don't typically watch 'doctor shows' becuase they are too graphic. This is just well-written and fun to watch! So far, nothing offense. How nice is that??",Positive
I love this show. It has great acting and a very good plot line each week. I want to see it continue for a long time.,Positive
I enjoy Piper Perabo. But Auggie disappears in too many of the shows. But it is getting better this season.,Negative
"Of the prime premiers I've seen so far, I've liked this the best. I was in orchestras growing up so the connection is obvious. That said, there is nothing better than seeing mad genius at work!",Positive
"I really enjoyed this pilot.  The acting and writing is very good.  I like the cast.  The only thing that I didn't like is that there is way too much sex that really doesn't enhance the plot line or character development.  I don't think that I am a prude, but I do get a little bored with so many scenes with juvenile, gratuitous sex.  That being said, I think that there is a lot of good material here that could make an interesting new series.",Positive
"I find all of their programs very interesting.  At just 22 minutes per segment, they're great to watch at breakfast or any time you want just a short diversion.  The programs are always enlightening.",Positive
"This show is fantastic, if you have liked any season there is no reason that you wont like this one.Recent seasons have seemed to get a bit hokier - Texas was definitely off the rails. With that said though this is still one of the best reality shows available.Season 10 advertises that it has gone back to basics and this season seems to show it. This season seems to have less drama and has one of the more likable casts in a recent memory.",Positive
I think this series has gone on too long.  Not very interesting anymore.,Negative
This is such a fun show! I thought when it first came on it was going to be a typical high school drama and yes they are in high school and yes there is alot of drama &#34;Awesome Drama&#34;. This seris is really good and it drives me crazy waiting a week for the next episode to come on,Positive
It was a great sci fi adventure which keeps your interest throughout. It was well worth the time of watching.,Positive
"I've tried several Amazon series, and each one has too much swearing.  Right off the bat, this one has swearing.. literally in the first sentence!  That is such a turn off!  Every sentence after that is much the same.  I finally couldn't take it anymore.  I'm completely done with Amazon series.  Disappointed.",Negative
"Having watched every episode of Burn Notice, my wife and I, along with several friends and family members, are completely hooked.In a way this show reminds me of another series we thoroughly enjoyed 20 years ago, Stingray. Although Stingray was completely under the radar, and Michael is always blip number one, there are still similarities. Michael's skill at going undercover and improvising a role comes to mind. Also, Stingray's stories were a trade in 'favors', and Michael and friends often help someone as a favor, or for only expenses. Both had secretive but evidently quite successful histories in secret ops.One of the things I enjoy most about Burn Notice are the little 'spy tips' that grace every show. Some of them make sense, some are utter nonsense, and some of them I'm not too sure about, but they're all fun.Another thing I like about it is the way in which the 'bad guys' often come to grief in very satisfying, often funny ways. The late 2nd season episode where Michael foils a bank robbery is hilarious.Whether it makes sense all the time or not, obviously the writers of this show care, and are putting a good effort into each script. That makes up for any sins and makes for a quite entertaining show.Season One obviously contains the ""origin story"" in the pilot, which is a big advantage. However, this series is remarkably consistent throughout its run, and all the episodes are of very consistent quality as well. Although there have been a few stand out shows that I particularly enjoyed, I can't really think of any ""stinkers"" that I had to overlook. USA Network just keeps coming out with many of the most entertaining shows on TV over the last few years, and Burn Notice is part of that group.",Positive
Hope it has a long future.AlAll players are awsume.Were has James Spader been hiding?Looking forward to the next season.,Positive
"""I spent exactly 17 days in the pornography industry and somehow these 17 days are supposed to define who I am for the rest of my life, but I hope that people can see me for who I really am."" Linda Boreman (Seyfried) is a normal teenager in the sixties. She is a little naive and sheltered but nothing too extreme. When she meets a man named Chuck Traynor (Saragaard) he promises to take care of her and give her what she wants. Happy to be out of her parents house she gets married and things are looking up. When Chuck gets her a job she thinks its going to be fantastic. Little by little her life is taken away from her, then one day she fights back. This is first and foremost NOT a movie about pornography. This is a movie about a woman who becomes manipulated and controlled by a man she trusted and her fight to get someone to help her. While Seyfried does a good job in this it's nothing Oscar worthy but she does play it in a way that makes the movie very depressing and you really feel for her and want her to make it out. I could keep going on about this and many people won't watch just because they think it's something it isn't, but this is worth watching and a real women's lib type movie. Overall, if you liked Boogie Nights you will like this. I give it a B.",Positive
"This is a thrilling, thought provoking series that rarely lets you breathe.  From the first minute to the closing credits it keeps your heart racing with excitement.  Terrific acting by all concerned, excellent plot line and amazing FX.  Watch it.",Positive

I thought I would try this one out and got in on about the 5th episode on TV.  It was so good I couldn't wait to see all the first episodes so I found them on Amazon and was very satisfied.,Positive
"This show is too funny! I know I shouldn't like this show, but I do. The stories are great and the actors are hilarious.",Positive
"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Eighth Year is another entertaining season of my fave show. Some of the standout episodes include: Choreographed, Burned, Haystack, Florida, and Annihilated. Christoper Meloni and Mariska Hargitay are talented actors and so is Ice-T. I highly recommend this top-notch show, enjoy!",Positive
"Being a police procedural freak, I found this series like nothing I had ever seen on the screen.  The starkness of the countryside painted a back drop for the characters living and working there.  While crime and murder come into play, I found the character development to be what actually made for a 5-star review.",Positive
"Fantastic vocals, intriguing drama, hubba hubba romance, who could ask for more?  Okay, some parts of the story lines needed help in season one but those issues were totally forgivable and easily eclipsed by the shows drama, development and music.  Take the the time and enjoy this guilty pleasure.  I sure did.",Positive
Better than the first.  Know a bit more about the history of the characters and their motivations.  Dr. Seroyan is excellent addition.  You get a hint of grossness of the murder victims but not over much. The writing is still excellent and holds your attention. Looking forward to the new season and more cases.,Positive
"Excellent plots, Excellent acting, especially by Michael Kitchen, excellent take-away insights, excellent settings, excellent dialogue.  What is not to thoroughly appreciate about such a series?",Positive
"They have done pretty good following the book, but just enough lee way to be a good mini series or show.  I love Stephan King stories.  This is a great one!",Positive
Excellent recap of the development of weapons and applications and howmany modern products were affected by use during warfare.,Positive
"Pilot was a slow to get going, but finished well.  If you like family dynamic drama's, then this is for you.",Negative
It's relatively educational and its one of my kid's favorite shows.  He's watch all of them once and he's going back through them from the beginning.,Positive
We love this show. Nice short episodes (10 Min). So little ones can sit thru the whole show. Nice learning plot line.,Positive
This second season has a lot of holes in it but still enjoyable to watch. By holes I mean missing characters whose absence could be covered by a few lines of dialogue. I look forward to season 3 if there is one and I hope there is.,Negative
Another show about how hard is to be white upper middle class in America. Is it about millennials? about old hippies? bisexuals? Not sure I can tell.,Negative
Racial stereotypes;  Barbie doll athletic widow.  This could be the makings of a standard Hollywood high concept meme.  With work and some honest scriptwriting this has some promise.  Makes me wish Hollywood could try a little BBC casting where actors look like real people and not photoshopped dolls.  I would watch more if the plot progresses but I'm concerned about where this will go and grow.,Negative
Took a everyday life situation & was able to make fun of it in a fun way.  A great young adult movie.,Positive
"""You're just impatient! Ti West is a master at creating atmosphere! If you didn't like this movie, I'm sure Joel Schumacher will make a loud, angry horror movie one of these days! This is for TRUE fans of horror!""These are just a few of the retorts you hear from fans when you complain about West's slow-burn spookiness. I will grant, as others have done, that West does excellent work with a camera -- he frames and tracks some really sumptuous shots -- but atmosphere is no substitute for a story. I don't watch movies for atmosphere. That's why I buy lounge music, or candles, or fake cobwebs in October. If atmosphere is all a movie has going for it, then it's no better than one of those looped images of flickering fireplaces you can pop on the TV during Christmas.So what about the story? Isn't it scary? Nope. Two twenty-somethings -- Claire and Luke -- are the only staff members at the soon-to-close Yankee Pedlar Inn. With cheeky self-consciousness, they spend their many hours of free time searching the old hotel for one of the ghosts that is said to reside there. It's a fairly standard ghost story trope, and the addition of a psychic who has ""reverse deja vu"" does little to twist the story into something intriguing or new. There is, essentially, no story, which was a similar flaw in the nearly identical West film, The House of the Devil (girl left alone for a long time, strange goings-on, some people are not who they claim to be, incredibly slow atmospheric build to a cheap-show ten minute conclusion of sloppily written ""chills"").So the story sucks. Movies can still succeed by virtue of the characters alone, even if the plot is confusing or sloppy. Unfortunately, Luke and Claire, while well-acted and realistic enough, are not interesting characters. They speak with the kind of canned dialogue that screenwriters pen when they aren't sure what's supposed to happen next in the film. Sara Paxton tries desperately to make Claire appear as cute as she can in every scene; she looks like she took acting lessons from a newborn puppy. On the very, very few moments when the movie lets the viewers glimpse something creepy, the effect is numbed by Claire's mopey mugging.I'm certain it's meant to be funny, as it is often accompanied by hokey sitcom music. West seems to be as confused by comedy as he is by horror, though. The movie thinks things are funny -- a girl in her underwear runs by a small boy! it takes Claire five minutes to take out the trash! the coffee girl is socially awkward! -- but even if they were, they contribute nothing to the story or the characters. All in all, it's like watching two boring people making a movie about themselves being boring. Dull characters who are authentically acted are still dull.West obviously has an eye for making movies but not for telling stories. He tries too hard to be subtle and artistic. An excellent example is the final shot of the film. My friends did not understand why the camera held for so long on the final shot, but I saw what all of them missed. I won't tell you what it is, but I will say this: if you don't know it's there, it's almost impossible to see it. I only noticed the subtle little parting shot that West included in the scene because I read a review, like this one, telling me to look for it. And that's the thing: if your artistry is so subtle, so careful, so minute as to escape the notice of nearly every single viewer of your film, then maybe you're focused too much on the background stuff (like West's highly touted skill at creating atmosphere) and not enough on the actual meat of your movie (characters, story, conflict).Dialogue that treads water. Dull and annoying characters. Almost no story to speak of. Cliched plot. More than your average number of fake scares (I counted three before the first fifteen minutes). Unsatisfying climax and conclusion.",Negative
"Journeyman is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the BEST television shows ever produced. The concept of Journeyman is brilliant, the marketing was abysmal, the ratings were satisfactory for a freshman show, the over-all quality of Journeyman is superb. But don't think Journeyman is just a show about time travel. It's so much more. Journeyman is a show about a heroes. Dan Vasser is the hero who goes back in time to help right wrongs. Livia is his hero partner who helps him. Katie Vasser is his hero wife who, through no fault of her own, finds herself married to a time-traveling man who, coincidently is time traveling with his ex-girlfriend. This show could have taken so many low roads with this issue. But never once did it slip into the little nasty things other shows use to pull people in - illicit sex, bad language, drug addiction. Journeyman was one of the few shows in many years that showed humanity at its best. We need MORE shows like this, not less. Why NBC canceled Journeyman is a mystery to many, many fans who continue to proliferate all over the internet, months after this show was canceled. I say to NBC: remember Star Trek? Now, FOX owns the rights to this show. We can hope that Fox does a better job and has more respect for this diamond of a show that got coal treatment. For the fans of Journeyman, WE were the ones who lost. But NBC? They deserve to be in fourth place amongst the networks. They are the real losers here. Thank YOU FOX and UNBOX for offering us the sale of the thirteen episodes of this fine show. Now...as for the DVD...?",Positive
I loved it! I will admit that I am a reality TV junky and  lately my reality TV shows have lacked luster. And then I discovered Dance Moms and these ladies  have a whole new set of drama! Whoa!,Positive
So far this show is very faithful to the book while maintaining a very fast pace.  Well worth a watch and of course a read.,Positive
"I'm a middle-aged woman and I can't say I actually enjoyed this show.  However, my husband and son really loved it.  It was interesting to see how they choose to live while being rich however.  The footage filmed in their kitchen almost made me sick to my stomach.  Not for the faint of heart.",Negative
"Dexter has finally made his Blu-Ray debut, and the glossy, well-made series looks wonderful in the format.  Besides some relatively small BD-Live features (including seeing the first episode the third season), there really isn't anything here that wasn't on the standard-def version of the Complete First Season, but for Blu-Ray owners who haven't taken the plunge into Dexter's world, this is definitely worth checking out.  Below is my original review for first season.The interesting concept of this Showtime series makes it reason enough to check it out.  Michael C. Hall (Six Feet Under) plays the title character, who works in forensics for the Florida police by day, and is a serial killer at night. Because of his job and upbringing by a police officer foster father (James Remar), Dexter knows how to cover his tracks while wearing his mask of humanity by day.  Slowly though, things start to take a turn when another serial killer with connections to Dexter's own mysterious past rears his head, and soon enough our title character is caught in a bloody game of cat and mouse.  What makes Dexter so good is the approach taken to the theme of the series by the creators and Hall himself.  What could have easily flopped and failed miserably instead evolves episode by episode as we attempt to see what makes Dexter tick.  The rest of the cast is excellent as well to say the least. Julie Benz (the vampiric Darla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel) is superb as Rita: Dexter's rape victim girlfriend whom he keeps around so he doesn't have to bother with sex, HBO's Oz veterans Lauren Velez and David Zayas as fellow cops, and hottie Jennifer Carpenter (whom Hall has recently married, seriously) as Dexter's sister.  Not since Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer has there been an interesting and above all chilling glimpse into the mind of a madman that walks among us.  Spectacular, and definitely worth picking up even if you never caught the show on Showtime during it's first season run.",Positive
"I had gotten season 1 & debated about getting any other seasons. The show was very well done but the character of Bones was very irritating as she was clueless to everyday life, & only spoke & related to things in scientific terms. (I realize this was the ""joke"" of the show but it was really annoying to me.)  Friends told me that it got better as the seasons progressed.I got season 3 BEFORE getting season 2, as I didn't think it would make much of a difference (& it was cheaper at the time too). My friends were right, Bones isn't anywhere near as annoying as she was in season 1, she's more normal.  The only thing with jumping from season 1 to season 3, apparently I missed a LOT in season 2. There are (now) new characters (Booth apparently has a history with one of them) & there are many new story lines. Season 3, I find out Bones' father (played by Ryan O'Neal) was arrested in season 2 by Booth. There are other story lines I need to get caught up on as well from season 2.The show is very well done, although the corpses are rather gross & disgusting - and sometimes they are way too graphic. There are several extras on this DVD & there ARE subtitles for the hearing impaired.  Also, this DVD set has a ""bonus"" of the first 4 episodes from season 4.  I have ordered season 2 (so I can see what I missed). Season 3 is MUCH BETTER than season 1.",Positive
"I love this show!  I love how these four men are ridiculously stupid and unaware.  Honestly, I laugh throughout the entire show.  All four of these actors are REALLY good!!  I just posted something on my Facebook (FB) about it.  I do not think Amazon has done a good job at getting the word out on this show as I just happen to stumble across it one night.  I wish Amazon had a FB connection so one could post a show that is good to their FB friends, but I have not figured out how to do this via Amazon.",Positive
"My kids (4,2,and 1) LOVE this show! And I love all the actors from my favorite shows as the voices (Kevin, Sguiggy, etc). Bring forth more seasons!",Positive
"Good sci-fi, ready to find out what happens next. Least interested in the drama between the car salesmen and the police guy, really liked the police guy charachter/actor. Sad he seemed to be put out by the end of the first ep. MORE please!",Positive
"I love a good mystery/thriller/action movie or TV show but American Horror Story is a bit too gory and visually graphic for me. I watched most of Season One but could not finish that season. Thought I'd try again, but had to turn off the video less than half way through. Perhaps if they left more to the imagination and less blood and guts??? but then it may not appeal to you. We all have our preferences, this one is not mine.",Negative
One of the reasons I think this series does so well is that you never know which characters will live and which will die--even some of the most endearing and important people may not survive--and they face new problems in a believable situation each season that lends to even greater enjoyment.,Positive
"The original Star Trek series took time to establish itself as the premiere franchise it is today. The movies steadily improved the characters and special effects, building on a large canon of established Trek lore.  The best movies gleefully embraced this rich history; the failures ignored or contradicted it. Star Trek is simply too big to reinvent, and J.J. Abrams knows it.  So he did the next best thing by tweaking the established universe of Star Trek just enough to carve out his own little patch for the movie.This is the beginning of Star Trek re-imagined as a futuristic Earth that incorporates the go-go 60s with iPod style.  We see Kirk as a kid on the farm, Spock struggling with his half-Vulcan nature and Bones becoming a crotchety windbag--which, it becomes quickly apparent, he always was. We witness Kirk's solution to the Kobiyashi Maru, Spock's acceptance to Starfleet, and the construction of the Enterprise.  In short, this is a true and proper launch of a Star Trek movie, from the beginning, so that all those non-Trekkies won't feel like they missed out...But if you are a non-Trekkie, you missed out.  There are so many nods to Trek lore that my head nearly exploded. SPOILER RED ALERT.Sulu fences! There's a splash of light over the captain's eyes when he sits on the bridge, just like the original series. Red shirts die! The same sounds beep and bleep in the background, from the sensors to the transporters. There are several Wrath of Khan references, from Spock's famous last words to creepy worms that take control of your brain. There's even old-style Romulans and Klingons.  Fans worried that Abrams was going to remake the series in such a way as to make it unrecognizable can rest easy; this is the Star Trek we know and love, dusted off and buffed to a 21st century shine.The plot involves time travel, a guest cameo, and references to the central conceit of the series: Spock follows the rules, Bones doesn't, and Kirk floats above it all, waffling between the two ideologies and blazing his own path as his ego suits him. The movie has no qualms about portraying Kirk as a womanizing jerk or using him as the butt of some hilarious slapstick. It also isn't afraid to push the envelope with the aliens, going beyond makeup to ensure they're just unnerving enough for you to notice them even if the rest of the crew doesn't. This is more than just a new Star Trek, it's Star Trek done right with a bigger budget.There are some flaws.  The villain is one dimensional. Uhura's headstrong personality has to carry the burden of embodying all females in Trek, which begins to grate. Winona Ryder (age 38) seems to have wandered onto the set to play Spock's (Zachary Quinto, age 32) mother. And an uncharacteristically vengeful tactics from the good guys at the end of the movie borders on ""ludicrous speed.""But you know what? I forgive all that.  This movie made Trek worth watching all over again and reminded us why it's okay to travel through time and space, encounter green alien hotties, and bed them.  Because it's FUN.",Positive
It was getting a little of the same ol.. same ol...  And then there's more.Season 4 is the best so far and episode 10 was a real shocker.Love this show and it's hard to wait for the next episode 10/18,Positive
"This show has always had a nice premise.But, the constant attempts to be witty, funny and dramatic regularly (constantly?) get in the way of good television and keep the show from being really interesting.",Negative
"Storage Wars is an awesome TV show. It's a very fast pace show and it gets right down with the premise in every show. It works!In every show does the same thing will happen. You see all the same characters going around looking in storage units and bidding on the units if they like them. Then, after auction, you find out what they bought exactly in the units. Sometimes they getting their money back, sometimes they losing money, or sometimes they make a profit. That's it! You going to see this exact same thing in every show. But it's so good because everyone loves watching to seeing what they bought in each unit. Then, finding out if they were right or not before buying the unit.I think this shows makes more and more people come out and try to do what these people do in the show. They try to go out and bid on the units themselves, but we usually won't see other people bid and win a storage from the stars of this show. It does happen but we don't usually see that. I believe I only saw that happen once for all 19 episodes.I'm looking forward to watching Season 2 next.",Positive
"Twists and Turns Galore, got me hooked and I watched all three seasons in two weeks. Love it.....and can not wait for new season...........",Positive
"Best show on TV, great special effects, lots of action, I love it. Great acting, I can't wait to see season 4.",Positive
"As much a I love Mark Strong, this series is just not one I could connect to.  I tried.  Several episodes under the belt and the only thought that came to mind was, &#34;Good chance I could find something better to spend money on...&#34;  Degenerate cops going after degenerates is not new territory in TV, but I just wanted to see them all go away.  A better title might have been, &#34;No Winter Sun&#34;.  I gave it a '2' for a couple of good actors who chose a bad project, IMO.",Negative
Although I would call myself a sci-fi buff I truly enjoy a show that challenges our mindset.  Years ago (probably 58 yrs.) a comic strip had a detective-Dick Tracy- with a wrist watch that was also a camera and a communication device.  I have lived long enough to see something similar to it come to life.  Long before the first spaceship went into orbit Flash Gordon another comic hero was circling the distant planets in a spaceship.  Sci-Fi for many is boring for me I enjoy seeing the imagination of men/women become reality.,Positive
So far a bit lack luster the plot is very slow.  But it is my sort of show .you know all metaphysical and hyperdimensional and stuff. So we will continue to tune in and buy when we have to .,Negative
"after selecting the season pass, I now know that Amazon just messed with me.  There's no point in getting a season pass unless the 10 cents per episode really means that much to you. If you DO NOT get the season pass, then you can see the episodes you want the day after they air; if not, then you need to wait 2 days (or deep into the night, since it's now more than 25 hours after airing and I still don't have access to Red Menace on Amazon) to see a given show.  The season pass thing sucks big time.  It's fine for saving you a buck, but not worth the grief of having to wait and wait and wait for the next episode in a series.  They're just jerks.  Ignore Amazon. Buy it or just get cable and use xFinity on demand to see it when you want to =&#62; literally a day after (not 24 hours).  You have to put up with commercials, but it's better than not having access at all.",Negative
"I just am in love with John Goodman these days! SO far he seems to just keep picking winners for his work!The idea of these men sharing ( does happen) apartment in Washington with all their different ways of life is mostamusing. Plus entire politically side is very amusing and sure it happens in this exact crazy way with some of the representatives.I strongly recommend this for both men and women to watch, if you enjoy enjoyable writing and excellent acting.",Positive
The Norwegian legend of trolls is cleverly uncovered in this modern mock documentary. The special effects that create the trolls are very well done. The monsters are otherworldly and bizarre. A ton of fun to watch.,Positive
"The main female protagonist/antagonist- Anna- is played by the young actress who was in American Horror Story seasons 1 and 3..I  think her first name is Taisha. I'm too lazy to go look She does an excellent job. So does the memory detective. The synopsis is misleading. He doesn't 'manipulate' memory but tries to guide people through their memories to help solve crimes. He's recovering from a recent trauma and so is vulnerable. The 2 carry the movie on their backs as their chemistry is what makes it work. The visuals are full of lush, rich, saturated color. Most of the film is a puzzle. The POV is unreliable narrator. However, despite the unusual context its situated in, its pretty traditional. Didn't really break new ground, but nonetheless, its a well done entertaining film.",Positive
"Edge of seat production. Solid story line, lots of action. Characters are well deveoped and followed in each of the episodes.",Positive
"This season is enjoyable, but there is something missing. I am not sure if its the banter between Castle and Becket or that it feels like the other characters are forced.",Positive
"It is always full of twists and turns and it is all about the characters, they are all so great on the screen together, a very real feel.  I really look forward to watching all the time.  I hope this show stays on for many more seasons to come.  I am so glad Annie gets a gun once in a while now, LOL.  Geez.  That needs to be a must for this girl with all the stuff she gets herself into.  Just an all around good show, very enjoyable to watch.  I still love Annie and Auggie together, they have this incredible chemistry in this show...  the best.",Positive
"the original tv series was set on the bridge over the sea between sweden and denmark.  there were two detectives working the case, one from each country. this is keeping true to that but placing the action in texas and mexico.  the woman detective in both versions has asperger's and there are many absurdist moments where her lack of people skills almost do in her investigation.  she has not one ounce of tact.the script for this opening segment follows the scandinavian one scene by scene.  there is no deviation. there is a corpse severed in half found on the bridge, one half in one country.  the other half in the other. it is two people as well, half of each. this involves both countries' police forces in the case. one of the halves belongs to a conservative and controversial judge in Texas.  the other half is a young Mexican woman.  following hard on the heels of this is a heart stopping bomb attack on a journalist by apparently the same perpetrator.it is too early to tell if this will live up to the award winning swede-Dane version, which was also a popular hit in Europe.  but it is a promising start.for sheer beauty, by the way, nothing compares to the bridge which goes between sweden and denmark over the sea.  it is absolutely gorgeous.",Positive
"The movie was very well produced and directed.  It was taken from true events.  The movie held my interest from beginning to end. There were moments in the movie that I found disturbing and very thought provoking, however, as a whole, I really enjoyed this movie tremendously.  Tatum O'Neil gave an outstanding performance.  I do recommend this movie and gave it a 5 star rating.",Positive
The show is great.  I would like to see it more often.  Seems like they go weeks in between sometimes on the air dates.,Positive
"Run to the bank, LizLemon! 30Rock busts out for season two sharper than ever! Spot on with it's cameos, Seinfeld-esque moments and knockout characters and writing, it deserves every one of its accolades. Bottle of wine and and one ""Play All"" menu selection, I found myself laughing out loud more than once with each episode.Don't miss the special features of the ""live on stage"" episode, raising money for the PAs during the infamous strike. It's spontaneous and fun to hear the audience laugh along. Bravo! If I had the patience to watch network TV, this would be on my list (but I don't)!",Positive
"I would have given it 5 stars for the information and the show, but the sound quality was lacking. Worth watching.",Positive
The Seasons are extremely short at 4 episodes. The stories were masterfully complex must came around at the end with attention to the little details.,Positive
"I'm going to have trouble finding twenty words on this one.  I just plain didn't like it.  Other people seem to have liked it a lot, but I didn't.  I'm no critic; but that's the idea behind these reviews, I guess, to get a broad view of public opinion.  Well, here's mine:  I don't think they worked very hard on this one.  It seemed to me like a low budget production. I hate to make negative comments on anybody's creative effort, but when I compare it with the other series out there, I have to say I don't think they tried very hard, or maybe they underestimated their competition.",Negative
"""cry baby island"" is what this show should be called. Add in a lot of fake drama & overacting, one ends up with a semi-entertaining show.",Negative
"First, I wish I could rate a product, TV show or movie without having to write a full review for it.  That said, this series is very good.  It is well written -- not formulaic at all.  The plot, timing and characters pull you into caring about the main group of survivors.  The apocalypse is actually believable, if treated just a bit too quickly.  I'm now up to the fourth in this series.",Positive
Great storyline. The actors were chosen for their roles very well.  Even though it is about zombies it's well written and well acted.,Positive
Love this show. Wish it had continued,Positive
Robertsons  are a really neat family and I enjoy there show so much I will tell everybody about it.Where is season 4  bring it on..,Positive
"I loved it -- haven't enjoyed a show this much in decades!  One of the funniest sitcoms I have ever seen.  It's even funnier than the Onion News itself.  Sly, irreverent -- looks like nothing will be sacred (but let's hope they learned where to draw the line after the Oscar fiasco).",Positive
"To me a comedy is REALLY funny or it misses all together. This one made me laugh. It is not a guaranteed winner, that will be up to the writers, but it has all the makings. More!",Positive
"I know these guys get flack for always driving cars most people cannot afford. But actually how much can you talk about a bland $20000 sedan? When I was a kid I thought about cars I probably would never own. But its always fun to see what they can do. I don't watch Top Gear to decide which $100,000 car I want. I watch them to see if they think its worth it.  I especially like their quests to explore roads not so traveled. Or destinations not really on a map. I have watched them so long now, I even get the British language now!",Positive
I'm glad to see Kate Mulgrew was added to the cast! Miss seeing her in Star Trek Voyager! I really like this bizarre series and all the weird stuff they encounter.. interesting to watch!,Positive
"While many Darcys are merely wooden, you can see the progression of emotions on Firth's face before he speaks. And he still manages to make you like him, even while he is acting like a pompous ass.",Positive
Have enjoyed the unexpected turns that this series takes - very unexpected - which keeps my interest! Have enjoyed watching it all in order!,Positive
"I absolutely love Jim Caviezal's dark, somewhat tortured soul who seeks to help those the government have labeled &#34;irrelevant.&#34;  With politics in the state that it is today, we sit right at the edge of fiction and reality.  I rather hope this story premise leans into the reality.",Positive
Not too great a story. Lots of overacting. I have followed other series with more enthusiasm but will check out Season 2 to see if things get better.,Negative
"Season 3 is much easier to use because CBS Video has splurged on the Play All function and subtitles.  I started to like NCIS with the introduction of Cote de Pablo who looks like a cross between Winona Ryder and Salma Hayek.  This is the season with the ""homos on the train"" line.",Positive
My grandson watches Wonder Pets on my iPad and just loves this show.  He sings along with the characters and just loves animals.,Positive
Good casting great story one of the best tv series to date. I must but for any tv show fan!,Positive
There are some pretty dark elements to this film that make perfect riffing material. B-rate horror at its finest makes for some good jokes.,Positive
I was really hoping this would be more similar to the original &#34;Once Upon a Time.&#34; I've not been impressed with the storylines or characters. Kind of a disappointment. :(,Negative
"I think Falling Skies is falling. The plot took a turn and now Earth has enemies within and three outside trying to get in. Special effects are still good. But the dirt bike scenes appeared he was riding at about 5 miles per hour. OK, now those scenes were cheesy. The little girl growing up and becoming a savior, maybe, or the opposite. The writers usually fall short in a lot of series about the fourth season. Let's see if they can pull their act together. The actors are all still doing a great job.",Negative
A weird crazy mix of sex and craziness Oh and the Devil too ! Not really scary but had an interesting vibe throughout.,Negative
"I knew nothing about this going in but enjoyed the film immensely. The actors were solid, the effects impressive enough, and the story was tense and emotional.  Watch a group of astronauts make discoveries on a moon of Jupiter called Europa.",Positive
"Last year the entertainment world hit a major road block. Movies were put on hold and television shows were asked to cut their seasons short. Many dissapointed fans were very upset and of course what do they do they point their fingers are the wrong people.One of the shows that unfortunatly went down hard in the writters strike was Heroes. After an incredible first season we were left with an extremly short second season with a sub-par plot. Blame the big heads of entertainment, blame writters, heck blame all the people that destoryed our economy, but don't take it out on the people we tune into every monday night to see their adventures. I have to give Tim Kring and company an A for effort as they managed to fit an entire story into a span of 12 episodes, that's as long as an  entire season on HBO people! I loved the new characters that they brought into the show like Maya and Elle. Of course I will watch Kristen Bell even if it was her on a cheesy reality show. I loved how they brought us inside the Company and showed us the origins of how and why it was formed. I think the only downside for me was Peter's story in the whole second season. I do beleive if they had entire 22 episode season there would have been much more to his story. Now as we are about so enter Season 3 dubed 'Villians' I feel that Heroes will be back in it's groove and redeem the show bringing it back to it's awesome glory.",Positive
"This is such a great show. I know two types of people, those who hate it and those who love it. Since my husband and I lived in New York it is very easy to identify yourself with the characters. We have watched and re watched the seasons because they never get old.",Positive
"The entire cast is great - Mammie is definitely the linchpin of the show. She's funny, expressive and a natural actress. Love the story lines. Hope it gets picked up!!",Positive
"This one is worth a shot. I'm a big fan of the IT Crowd and I was expecting a rip-off, but the concept of Betas seems fresh, and not too overly geeky.",Positive
"My husband and I really enjoy this show.  We like the mystery they solve, the many twists and turns in the plot, even the humor.  The lead character is quirky and even believable considering he survived 12 years in prison as a convicted cop.  His search for the &#34;real&#34; killers of the crime he was convicted for is very convoluted and involves his partner's father.  The production quality is very good.  Even though it is a crime show  (murder) , we don't feel depressed after watching.  It doesn't dwell on the gory.  I recommend this show.  Wish there were more episodes.  (We have been out of the country since 2007 so missed show when originally ran.)",Positive
"I wondered how they would continue the story, but I have not been disappointed so far. I like their take on Peter Pan and one of my favorite characters (Mr. Gold/Rumpelstiltskin) never fails to entertain and impress. I also like the effort to humanize the villains a little bit more, which keeps them complex. The stories of Hook and Tinkerbell are particularly interesting. Can hardly wait to see more!",Positive
"I have long had an interest in the history of England between the fall of the Roman empire and the time of the Tudor dynasty. I am aware of the affects that the Vikings had on English history, but not that well informed about the Vikings themselves. The creators of this series appear to have done a decent amount of research into Viking culture and the driving forces behind their expansion to the west. While the first season has made a good start, it remains to be seen if the writers can keep it up. One more reason to wish that season 2 was available already.",Positive
"Though Louie CK clearly has a degree of talent, He relies much too heavily on emphasis on sexual matters.  It actually detracts from his abilities as a comedienne.  The man had a story to tell, but the plethora of sexual remarks clouded the narrative.I would not recommend this series unless you have a high tolerance for what I consider offensive language when it is used so freely.",Negative
"I gave it this rating for many reasons, it was a good season to watch and it keeps the viewer interested.",Positive
"i love this show....great action, great characters, and ZOMBIES!  what more do you need?  this show should last a long time....i hope",Positive
"This is the best vampire writing since Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.  The only show that comes close is Dracula, staring Jonathan Rhys Meyers.I really empathize with these characters and their situations.  Great cast! great acting! and great writing.",Positive
For those of you that stayed with the show through Season 1 your reward comes in Season 2.  Go ahead and buy the whole season because it doesn't conclude until the very last show.  It's worth it.  I don't know how.  A ginger in the lead and a partner who epitomizes a meth-head should not have a great cop show by any formula I can understand!!  It was so worth it to buy both seasons!  Enjoy.  You will not figure it out until the end.,Positive
"This is a twisted movie, so don't go in expecting something thought provoking or a traditional horror flick. It's mostly a comedy. I was more amused than scared. It goes over the top quite a bit, but it's designed that way. Some of the characters are hilarious, like the two chain smoking priests, and the &#34;neighbor&#34; who lives in the crawlspace of the innocent couple who move into the haunted house. The main character is also quite funny. A super nice guy who tries to make the best of things, no matter how bizarre they get. This movie goes from absurd to ridiculous, and is a perfect fit for people who like this type of entertainment, like a Monty Python, or Team America fan.",Positive
"As good if not better than Covert Affairs or Person of Interest  and Rizzoli & Iyles but with far more interesting characters and storylines. Strikes a nice balance between mystery and humor and the frustrations of love. The Networks are too busy with reality tv CW, Netflix, Amazon HULU make this happen. One refreshing note among many, how realistic to see Logan put his hand on the wall when they we r e going to kiss after he embraced her. Instead of the usual &#34;slam her head against the wall&#34; (Arrow). Not being familiar with the show, I robowatched the 3 seasons on Amazon Prime and then opted to purchase the movie on Instant Video to watch at my leisure. It's great to be able to buy a movie while it's in the theater.",Positive

"Season after season this show delivers!  I like that this contest moves along quickly.  It's very satisfying to see each challenge completed.  It's fascinating to see what these professional chefs can do in such short time with such odd ingredients.  The show focuses on the actual cooking with just enough exposition of the contestants' lives.  The judges are very good with insightful critiques of each dish.  Also, I get ideas of flavorful combinations that I never would have thought of on my own.",Positive

This is a nice updated take on Sherlock Holmes and Watson. It has good stories and is well acted -- an enjoyable TV show.,Positive
Love the way this series draws you deeper into the world of the characters and stays fresh by always adding new elements and surprises.,Positive
I purchased this for my sister. She was sick and missed a show so I bought this show for her to catch up.,Positive
"there are some pretty good episodes in this season, but the only thing is it is the same exact one's they show on cable, I hate that I spend money on this, its season 25 and they only have like seasons 19-25, what the hell happened to the first 18 seasons then??? that's ridiculous seriouslyevery week I remember one of my new or old favorite tv shows that I want to watch so I come onto amazon to buy the season....after this bull though, im done, not going to be buying anything from amazon streaming anymore now.amazon wants to be so stupid and cheap to have seasons 19-25 but not the first 18, that's what happens when your cheap!! people leave and take their money with them",Negative
This show is full of great British humor with an excellent cast and exception writers. I return to this series often and the humor never subsides.  Don't turn it off while the credits are running because it isn't over.  There is one list bit you need to see at the very end.  I wish this show could have gone on for many more seasons.,Positive
"This is based on a true fact of Chinese history, and John Woo, a master at film-making, has taken full advantage of computer-generated skill to present us with vast armies, flotillas of warships and - of course - one of his favorite stars, Jet Li.The film is awesome and spectacular, and no one has mastered the concept of a moving camera as well. Gone is the stationary tripod, and Woo keeps his camera hovering over and around his characters almost constantly. This is an epic winner.",Positive
"I rented this because it had an interesting premise.  I think they could've done more with this.  I really wanted to like it, but I was mostly bored.",Negative
"My granddaughter loves this show with all the music and dancing, I personally don't care for it, I think it hits the teen age better",Positive
"Very entertaining, funny, serious, some violence, some sleaze, not too much filthy talk..there are bedroom scenes, and killings too.Blend of city and country, and a mix of racism in it too.Can't stop watching.Won't pay $1.99 an episode, but will watch free on prime.Can't wait for next season to be released for prime viewing.",Positive
"I recomemnd this programme to anyone who likes Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is a police procedural elevated to a highly enjoyable level by the game of wits between Patrick Jane/Sherlock Holmes and Red John/Moriarty. It is my sincere hope that the final clash between Jane and Red John is a confrontation comparable to the final confrontation between Holmes and Moriarty. There are so many parallels between Patrick Jane and Sherlock Holmes that my review would be over long. However, The Mentalist is the best of the Sherlock Holmes inspired take-offs for either movies, TV or literature. So, let it suffice to say that if you like the quirky, brilliant and driven Sherlock Holmes you are going to love quirky, brilliant and driven Patrick Jane of The Mentalist. Long live Sherlock Holmes. Long live The Mentalist.",Positive
I put off watching this show even though my kid told me it was addictive....this show had me hooked from the beginning,Positive
Now that the last episode is out we can hardly wait to see thee the fate of old Walter White. I hope Jesse gets him if anybody does.,Positive
Blue's Clues keeps the toddler's attention while appropriate teaching lessons for their age group. My grandson watches them over and over.,Positive
I love Lucy and they make a great team!  It's a little predictable but still entertaining and do look forward to watching it each week.  I'm also glad that it has more than 13 episodes to a season.,Positive
"I really like spy vs. spy fantasy.  That's what &#34;The Americans Season 2&#34; is.  It has just enough &#34;reality&#34; to it to keep things interesting.  Issues that are obvious if you wanted to pay serious attention are easily overlooked, e.g. the children appear when needed, otherwise the parents are free to do whatever &#34;the center&#34; directs.  Kind of like Mission Impossible on speed.",Positive
"The cast is believable, the acting is excellent.  I dislike the easy hook-up culture portrayed.  As an observant Jewish woman, I'm dismayed at the casual sex.  I do like the relationships, and generally that Mindy is kind, funny, assertive.  I do think she sets herself up for being hurt by asking that midwife, for example, to 'hookup' with her.",Negative
"It doesn't get any better throughout the entire movie. The characters are so flat, one-dimensional, and I didn't care what happened to any of them.",Negative
I thought the pilot was great.  I love the mystery that the characters have to figure out and that some big things were revealed yet other points where made but not really discovered. I can't wait for the rest of this show.,Positive
"In line with the other seasons, Season 4 is well written and the cast is stellar.  This season, Raylen appears to be pushing the line of law officer versus criminal to its breaking point.  Will Ava's secret be discovered?  Will she go to jail?  Will Boyd win his battle against the rich criminals &#34;on the hill&#34;?  Will Raylen become a daddy and live happily ever after?  Will Raylen finally make peace with his daddy?  Will Raylen get to Drew Thompson before Boyd?  Will Raylen or Boyd get to Drew Thompson before the boys from Detroit get him? Will Ellen May find freedom and safety or wind up in a mine shaft like so many before her? These are just a few of the questions that are answered by the time Season 4 wraps up.  It's a busy season and the final moments are sure not to disappoint.",Positive
"Throughout all of filmdom, there's some debate about when the cop buddy film actually came about.  Most critics seem to accept that the contemporary version of it was a product of 1970's and 1980's filmmaking, and I figure that's probably more right than wrong.  If the buddy film didn't originate somewhere in those two eras, it certainly made its most significant step forward culturally during that time.  That said, JAVA HEAT feels more like the outcome of someone trying to recapture that dynamic for an all-new generation of movie-goers.  While some may find that admirable, I'd just rather go back and re-watch all the great buddy films of the past than have to sit through an inferior retread any day of the week.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Jake Wilde (played with `beginner's luck' by TWILIGHT's Kellan Lutz) is a teacher's assistant who finds himself in the most unlikely set of circumstances one could imagine: he survived a terrorist's bombing in Indonesia and is how having to be a witness for local detective Hashim (Ario Bayu).  But Jake's problem isn't the attack; rather, it's that he's not who he says he is, and the two men will have to join forces in order to stop a terrorist named Malik (Mickey Rourke) from absconding with `the Crown Jewels' and a beautiful sultan princess he intends to sell into sexual slavery!And therein lies the chief problem behind so very much of JAVA HEAT: its patchwork story.  None of these characters - not Jake, not Hashim, and not Malik - are every clearly defined so that an audience can either understand much less identify with them.  First, Jake's a teaching assistant; then he's some international FBI terrorism expert; then he's some AWOL military policeman.  As best as I can honestly tell you, his last identity is the only one that sticks; it's finally made perfectly clear in the film's closing sequence, but, by that point, should I or anyone really care?Stylistically, it's hard figuring out what to make of JAVA HEAT.  Its performances are stereotypical and predictable; its action pieces have all been done before; and its message of East triumphing over West appears as if it can only happen these days in similar cinematic fairy tales.  Its story is all over the map in terms of indicting the global society on behalf of the Indonesian people, and that's probably just what writer/director Conor Allyn intended: convince everyone that anyone but the Muslims are to blame for the shape our world is in, and you've done not only a good thing but also the right thing.  Has he and his co-writer Rob Allyn never heard about Sharia Law?  Oh, pardon me for perhaps stating the obvious because anyone with half-a-heart and a motion picture production crew knows better.Unfortunately, so much of JAVA plays out like a bad cup of coffee.  What little story there is makes no sense, and I have to wonder how much of this was actually left on the cutting room floor.  I say that because there's a scene about thirty minutes in wherein Lutz's character says to Bayu's character, ""Hey, didn't we do great teamwork back there?""  (I'm paraphrasing.)  He's also given his Indonesian counterpart the nickname of `Hash' (short for Hashim).  The chief problem with this sequence is that we've yet to see these two actually work together in any way, shape, or form.  Clearly, something has been either removed to give this exchange its meaning or something went completely unfilmed; and a competent filmmaker and/or editor would've noticed the obvious storytelling gaffe and actually done something to fix it so that the narrative made sense.  It doesn't, and I spent the rest of the film realizing that this may've been by design as the script feels like a visual stew: it's all chocked full with scenes, plots, and characters excised from vastly superior films.Methinks the filmmakers hope the audience isn't watching too closely; that way, they're much more likely to enjoy JAVA HEAT.  They'll be stupefied to the action, or the young ladies will be suffering the vapors from seeing Lutz's naked body.  Me?  I just wanted it to, at some point, start to make some narrative sense.  Instead, it ends up feeling about 104 minutes way too long.JAVA HEAT is produced by Margate House Films and Margate House (???) along with some participation by IM Global and Zero Gravity Management.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group and IFC Films.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds pretty solid, though there's a measure loss of audio quality in a few scenes (not a huge distraction).  Also, the film played as an ""Official Selection"" of the Dallas International and Taormina Film Festivals.  As is often the case with these smaller releases, there are no major special features to speak of save a short `making of' featurette and the theatrical trailer.MILDLY RECOMMENDED.  Despite a lack of effort, JAVA HEAT isn't entirely a complete waste.  Granted, that may not be saying much, but it's the truth.  Stylistically, it's a throwback to a time when action films were a bit kinder and gentler.  I've no doubt it'll impress audiences who don't look too closely; my problem may very well be that I do look closely, especially when it comes to storytelling.  Still, this is a Hollywood wet dream: the bad guys are the Americans, the French, and the Chinese, while those Sharia-lovin' Muslims are all just misunderstood by the rest of the world.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at IFC Films provided me with a DVD copy of JAVA HEAT by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",Negative
"The end of the third series had been dramatic with the killing of Mitchell by George. But nothing is simple in this fourth series. Nina has disappeared because after giving birth to a girl she does not have time to name she is destroyed by some vampiristic mob. George is paranoid about the prediction that the baby is the saviour of humanity and has to be killed by the vampires when they come to take over the world, he understands it as if she had to be killed for vampires to be able to take over. He is unable to survive very long in that paranoia and thus he leaves Annie and the baby with an unfinished job, in his mind at least. If he knew the truth he would really be frightened. But the house is a real crossroads for vampires, werewolves and ghosts, provided they are all detached from the real monstrous things they may represent and they are trying to live human lives.A young werewolf comes back, Tom , and he is known of us so he is easily accepted and integrated even before George disappears. But he is still a kid and he has to learn how to fight and kill vampires since werewolves have that divine task to do.The vampire is more difficult to find. He is Hal, but in fact this is a nickname and they learn in due time he is an old one who has decided to leave the flock and wean himself, which he has been doing for fifty five years now, a short time after all when compared to the extreme length of his living dead survival he calls a life.  And being this old one he is also the future king of the vampires when they take the world over. He is Prince Harry, a common name for a prince since Shakespeare and quite popular nowadays.But this series has a new tone in a way because it is the series in which the old ones are coming to take over the world and they have to be destroyed. But the problem is the prediction. The baby called Eve by George on his death bed is the saviour of humanity. But is she the one who can protect humanity by being alive against the vampires? Or is she the one who can stop and destroy all the old ones by dying? Or is she the one who can open the gates to vampires by dying? The same question is at the heart of these questions: must Eve live and protect humanity or die and save humanity as well as destroy the old ones?In fact this question is not even accurate. Little by little we know the baby Eve has to die but the real question is how? Especially when the ghost of an eighteen year old Eve comes up into the picture to explain to Annie why she, Eve, must die.Of course it is all more complicated than that and our three main heroes will be joined by the ghost of Alex, a girl Hal had courted a little bit and who was killed by a certain Cutler, a vampire obsessed by making history and who trapped Harry into drinking her blood, which send Harry back on a frenzy of submissiveness to the oldest one of them all, the one from whom all vampire DNA comes and who finally arrives on earth to fulfil the prophecy.To spice up the tale we have flash-forwards into the future as it is going to be if the vampires take over. Something pretty scary since human beings will have to be eliminated except the number necessary to feed the vampires. Humanity will become the bleeding cattle of the newcomers. This is very similar to the means used in other series or in novels to achieve the same objective: to make the heroes save the present because there is no future without a present that is alive and well. I am thinking of Terminator of course, the whole saga, including the TV series of the John Connor's mother's diaries. I am thinking of Supernatural in which angels and archangels send the heroes Dean and Sam into the future the way it would be if they did not accept to play the game of the Apocalypse. I am thinking of many science-fiction books by Stephen King and others, including Ron L. Hubbard, that use the vision of the future to make us understand that we have to save the present.But here the present can only be saved by Annie, Tom and Hal. And it is saved of course, and the baby is sacrificed to save humanity. And it is the fire of god that does the business. They forgot to tell us clearly that this fire came from god but we can subsume it all by ourselves, can't we? The old ones will be destroyed of course because there are two ways to destroy vampires, a stake in the heart or fire. Now you have to watch the eight episodes if you want to know how and where and when and by whom.Three survivors: Hal, Tom and Alex, a phenomenal m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois with an immediate emergency: to wean Hal from his having drunk some blood. We also discover another type of humans, but are they humans, people or beings who are supposed to keep the secret hidden and to collect all the evidence they can and that could reveal that secret to the world: the world is under the menace from vampires and among us we have quite a few vampires and werewolves. Those we can see, though the vampires are invisible in mirrors and cameras and telephone webcams, etc. The third type of monsters, if they are monsters of course, are ghosts and those are invisible, sorry folks, there must always be a cheater somewhere in any games and ghosts are the cheaters, and we are the losers of course.Who will win in the next series? The vampires, the werewolves or the ghosts? I am ready to bet on werewolves because they are sexy animals, whereas ghosts are immaterial and vampires are killing machines and blood suckers. Though the series is discreet about the intimate life of the heroes, when speaking of suction, there is better and more pleasurable things to do than suck blood. At least George was a practising believer as for that.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Positive

Exciting drama with great acting and thought-provoking story lines. I can't wait to watch more. I am so glad that my brother recommended it to me.,Positive
I love it. It has a lot of action and drama in it. I would recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks,Positive
"The series is in the older square video version.  Made for the older TV types, but it's still a great series.  Inspirational and mind boggling.  Some of the amazing things they come up with are absolutely incredible.",Positive
"I know I'm &#34;supposed&#34; to like thew characters of Harvey and Mike best, but Louis Litt is my favorite just because he's so weird and sometimes evil.  However, the newness is wearing off & I'm getting bored with the Harvey who can do no wrong and Mike who can do no right routine.  I wish they'd develop those characters more.",Negative
"There is nothing ever like the real thing.  It is a good crime drama series, and Mary McDonald does a wonderful job, especially with that worriesome Rusty always barging in at the worst time.  Rusty, like everyone else, is a legacy of Kyra Sedwick.  The cast are carrying on very well without her, but it would be great if she would put in an appearance once in a while.  I wish the &#34;new&#34; Capitain would get knocked down a peg or two.  He is too smug for me.",Positive
Very entertaining. The characters almost have you rooting for the &#34;other side&#34;.  A KGB couple that is hiding in plain sight.,Positive

"WARNING: As a conscientious reviewer, I always add a warning to my reviews when there's clearly a campaign to down-vote anything critical. Shame on the voters who do this instead of considering an opinion, and shame on Amazon for expecting me to take my precious time to write a good review only to allow this type of shilling activity with the votes.GHOST MINE ~ general review which I'm putting under this particular episode, seasons 1 (2012) & 2 (2013) is yet another paranormal TV show I watch in order to relax and perhaps obtain a laugh or two. I chanced upon it while I was enjoying the obviously phony shenanigans of DEEP SOUTH PARANORMAL (see my review:Dead On The Bayouwhich is the only episode I was able to review).There is an important preface I think I should add. While the wife and I enjoy paranormal shows as popcorn entertainment and to get a few laughs, we're under no illusions as to their reality. In other words, we know these shows are all 100% fake (though I admit I'm a sucker for PSYCHIC KIDS). They hire actors for these shows, rarely any genuine non-actors. We see the bad acting in every episode; we often recognize the actors as being from other shows.Here it must be obvious the show deals with a haunted mine. This program appears to be influenced by the cynical personality who 'co-hosts' the show, paranormal investigator Patrick Doyle. While stiff as a board with about as much personality, Patrick is a fascinating creature. He is well known for his internet presence as a skeptic and harsh critic of paranormal shows. Recently his internet presence has vanished.So, he and his partner-in-spook-detection, Kristen Lumen (a skittish B-movie actress and hypnotherapist not to be confused with actresses Kristin Lehman or Kristen Lowman) both attached themselves to a gold-mining crew in Sumpter, Oregon. The mine, up in the Elk Horn Mountains, is called The Crescent, yields pretty pathetic gold, but BOY!!--is it ever haunted.The question with GHOST MINE is not whether the whole thing is fake, but rather: How many of the miners are real miners, and if there are real miners on there, how did they get mixed up in this fakery? As to Patrick Doyle (a former skeptic and hater of paranormal shows) and Kristen Lumen (a/k/a Kristen Luman, an awful B-movie bit-player) ... well, show me a paranormal show that DOESN'T have such people. They've got to earn a living!Yet Patrick and Kristen saw fit to attempt to erase their internet presence before going on GHOST MINE. Why do that? To generate publicity? You can't hardly erase your entire net presence, and Kristen is easy to find on the Internet Movie Database while Patrick has left huge footprints all over the web erasing his old skeptical web videos. Food for thought, readers.One thing I already knew which this show exposes is the horrific treatment of Chinese miners from the mid-19th century. There is an episode from season 2 (Massacre at Hell's Canyon) in which Patrick and Kristen travel up a river where several dozen Chinese miners were slaughtered.That is the 'spook-hook': it has to be those poor Chinese miners haunting the area. I watch this show mainly for the miners and their work. The show has an obnoxious soap opera tactic: you're left hanging at the end of each show, basically forcing you to wait a week just to discover what the hell happened. Without spoiling, I can reveal that it does resolve itself--pretty shabbily but dramatically--at the end of season 2 which just aired (I think the week of November 18, 2013).While I enjoy and even learn from watching the miners, I get bored as stiff as Patrick Doyle's lack of personality from watching the investigations. Patrick somehow keeps up his robotic lack of personality while Kristen unashamedly screeches at any little noise. It is pointless to name and describe the mining crew, which I suppose is just another mining crew. However, if they were real miners, I somehow doubt they'd accept a paycheck to be put into THIS kind of chum bucket.My wife and I have spotted (besides the lugubrious and annoying Kristen) at least three actors we have seen in other paranormal TV shows. However, when I think of the way pioneers in true adventure-expidition documentaries, like Marlin Perkins and Jacques Cousteau, also faked some of their material, well ... there's got to be some fakery, it's TV.At least Perkins and Cousteau were doing real work and bringing us real footage. I warn my readership to avoid wasting money on GHOST MINE. Watch it for free on cable and decide for yourselves. What the heck, one day Patrick might actually show some emotion or at least some life behind those shifty eyes--and Kristen might just finally learn how to act!What is occurring with these shows is sad. These shows are being put out there with the claim they are ""reality""--in other words, DOCUMENTARIES. If an advertised documentary is not a documentary, then it is a fraud. Jacques Cousteau and Marlin Perkins faked some footage in every show they ever did, but they always admitted it; they were not trying to deceive their audiences.The true problem is we have a law that says there has to be a disclaimer that a show is for entertainment only, which signals that it is a faked show. That law seems to have simply fallen by the wayside--has everyone forgotten the Miss Cleo debacle? Or is it that everyone wants to forget! The disclaimer law I reference was a direct result of Miss Cleo's exposure.GHOST MINE has its strong points, and I have confirmed these by closely studying fan reactions on the internet. It seems the main catch that makes GHOST MINE unique and very popular is that it is essentially a soap opera. We know it is fake, but that's not always totally obvious--and that deceives people. Even so, we know how much we like it, and people described how they got hooked on the show.In other words, the people who put this together were raising the bar for these kinds of shows. Yet they also threw in with the other pathetic fraudsters who claim their shows are 100% real. I am a fan ofPsychic Kids: Children of the Paranormalbecause at least the children on that show seem genuine. Notice I wrote ""seem genuine"".I'm the first person to admire and applaud innovation--I even established a new branch of anthropology, called ""cinemanthropology"", to study tv/movie entertainment and its impact on human culture. What I deplore is the dishonesty, the fraudulent tactic, of passing off such work as journalistic-documentary work.Mine is not difficult logic: fraud is fraud, it's still illegal as far as I understand it, it cheapens/ruins what little integrity television has left, and (perhaps least of all) it insults everyone. As far as I can tell, GHOST MINE has never had any disclaimer nor have they made an effort to present one after the fact. Don't you think all of that places GHOST MINE and all the other paranormal shows in a kind of unacceptable jeopardy?",Negative
"Few tv shows can hold my interest and make me continue to care about the characters for as long as a 10th season.  Grey's Anatomy continues to entertain and make me want to see more.  Nothing stale and worn with this show, in fact Season 10 may be better than some of the earlier seasons.",Positive
Finally something new to watch that was funny and poignant. And with the potential to include some great music. One hopes that if this goes into production that they'll be careful to explore the unique and individual characters they've introduced and not report to stereotypes.,Positive
This is an interesting program. The trials and tribulations of starting an internet business by a group of geeks. I liked it immediately.,Positive
"Annoying, self-important characters except for the father (a very good actor no matter what he is in). A show that panders to Gen-X. Plods along at an equally self-important pace, smug to say the least. Sure to capture a girl on girl demographic as well. Probably the end result of a linear optimization exercise to try and pander to all demographics hoping that something will stick.",Negative

"I really was not sure about this show, but I was hooked like 15 minutes into the first episode. It has everything a new show should: Suspense, Drama, Love, Violence and so on and so forth. I am highly pleased with this.",Positive
"I enjoy this show, although I think the romantic (or sexual) tension between the lead actors is not there.  The female lead is leading the male around by the nose.  I do not truly enjoy a weak man, but that's just me.  I like the detecting portion of the show, and the other characters are great.  The female boss, the intern and the morgue doctor are great characters.  The detective is fun, when he is not with the female lead.",Positive
"This season seemed a little bit lackluster in the fact that they ONLY made monsters. There was no beauty in this season. The challenges seemed to sort of blur together because it was more of the same. Also, the special immunity the judges gave seemed a bit superfluous. It let a contestant hang on and end up eliminated anyway.",Positive
wonderful to be able to rewatch this great series season by season and see the characters change.  Thanks so much,Positive
"this is a well crafted but otherwise unremarkable film. statham veered for a while into kickboxing capers with strong third world potential, but this film (and ""parker"" even more) suggest he is trying to carry his brand into more substantial roles. it has most of the standard action film elements -- rising from degradation to heroism, a forbidden romance that has no future, the revenge of an innocent's death at the hands of an evil man, and a few well choreographed villain stomping sequences -- but the film has the relaxed pace of a romantic drama, and statham shows he can project a range of complex emotions with strength and understatement. he and the director seem to have really clicked, the pairing with the luminous and birdlike agata buzek creates an unusually interesting romantic subplot (especially as both are haunted by the past), and the cinematography, alternating between darkness and light, skillfully responds to the moods of the story.",Negative
I'm a politics junkie and enjoyed watching the make believe fantasy lighter personal side of politicians that this series portrays.,Positive
"Rich Johnson (Cam Gigandet) is the type of player everyone of us knows. He allows his little head to do all his thinking for him. Rich makes a wish for his life to change, at which point his &#34;little head&#34; becomes detached and its own person (Nick Thune). Bad Johnson becomes out of control and makes Rich's life miserable creating oodles of symbolism, metaphors and puns.The overall problem with the film is the juvenile nature of the topic exceeded the comedy. Not as bad as an Adam Sandler film. It did have a few good enjoyable scenes, but overall, the film is just a rental to watch and forget.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity.",Negative
Ok so I had to update all of my blu ray players just to get the disc to work. It still won't work on my Sony blu ray player. No idea why. I don't want to spend fifty dollars on it at a store to try a different one when I waited over a week for it to arrive after I preordered it a month early.

I liked the interplay between King and Maxwell. The plots were interesting. The action was at times a bit excessive. But i would definitely buy season 2 except that the series was cancelled for season 2.,Positive
"This show continues with great performances, character development, and a sense of being able to make fun of itself, while remaining serious about its storyline.  I recommend start with season 1 and following the drama from the beginning.  Can't say enough about the writing, and choice of cast.  It is a great way to take your mind off of you problems and office politics at work.  Enjoy!!",Positive

"If you've seen any of the previous seasons before than you know pretty much what to expect from it,  basically you have about fifteen contestant wannabe chefs each vying for the prize of being the head chef of a renown restaurant but they must first pass Chef Gordon Ramsay's cuisine qualifications first.  The one thing I have to say that I feel anyone can tell is that these supposed chefs aren't chefs at all,  we have one contestant supposedly who had almost eight years of culinary skills and they still couldn't cook a steak right?  If you want to actually see real chefs check out the cooking channels Iron Chef this show is just about a bunch of wannabes trying to pretend to be good cooks just for their fifteen minutes of fame and a chance for a comfy position,  I mean you can't help but laugh as Ramsays tears into the contestants as they spoil the entrees and dishes in rather spectacular style most of the times and you can't help but laugh as some of the impostor chefs mess up their cooking from mashed potatoes to salads.  At the end it really isn't so much about the contestants but just watching as Ramsays goes about criticizing the ineptitude of these fake chefs,  and while it's enjoyable it also becomes annoying too somewhat as you watch the background backstabbing of these people when they're forced to choose someone for elimination from the show.  So if you're looking for a soap opera cooking show with lots of shouting, bad cooking, and basically lousy chefs here's the one for you but for a true cooking show challenge Iron Chef is really the only way to go...",Positive
"This could have been so much better. The filmmaker has an Organic Industry bias that is very difficult to over come, but at least you were warned up front. It would have been nice to have more of the chemical use exposed as well as what these &#34;organic approved&#34; chemicals are doing to pollute our water and soils. There is the wrong belief that just because it is &#34;natural&#34; and might have come from a food (e.g. lemon juice) it is harmless.  This is so far from the truth as these &#34;organic approved&#34; chemicals typically need to be applied in such high volumes to provide even moderate protection that we are seeing acidification of soils and ground water contamination.It would have been nice to expose the GMO hypocrisy as well as large scale &#34;organic&#34; farms do use seeds that have been genetically modified to ripen faster, have a more consistent size, shape, and color.  I was very glad to see them give a few minutes to imported &#34;organics&#34; and how they might not be so &#34;organic&#34;.  It was good that they drove home the point that Organic Foods is a marketing scheme, not a reality. Sadly, they toned down this reality by &#34;interviewing&#34; certified so-called organic farmers who over and over stated they are pure organic farmers and that the consumer needs to believe in the certificate.The solution is to grow what you can and get to know your local produce farmer and if you like their methods buy from them. Do not buy organics that come from Big Ag or that are imported. And for your own health and safety, do not buy leafy foods labeled organic from grocery stores. Buy these only from well known local suppliers. Lastly, understand that if a chemical is killing a pest, it is harmful to the environment. It does not matter if that chemical comes from Dow Chemicals or a tonne of lemons.",Negative

"Chris Carter knows how to make good cinema... especially for TV consumption. The After offers some promising plot lines as the &#34;eight&#34; prepare for heaven's knows what... and therein lies the problem, the &#34;heavens knows what.&#34; An engaging premise for the chaotic surroundings is absent... in spite of the fear such brings to the leads, there had to be some form of explanation at the close of this pilot to ensure continued interest by the viewer. That, quite simply, was lacking&#8212;there's no cause for continued watching&#8212;viewers need to feel some form of empathy to continue to engage interest in the characters. Perhaps there are too many of them, perhaps they are too similar, but there's no perhaps over the fact that the conditions do not drive additional interest in this potential series. Carter can do far better than this...",Negative
A look inside the person & organization. Another Masterpiece from the UK.  A most watch series. Gritty at times but realistic. A must Watch for the purist. Recommended W/O reservation.,Positive
"We have been watching this show since the beginning and continue to get a kick out of how fairy tales and other familiar stories are rebooted and rejuvenated.  Sometimes the writers' inventiveness seems to wear thin and episodes get rather soap opera-like, but in general the episodes are rewarding, with twists and turns in the plot that keep you hooked without feeling too ridiculous. That said, so far the WWTW is our least favorite villain... definitely looking forward to the end of this story arc.",Positive
Lousy beyond belief but I'll probably keep watching out of a morbid sense of curiosity. I guess THE AFTER qualifies as camp.,Negative
Emily continues down her path to clear her father's name and is letting nothing get in her way!  One of the better shows on Television!!,Positive
"I felt thoroughly ripped off with this film. It was infantile, stupid, tedious and embarrassing.The special effects were laughable.",Negative
"To me this season is better than season 3...again, this is a clever adult cartoon that is very funny...not for kids...watch it and laugh out loud!",Positive
"Well, you hooked me. When the show finished I really wanted to find out what is going to happen with both major issues presented in the pilot. I hope &#34;Herschel&#34; plays a bigger part in upcoming episodes, I love the actor and his character is perfect for him.",Positive
"Sorry....Im a fanatic for all period pieces series and movies...O>M>G>~~~watched the first episode...its okay if your naive, romantically starved, or a teenager and your idea of true love and history is the TWILIGHT saga....really...Costumes were a bit over the top,something Calvin Klein designed for everyone....the teenage girls hair...come on....no one spoke that way, women didnt wear their hair like that yet...the makeup...the teenage pajama parties.....Really?THEYRE ALL SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!! my goodness....Like I said...if you're very young, a new viewer to period drama, or just like watching perfect bosoms and cut young dudes run around, or just ""in love with love""..Go ahead enjoy...Nothing wrong with that, ever.......BUT, if you want to view a piece worthwhile view Elizabeth with Anne-marie Duff, from BBC...or last years Vikings from the History channel....even Duchess, the movie.M.P.P.script: THEY SHOULD HAVE STAYED ""BEHIND THE THRONE""..FOR TEENAGE VIEWING ONLY.",Negative
Just wasn't that good. The dialog was very predictable and the actor who played Bosch just doesn't work as a star. I doubt that I would make this part of my regular viewing.,Negative

"You have to use a more creative word than, 'nice'.  Good 4 Star rating for a free Amazon Prime movie you never heard of. If it were a major release movie, 3 -- maybe, 2 stars. Very dysfunctional family who are fun to watch. The lead male is fun to watch and see how he keeps his awkward, stiff, stoic personality even when he's put in awkward situations by the free-spirited cute neighbor who asks him to write her obit. The family cast members are amusing and surprising.",Positive
"I loved Season 7, Part One.  The Ponds are at their best.  I thought it was the perfect ending (or should I say beginning) of the Girl Who Waited and The Last Centurion.  I love how over the seasons the Ponds have matured and grown into adults, and the struggles they face with real life and doctor life.  I thought the Ponds Farewell was perfect and heartbreaking all at the same time, and really loved the touching scenes between Amy and her Melody.",Positive
"I can tell this series is well made, because I've grown to care about the characters, and I'm interested to see what is going to happen to them next. This show still hits on all cylinders, and one of the few comedies that actually can make me laugh out loud, not once, but several times during each episode. It's nice to see a comedy doing so well that appeals to the higher side of human nature, rather than most of the garbage that is on the tube these days.Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur....",Positive
We live in an apartment complex in the Bronx and I think this is the first kids show I have seen where the characters live in an apartment.  Besides liking the setting my 7 year old son liked the characters and the music.  He also liked that they solve a mystery.  He said he would watch another episode if it was available.,Negative
"I was not sure I was going to stick with it initially, but once the 2 dimension part came into play it was gripping. The first part seemed like a bunch of disconnected plots that the Fringe team had to solve. Over time, it became apparent that these were linked and it comes together several episodes into the story so don' give up if you are a SciFi junkie.The characters are interesting and compelling although the Doc can do some pretty good mental loop-d-loops on a frequent basis.I like the contrasting character and character interactions between the same people across the 2 dimensions.",Positive
Colbert is always  Entertaining. He keeps us informed on the most important matters. And always with a lot of wit.,Positive
"This season was not bad, but it wasn't my favorite either. I will say despite the series coming to the end 'Leverage' writers left us with super closure. They neatly and heartfully tied it up. The best way to describe the difference would be that season 5 just changed paced.",Negative
No matter what season I'm watching I just can't get enough and that is especially true for season 4. I love it!,Positive
"Make-up is great on the aliens, interesting human/non-human drama, a bit heavy on the suppressive environment and threats to survival...not a feel good kind of show...always ends with a cliff hanger and sort of makes me want to know what happens next.",Positive
These are great.  We have now watched seasons 1 through 10 and are now anxiously awaiting the 11th  season. We love NCIS.,Positive
"This is a tough story to get on screen, with so much of the action having taken place with mouse clicks and keyboard clacks.  It's a good start.Gibney the documentarian perhaps only scratches the surface of ethical considerations and real-life consequences of the leaks on view; but better he scratch the surface than glide over it as does Andy Greenberg's bookThis Machine Kills Secrets: How WikiLeakers, Cypherpunks, and Hacktivists Aim to Free the World's Information(2012).",Positive
"Exciting but short of riveting. Possibly because plot is very complicated. Treachery at so many levels requires near superhuman organization which conspiracy wonks are so quick to embrace. If you buy into the possibilities this is a very entertaining series. Acting is superb. If we think the ending leaves us with many questions about the future-- I embrace a quote from a famous philosopher. &#34;Oh, how our problems are soooo complicated. But the answer is so simple&#34; -- dr Seuss.",Positive
So far this is really good and I am enjoying it immensely.  A man has a computer chip in his brain which makes him able to do things that are far from ordinary.,Positive
"Didn't think I would enjoy it but gave it a shot.  The image for the show on Amazon and even the beginning of the pilot make it appear it will be primarily about the maestro.  He seems a bit shallow and uninteresting, but could be a decent side character, which is what it ends up appearing to be.  I really found myself caring about the main character and it was well acted and interesting.  I would definitely keep watching even though it isn't a genre I would normally be drawn to.",Positive
"When was the last time this show was scary?  The biters have become mere pests. They are no longer a real threat. Little Carl is much more frightening.  By Episode 13 of Season 3, dealing with the Zs has deteriorated into a game. When the zombies are treated like gnats, it's time to play the theme from ""Jaws.""  Dudes, the shark has been jumped.And what's with all this yakking. Is this The Talking Dead?  Episode 13 seems to be where things are bottoming out. Not one real fright in the hour. Rick and the Governor, still battling it out for Who is Nuttier, are at a sitdown at the behest of Andrea, a woman who can't see the forest or the trees. Her boyfriend keeps his zombie daughter in the breakfront, has a collection of living zombie heads in the parlor, stages gladiator fights with zombies, and she doesn't get it that he's a little, you know, odd?Anyway, the episode starts out reasonably well: Old Herschel is along as Rick's protection because when the going gets tough, there isnothing like an elderly one-legged man to provide back up, right?  But intriguingly, he has a gun and a knife strapped to his stump. Points for originality. And the Guv has a gun hidden under the sit-down table.  Okay, looks like we are going to have some action...the conflict will be resolved and one of the boys won't be going home. Yeah...dream on.  Rick and the Governor stare at one another meaningfully.  For minutes on end. And they talk. And they talk and they talk. Come on...we are not watching this show for the dramatic insights into their characters, we know the governor is insane and is determined to wipe out Rick's people, so why watch him pretend otherwise for most of the episode?  Enough dialogue...we want action, chills, terror. Otherwise we'd be watching some hip Indie film with Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. And when some Zs do show up, dispatching them is almost an afterthought.  Enter the shark.In addition to Rick and Guv's talk fest, other even more boring characters are highlighted.  Maggie and Glenn do their best to turn this into As The Zombie Turns as they examine where their relationship went wrong and then have a little gratuitous sex to keep those teenage boys tuning in.  Glenn is my least favorite character. He gets everything wrong and, when left in charge of the prison, decides to abandon his post and have a make out session with his galpal instead.  Ah, young love.  If a zombie singles him out, I will gladly provide condiments.Merle, the one-armed psychopath, is the only one who makes sense, wanting to take out the governor by sneaking up on him and whacking him. But the politcally correct Glenn won't stand for this. Another reason to dislike the little squirt.The show is becoming painful.  Let's have some more chills. I want the Walking Dead to scare me to death, not bore me to death. For a show that started out so well...the first episode was enough to induce nightmares, it's now a parody.  Please, please, scare the daylights out of us again. Make the biters scary again, not just little flies to annoy and be swatted away.  This may be the problem...the make up people have so many great ideas for creating rotted corpses, they have overdone it. Too many zombies and we get too used to them.  One zombie shuffling toward you in the dark, arms outstretched, coming at you slowly  but inexorably as you look around and see no way out...that's terrifying. But endless swarms of them shambling along and getting their poor little noggins busted over and over and over again?  Not so much.  Give us the Horror. Give us the Zombies...not the zzzzzzzzzzz.",Negative
"I was skeptical when I first heard about this series.  I am a fan of the original movies (even Manhunter) and didn't think this would be a very good interpretation.  Wow, was I wrong.  The cast is incredibly strong (Mads Mikkelsen is charming, sympathetic, and yet terrifying at the same time) and the atmosphere of this series is unnerving, but in a great way.  It doesn't flinch too much from the subject matter and it is far more graphic when it comes to the deaths, then I imagined it could be.It it well worth your time, especially if you are tired of the usual procedural television.",Positive
This was almost one of those series that would only make it if I were bored out of my skull. Very predictable.,Negative
"This pains me, since there is something within this film that is so amazing I feel it needs to be regarded as such, but three stars, while not awful, is certainly telling to the quality of this film as a whole.Does that make sense?First, the movie.  The film follows the true story (as much can be true in a film `inspired' by real events) of David Marks, a troubled young man looking for ways to rebel against a family that controls his every move (subconsciously, which is the best way).  When David meets and falls for Katie, it seems as though his life may start to iron out.  He walks away from his father `real estate' clutches and ventures off into a life all his own with Katie, but darkness erodes all happiness when David allows his father's manipulations to reel him back to New York, back into life in the Marks' family.  All tumbles downhill, rather rapidly, when familial tendencies begin to separate David and Katie until, one day, Katie disappears.For me, it is this point of the film where things start to just derail.  I understand the whole `inspired by real events' angle, and so I encourage even the bizarre, but the `made for TV' way in which the films later scenes are shot take away from the terror one should feel and actually gives this film a `Lifetime' movie feeling.The film does a 180, from decently engrossing thriller to complete disaster.So, this leaves one thing to be discussed...the very reason for which the films first half is so stellar; Kirsten Dunst.  I recently wrote an entry for my blog about the amazingness that was Kirsten Dunst in this film, and so I'm just going to quote that here (slightly doctored to reflect this review and not the article I initially wrote).""Then we have Kirsten Dunst, who just marvels with all sorts of layered emotional relevance in `All Good Things'.  Talk about a brilliant performance in a really bad film.  Kirsten plays Katie Marks, a real person (come on Oscar, why aren't you biting) who disappeared, `allegedly' at the hands of her deranged husband.  The one thing that Dunst's character, and performance, has (in spades) is serious emotional collapse.  One blogger mentioned that you could see Kirsten visibly age as she uncovers the truth about her husband.  I totally concur with this explanation of her devastatingly real performance.  As she slowly uncovers realities surrounding the family she's married into, you can see a hollowness erode her beautiful features.  She remains human despite the dramatic overtones (she never resorts to Hollywood's overtly obvious understanding of melodramatic `emoting') and delivers a quietly natural performance.  When she does unleash her suffering, it is with haunting desperation.  She completely collapses within her character's knowledge.  It's just a shame the film collapses the moment she leaves it.""Yeah, that pretty much sums it all up.  She acts circles around the rest of the cast, including Ryan Gosling, who suffers from poor character development (the script seems to skeletal when all is said and done) and really bad makeup.  I wish I could say skip the film, but you need to at least watch the films first half.  The moment Dunst leaves the scene though, you can take your exit as well.  The film just can't recover from such a tragic loss.",Negative
This season was unraveled and the actors seem to have lost interest. Kind of wish I hadn't spent the money.,Negative
This is probably one of the best shows I have every seen. By the second episode I was entranced!! The acting in wonderful the plot and background historically accurate!! It just goes to show you you can doa real period piece with real accuracy without being bored to tears!!! I love all the ax work! Vikings were badass to begin with but this show gives you a more complete look at the real life of a viking warrior and the culture!!!  It doesn't hurt that the talent can act and are burly awesome fighters to boot!!!!Thanks History Channel!! You rock!!!!,Positive

"Initially, you feel sort of guilty liking this guy but then you get over it quick when you see the scum he's trying to get rid of. While his methods are hardly by the book, he has much more of a conscience than the lead character in say, &#34;The Shield.&#34; It's also clever entertainment with the offbeat characters and relationships Luther develops. Hard to stop watching once you start.",Positive
"Love the story line and am sad to see it not on  the tv any more, but love the characters and it is a great series...",Positive

"After being blown away by the first few episodes in the 1st season, the show degrades into a soap opera between the characters, becoming obnoxious after a while -- a lot of negative sniping at each other.&#34;Gary&#34; the autistic savant is brilliant and the only character that makes the show worth watching at all.The plot ideas are pretty good but the writing or directing (can't tell which) drops the ball over and over again on what could have been a thrilling show and turns it into an emotion fest for the actors Too much emphasis on the characters' emotional conditions/relationships taking away from the exploitation of their fantastic abilities. It may be just the directing trying and failing to make something intense from weak writing. A characters' emotional break down is rarely as interesting as seeing them use their amazing talents.If you love watching characters with incredible abilities emote rather than seeing a story with them using their talents in unique situations, then you'll love this show.",Negative
"Like other bad habits, I watch this weekly and while it is not good for you, it is fun to watch.",Negative
"Season 2 is as good as season 1: a cop show with quirky characters (very much reminiscent of Elmore Leonard, whose stories inspired the series), a strikingly handsome and charismatic star, and violence that is sometimes seriously and other times humorously handled. If you like the show, you may find yourself looking up what US marshals do on Wikipedia--we did. So you enjoy yourself for 45 minutes or so AND you learn something.",Positive
"I really love this show.  It surprised me.  If a show makes me relate to or attach to its characters, then I know it is a good one.  This show did that for me.",Positive
"This show is amazing! The cast and plot is amazing. I watched some episodes of this show when it aired back in 2013. I have finally, a year later, watched all the episodes finished. It is such a great story line. Being American, I shouldn't like Elizabeth and her husband, but I am so fascinated with them. They are amazing.",Positive
"It's all play acting.  Which is fine, but just admit it.  They all have their button they can push, but they're never in any danger from bears, or exposure, or anything.  It does make you realize just how remarkable primitive people were, who survived such conditions without the special gear these people had.  It did have great scenery, but would have been much better if it spent time showing how things are done, instead of how someone is feeling.",Negative

"Based on its price and existing reviews, I decided to try ""White Collar,"" Season 1 and believe me, it was worth all 1,900+ pennies.  The story revolves around a classy master thief (played by Matt Bomer) who strikes a deal with the FBI agent (played by Tim McKay) who caught him twice, all in order to avoid going back to jail.  The agent works in the FBI's white-collar crime division in New York City and the master thief is there to provide a criminal's perspective to each case.  Catch is that the thief is confined to a two-mile radius by an ankle bracelet and needs to locate his missing girlfriend.  Tiffany Thiessen (of ""90210"" fame) stars as the agent's wife.  Great cast works well together.  Solid, believable scripts kept me interested and jonesing for season 2.  Could be filmed in L.A. for all I know, but looks like NYC to me.",Positive

I just think they could have had that character , go away and shut up, like they have almost had the chief do.  And Rusty, sure he is a kid, but  my goodness,  he is severely ungrateful. Maybe he would like option four,.... go back to the park and play the flute again.

"Whoever wrote this series did a splendid piece of work...We have watched each of the earlier shows several times. and each time have enjoyed it over again, and even noticed things that we had not observed before.  So it is with the later shows in the series.Actually, we would rate this 10 stars!!!",Positive
I am a fan of futuristic sci fi shows so I am inclined to like most shows of this type.  The twists and turns during this season kept me interested and surprised.  I didn't finish the season with any favorite characters but would return to watch the next season.,Positive
"Personally I hate it when people make grand sweeping statements. Rarely do I agree. However, in this case--I can say with certainty that of all of the movies I saw in 2012 (which was quite a lot), this was hands down the funniest. Every single character is perfection and the casting is brilliant yet mostly anti-type for most of the actors. Hugh Jackman is a blundering idiot. Jennifer Garner has a complex. Olivia Wilde is a money hungry stripper. Ty Burrell is hysterical, but actually his character is probably the most like the  ones he usually plays. The dialogue is usually just witty and subtle, yet I actually laughed out loud several times for some punch lines (getting me to laugh audibly while watching a movie usually never happens). I literally watched the entire movie with a happy smile on my face.Also, without getting into it--this movie has a real heart and warmth to it, aside from the comedy. The little girl with her adoptive parents is simply a beautiful story. And yet, it's not super melodramatic or even cheesy really. With so many over the top performances (Garner & Jackman especially), somehow the very real human sentiments come through and hit home. Garner is ridiculous, and yet isn't one dimensional. We actually feel kind of sorry and empathize a little bit with her at the end even though she's sort of awful.I've read a couple of reviews though that think this movie is mocking ""Middle America"" or even familial units. I don't see that at all. I'm from the deep south, and while we don't have butter competitions--we do have some other crazy things that people here take just as seriously. And that's not a bad thing. In my opinion, the movie might play the butter competition for laughs--and yet isn't saying that it's a stupid or evil thing either. It's possible to really enjoy these zany things, take them seriously--and yet find the humor in them as well. As far the family aspect, I think the movie tries and succeeds in contrasting a less than ideal family (Garners) with the adoptive parents family that really showcase the beauty of family.This is not a movie for everyone though. For instance, the ""Harriet Tubman"" line is only funny if you actually know who she is. There are several references like that in the movie. Not necessarily specific people, but (without sounding ridiculously pretentious)things and concepts that are generally a little more high-brow than a lot of whats out there in comedy land. This isn't slapstick comedy where people just fall down a lot and fart loudly or get super stoned and jump in pools. Basically, I think this movie is either going to really hit your funny bone--or you will think it's super boring. There's not a lot of in between. All I can suggest is that you give it a try.",Positive
"The Kilimanjaro episode is classic Pierce.  The premise for this episode was mostly new and well done. There were a few surprises, but they make sense when you look back and see how it all fit together.  I hope they do more episodes like this one. This would be an OK one to start with if you can't watch the episodes in order. I don't like to give spoilers, so just go watch it :P  Definitely worth a few bucks!",Positive
"James Spader has finally found his stride. This show is phenomenal and Spader makes it so addicting to watch. There are so many unexpected turns in the show that you never see coming which keeps your attention. Don't miss a second, because you will miss something important. The writing and acting are outstanding.",Positive
"Excellent documentary that makes a very impressive argument that we need to revoke the law pertaining to mandatory minimum prison sentences, particularly for non-violent crimes.This documentary helps prove what I have been saying about the prison industrial complex for decades: It's about money, not about people.The prison system in the United States is no longer about racism, but about classism.  Those on the top make tons of money off of the people on the lower end of the spectrum.  It's rather sickening.",Positive

"There once was a girl from New YorkWho had never been porkedShe worked at a jobSelling plastic knobsThen she lost it all to a dorkBilly Collins said we all have about 200 bad poems in us. Middle school and high school is a good time to get it out of our system. Amy (Emma Roberts) has about 20,000 bad poems in her and thinks she is good. She majored in poetry acquiring no jobs skills, setting back her parents $90,000. Depressed she moves out and gets a job at Adult World and hangs out with a crowd of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Local poet Rat Billings (John Cusack) is her idol and she forces herself, to his dismay, into his life.The film is another luke warm indie dying to be clever and finding an audience, which it has among would be poets. Amy's dreary life is symbolized by the dreary scenes of a depressed urban area in upstate New York. The actors saved a bad script. The use of a cross dressing gay (Armando Riesco) was funny in &#34;The World According to Garp,&#34; but now it just shows lack of writing skill and originality which is what I really want in an indie.",Negative
Amazing Show. They have tried to reproduce it but yet. The show has gotten better every season and for their final season this may be the best yet.,Positive
"I have never laughed so hard, felt so joyful, or marveled at such excellence, in a comedy before. The actors are comedic geniuses. Their timing is impeccable, their delivery perfect. You can't help but LOVE them. This is comedy at its finest. The writers are marvelously innovative and creative, and even the simplest slapstick comedic moments will become epic cultural phenomena. The only other show that even comes close to touching it is Seinfeld. Big Bang is just pure funny through and through, and endearing beyond belief. I live for this show. I own all the seasons and re-watch often. This show is hands-down the most hilarious comedy ever written. Long live The Big Bang Theory.",Positive
I have enjoyed each episode of this series and am expecting it to be cancelled because I enjoy it.  Not funny.,Positive
"All the parts were there for a truly fine series.  Good actors awesome budget...  well ok maybe not all the parts.  The story lines while interesting were executed poorly and the special effects just didn't do justice to the show.  What really stuck out to me as unacceptable were the fight scenes.  Jamie Sommers routinely injured people by accident when she forgot her new ""strength"".  In the fight scenes she couldn't fight here way out of a wet paper bag.  One super punch and the guy gets up not even a bruise, no broken bones nothing.  When she gets hit in her non bionic parts pretty much the same thing.  She can take a punch better than ALI ever could.They say the writers strike condemned this show to one season.  I really doubt that.  I would not purchase a second season.",Negative
I can't say that I am any good at writing reviews or anything of that matter but I really liked this movie.  Call me a nerd or a loser..whatever the name of the day is...I could actually relate to this young man and how he felt out of place...not now perhaps but there was a time.  A great story and a moral if you are really paying attention.,Positive
This show was such a cute surprise for me who is not a &#34;hunting for sport&#34; advocate.  This did give me insight into families that do such a thing along with their values and their points of view.  Love the characters & family dynamics.,Positive
"Most of the jokes are retreads from other sci-fi comedies and-or drug movies. the animation was fresh, though, but that was all because the writing needs re-tooling. Most of the writing was significant when it was in mel brooks', BLAZING SADDLES (ah, yeaah)!the two stars are for the animation because it reminds me of, SPEED RACER, and the claymation, such as, WALLACE AND GROMMIT, JASON AND THE AROGNAUTS and JASON AND THE GOLDEN FLEECE. i liked that stuff.",Negative
"The show is just plain old funny, and reminds me of how my family and I interact.  Everything is in good fun, there is a lot of honesty, when the jokes are coming, and it is not a show that I fear my children to watch.",Positive
"Two thousand years ago, northern Britain's native people, the Picts, rallied against the Romans.  In the northernmost outpost, a small garrison was massacred, except for second-in-command Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender).  He is rescued by the Roman's Ninth Legion, commanded by popular General Virilus.And then the Picts take on the Ninth Legion.So this is a sword. spear, and archery intensive, blood spattering (as in the300), chase, get caught, and escape type movie.The Romans, supposedly one of the most sophisticated and well-trained armies of the world, don't fare very well.  And why does escape seem to involve tramping over snow-covered mountain ridges, sensuThe Lord of the Rings?  Aren't there better ways to escape detection and get from point A to point B?There were just enough problems like this that made the plot irritating.  Be warned.",Negative
"This has some potential with some more development. I would probably watch more, if just to see how it comes along.",Positive
"I love this entire series and was seriously dejected when it left Netflix. Overjoyed to rediscover it. Weird habit -- I watch this before bed, and turn the sound completely off. Like closed captions for my bedtime videos, and it doesn't have them. Hence it loses one star for  Amazon's oversight.",Positive
The effects when they occur are spooky. The story and the acting are only mediocre. Good for a late night scare.,Positive
My girlfriend and I really enjoyed watching this pilot and we would definitely watch every episode if it were greenlit. The main actress is great! My biggest criticism is the way that weird demon thing looked at the end. It looked kinda cheesy like it was rushed or a beta version of what they wanted it to look like.,Positive
"Detectives with angst seem to work better in cold climates. Really handsome (coy) detectives probably should not take themselves too seriously. I like Rufus Sewell, but the broody, steamy thing just didn't work for me in these episodes. I think a lighter touch might have been better.",Negative
I really like the story on this one and was sad to see this 1st season end.  All but the last episode was free.  Kind of a bummer that now I am hooked and will probably have to pay $1.99 per episode to see the continuing season and hopefully there is one.,Positive
"Yes, 9/11 was horrific and for those of us who were not there I'm sure we can't imagine. I began watching this on 9/11/13 just to remember what had happened, part of the way thru I had to turn it off because the descriptions and so forth were so terribly graphic that it was disturbing. Don't watch this movie if you are sensitive to very graphic descriptions of the horrors of that day.",Negative
"Again, as indicated in my comments for Justified Series 2 and 3, I love this series.  Based on Elmore Leonard's short story &#34;Fire in the Hole,&#34; and Elmore Leonard, who passed away recently at the age of 88, is (because his writings will live on) one of my favorite writers.  His genre is one that maybe some of my friends would wonder why I like him and I don't know except to say his writing keeps you interested.  The Justified series, in my opinion, follows very closely to the way he wrote.  I recommend, as long as you don't mind the kind of violence involved in bad guys/girls against bad buys/girls and them against the law.  But start with Season 1 to be able to follow the characters right through.",Positive
"This new DVD - from the independent VSC imprint is a highly entertaining  look at all those voices behind TV cartoon characters like the Simpsons, Spongebob Squarepants and the new Batman cartoon series. Having grown up on 1950s and early 1960s TV cartoons - and not being a cable TV subscriber - many of the folks interviewed here (and the characters who voices they provide) were unknown to me. But, for anyone under 35 years old, these folks must be icons. And many of them are in their 20s or 30s as well).The 95-minute film that forms the basis for this DVD was Executive Produced and co-written by voice actor John DiMaggio - who gets a lot of screen time. He is a major voice on the series ""Futurama"" (which I've never watched). He got a lot of his fellow ""voice actors"" to be interviewed and you can tel, that they are talented because nearly all are shown with their collection of Emmy Awards surrounding them. And, in a few cases you see the character dolls that are marketed to the fan-base of their characters. I was glad to see that some of the ""pioneers"" of the industry going back to the 1950s toons that I watched as a kid (Stan Freberg - though his ""Beany and Cecil"" work is never mentioned - and Janet Waldo - the voice of Judy Jetson but also the original radio voice of Corliss Archer and a lovely lady I had the chance to meet in person a few years ago) were included, though all too brief.  One thing that all the interviewees say that they work short hours - 4 hour max per the union and get paid ""big bucks"". They do offer some advice in how to get into the business. And there is a whole section on the actors who provide voices for video games (a genre that I have to admit I'm not into and, therefore, can't comment on)The DVD contains bonus features including three ""Deleted Scenes"" (though they only total less than three minutes!) and a full length commentary by DiMaggio, another producer and the director. (I haven't listened to that. The other bonus is a panel  discussion at ComicCon in 2013 featuring many of the ""younger"" participants in the film (no Freberg or Waldo or Hank Azaria from the Simpsons). It runs about 50 minutes and is entertaining - except when the camera gets jumpy.So, I can highly recommend this to anyone who loves all the newer cable network cartoons and video games.  But - for someone like me - who remembers the classic Hanna Barbera cartoons of the 1960s, it was a bit of overkill. But I'm still giving it five stars cause there is an audience out there that this is targeted at and they will most certainly want to see the film and hear the stories on the bonuses.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",Positive
"Starts out a little corny but the show developes and grows and ultimately becomes more fun, has more of a horror show element and the characters grow on you too. I highly recommend the show just for a fun time.",Positive
"Great cast, great dialog, genuinely funny. It's nice to see a sitcom that has good writing for a change, even if it is animated",Positive
"Man, this was a great story!  Great acting!  Great everything.  I have a newfound respect for Jessica Lange.  She did an awesome acting job in this.  We were stunned how excellent this show was.  Highly recommend it.",Positive
"I'll tell you, I sure wouldn't want the main character in this show to interview ME. He'd see every little quirk and foible and end up reading me like a book. That, of course, is why he makes such a great &#34;detective.&#34;  Almost nobody can get past him. Tim Roth is brilliant and so are the scripts. Too bad it lasted only 3 seasons. But that's like 50 episodes of terrific mystery-suspense. If you haven't checked it out, get on the ball and do so.",Positive
"Very interesting that they are making this series.  And the first three episodes seem to me that they are doing a good job of the subject, about children who seem to show signs that they remember things about a past life.  It makes sense to me that on an organic planet, where everything is recycled, that spirits could be too.  But what never makes sense to me is that so many folks ""reincarnate"" from known figures, e.g. designer of the Titanic, screenwriter of ""Gone with the Wind,"" etc.  A teeny tiny fraction of one percent of humans are known to very many of the rest of us, so it makes more sense that the vast majority of reincarnation memories would be of a totally ordinary Johns or Janes.  But still, this show was interesting, if nothing else but a sociological study on many levels.",Positive
at first i really didnt like this show but now i cant wait to see what happens super excited :),Positive
"Season 3 of this once great show continues the decline.  And instead of one story arc, it contains two distinct stories.In ""Villains,"" there is a mass escape of villains from Level 5, a detention facility used by The Company to house evil people with superpowers.  Noah Bennett (Jack Coleman) gets to work trying to track them down.  He's surprised to see his new partner is Sylar (Zachary Quinto) who is trying to give up his murderous ways and get back on the straight and narrow.  Can they catch these bad men?  Will Sylar remain a hero?The second half of the season found our characters on the run.  ""Fugitives"" found now Senator Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar) heading a task force aimed at bringing all those with special powers in ""for their own protection.""  Of course, he's failed to mention his own unique powers.  Leading the charge against him is his own brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia).  Will Nathan see the error of his ways before everyone is captured or killed?The problem with this season lay in the story telling.  When the show was actually good (back in season 1), the episodes spent time with the characters, letting us get to know them so we cared about what they were doing or why.  That really drew me in.  Here, we are forced plot points with cardboard characters.  Heck, I had a hard time keeping track of who was doing what to whom it changed so often.  And I just don't care about the characters the way I used to because there is no depth to them.Then there's the case of Sylar.  Don't get me wrong, I think Zachary Quinto is a great actor.  But the way they keep including that character in events is forced and makes me wonder if we'll ever actually go somewhere with the story.Yes, I am still intrigued to see where they are going next to keep watching, but just barely.  They seriously need to make some tough decisions about how to best move the story forward and then stick to it, or they will continue to lose their audience.",Negative
"At first, I thought this show was just another sci-fi soap, but as the season went on, it has gradually gotten more interesting and I am starting to like it more. The season finale was actually quite good. So, we will see where it goes from here.",Positive
Good subject mater and presentation.  The show has always been a favorite of mine.  I can recommend it to everyone.,Positive
"""Captain American: Winter Soldier"" is an outstanding movie full of surprises, not least its willingness to wreak havoc with what we thought we knew about SHIELD. It's a thrill ride all the way to the credits (and make sure you stay all the way through).Post ""Avengers"", Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is working for SHIELD as a strike team leader, and trying to fit into a world he can't quite get used to. A hostage rescue mission in the Indian Ocean leaves some troubling questions in its wake. Rogers and fellow strike teamer Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are about to discover that everything they thought they knew about SHIELD might not be true...Captain American and the Black Widow will find themselves up against a frightening conspiracy, one that resurrects a few ghosts from Steve Rogers' past. Uncertain whom to trust, they recruit former paratrooper and VA counselor Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), while a couple of old friends will find them. The interaction between Rogers and Romanoff is fun, featuring two people with trust issues. Anthony Mackie is a good addition to the cast as the flying Falcon. Samuel L Jackson inhabits Nick Fury as if born to the role. Cobie Smulders is back as Agent Maria Hill, and Emily VanCamp has a short but promising turn as Agent Sharon Carter. Hayley Atwell has a nice cameo as Rogers' old flame Peggy Carter. Highly recommended to fans of the current crop of Marvel superhero movies.",Positive
"I like the characters in this program.  I just wish that  Augie  have an operation so that he could see normally again.  He is super sexy.  And I like the girl, Piper, as an investigator in the program  She looks better as a blonde.",Positive
Action packed great show. Hubby got me addicted. Love the ease of a season pass the show just shows up in my library. This show is intense gory and scary. Not family fair by any means. But once you start watching you really want to know what is next.,Positive
"While the TV version provides the facts, the indepth character analysis so common in King's books is missing.Enjoyable for easy summer fare.",Negative
This is one of the best cable drama shows today.  The acting is terrific and it recreates life in the early 80's very well!  Watched this season live but enjoyed catching up before the equally good 2nd season.,Positive
"What I like most about this show is the international setting: Paris, Amsterdam etc.  It doesn't hurt to have Donald Sutherland as one of the cast either.  The plot is fun:  several agents from different countries combine forces to solve international crimes.  In the pilot someone is killing young women and crosses international borders to do so.  As the countries haven't been working together to share information, the killer is getting away with it and appears he will continue his spree.  However, with the new elite international team formed, they hope to stop him in his tracks.  The diverse members of the team are multi-talented and have strong personalities.  Each has their own story.  Love the European setting and the strong cast.",Positive
"After seeing the trailer, I thought that this might be a somewhat dark and depressing film, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to teens and older audiences! Chris Colfer has a very promising career ahead, judging from ""Struck by Lightning."" And it's nice to see the class creeps get theirs in this flashback movie.",Positive
"It's not my favorite, but it's a good enough show to watch when nothing else is on. Some may have trouble following the dual storylines (one is the show and one is the &#34;show&#34;). I don't. But I know someone else who can't keep track.",Negative
"I found this hard to watch, but obviously I'm not the target audience.  Good morals and as the headline says, Congress should be forced to watch the pilot 100x until they understand the meaning of friendship and compromise... Especially those selfish %#*}% in the Tea Party.",Negative
"I am so sad that this series was cancelled...it could have gone on and on as far as I am concerned.  Very good story premise, wonderful scripts and the chemistry with all the actors was superb especially Crews and Reese!",Positive
"So disappointing....I assume A LOT OF Talented people were involved in creating this show.You are stuck....walk into a door....run until you drop....but, don't continue until youshow us more then 'bonking' and loose zippers.  What happen to the original idea?  You havelost the mojo.  Hopefully you can pull it together.",Negative
"Have watched this series numerous times. Need more bbc mystery videos available on prime, such as Hetty Wainthrop, Midsomer Murders and even Jeeves and Wooster.Oh and if anyone is interested in aristocratic life during Edwardian period, watch Manor House. Excellent!",Positive
I watched season 1 and 2 on netflix plus bought 3 on amazon started watching on friday all way till Sunday started back again over again with my son that's how good it is.,Positive
I really liked the angst of this follow up series and was glad they stuck to the continuity with the characters. I enjoy crime drama and this series delivered for me.,Positive
"This series bares all the hallmarks of good British dramas: interesting, well developed and rounded characters, complex relationships between various characters and plots that twist and turn and usually are not predicitable. The mid 50's costumes, props, settings and ambiance capture a sense of the era, as well as the real news footage and headlines of the day.",Positive
The Walking Dead is without a doubt one of the best action/horror/drama shows on television today.  It is the only tv show I know of that combines all of those genres with great story telling and compelling characters.  There is hardly ever a dull moment and I cannot wait to see each episode to come and hope this show lasts for many seasons!!,Positive
"Ugh, I can't take it - making the presidents right hand man involved in terrorism ?! The first lady clinically insane.  Then making you think it's the vice pres, then it turns out to be the president himself.  Uhhh, yeah, right. I thought at first at least they didn't do another mole in CTU (which they had done every single stinkin season).......then, turns out they did have someone in there following the 'right hand mans' orders! But he 'thought' he was doing the right thing.  Either way, STOP RECYCLING THE EXACT SAME PLOT LINES.  And they still have everyone respond to anything with ""I understand"".  Choose a different line once in awhile !  I give this 1 star, no idea why this has an average of 4 1/2 stars.  This is by far the worst of the first 5 seasons I've watched. It's more boring daytime soap opera than action/drama like the seasons before this one.  Feel free to skip this season, I wish I had.",Negative
I really enjoy all of the subplots probably better than the larger story arc.  The characters are well developed and carry the story forward very well.,Positive
"One of the best new shows - maybe THE best - of the season.  James Spader owns this role!  At the end of each episode, we are wide-eyed and awaiting the next episode with bated breath.",Positive
Colin Farrell was incredible. I love this film. It was a great whimsical film. Kept you engaged. Would recommend to a friend.,Positive
"In Short: &#34;Yankee&#34; defense attorney Jamie Sawyer takes on clients south of the Mason Dixon against ADA Roy Rayder. From the get go Jamie ends up in the middle of a police department sex sandal and conspiracy. Dating a homicide detective and feuding with a charming ADA, she relentlessly researches her cases and learns a little bit about southern charm.So far &#34;Reckless&#34; is great. There is just enough drama, romance and action to keep me interested. Banter between Jamie and Roy is fun to watch and the hunt for the bad guys is exciting. I have been a bit burnt out on this genre, but &#34;Reckless&#34; has shaken it up in a good way.",Positive
"I have enjoyed this series over the years; however, this year it seems to be falling into the pattern of other reality series.  It is becoming hard to believe that these people are friends any longer.  They are more like frienemies constantly trying to throw each other under the bus of infamy.  In the end making them all look tacky and bad considering that they are supposed to be such successful women.  Hope they change and go back to being more real with a little more class.  There are not that many african americans on television today and their behavior sometimes shows an image which persons who desire to keep us marginalized just love to use as an example why we should not be allowed to overcome.",Positive
"A few of the skits were concepts \I had seen before on other skit shows, but there's no denying these two's comedic chemistry",Positive
Excellent!!! Loved it! it covered the president whole life without dragging it out!! Great film clippage. Can't wait to watch all of them!,Positive
"So, here's an honest to goodness 3 star &#34;its OK&#34;, meaning its average. Nothing wrong with it, the technical aspects were fine. The story was very interesting to me. What kept it from being more than just OK was mainly my lack of involvement with the characters. They didn't grab me. At all. So, I wasn't invested.  Not sure if it was the acting or the writing of them. The best parts in the film were the flashbacks to the original composer and what went on with him. I would've preferred to see more of that, perhaps another movie.Overall, worth a watch but not during primetime viewing.",Negative
What can I say? If you like Ducky Dynasty seasons 1-3 you're probably going to like season 4 as well. More fun from the boys!,Positive
I just love the series. It's very interesting and gripping to see these detectives work cases. Great show to watch.,Positive
The writers plus the characters leave you with anticipation every episode. You wonder if &#34;A&#34; is still alive torturing the girls or is it CC leading them to think that &#34;A&#34; is alive putting up a smokescreen for her own diabolical schemes. Or is it someone you would not ever suspect?,Positive
"Like a train wreck or car accident, Under the Dome hooked me and then reeled me in. There were moments where I hated every character, well except maybe Linda the cop. The only way to watch this was on Amazon video - the commercials were just way too many and annoying to sit through an episode. About midway through the series, the writers moved the series in unpredictable directions. I know they had to make an incredible cliff hanger to entice people to watch season two, but it was almost too much over the top.Where the program really went wrong in a major way, was when the young Angie was imprisoned by Junior. That was beyond creepy, beyond what the writers should have ever done. I really hated those episodes. Some might consider the following a spoiler, so be forewarned. Now that part is finished, the series can move forward.I'll watch season two. This is a series I love to hate.",Negative
The only reason I don't give this five stars is because the series ended too soon and not at all the way I had hoped.  But every episode was a lesson in how a TV series should be done.  Great acting.,Positive
"Cute movie with a unique plot, but far too predictable and often times bland.  The little girl makes the movie, though Jennifer Garners acting is superb.  Not the best, but definitely not a bad movie.  It wasn't worth the Watch While It's In Theaters price though.  I would wait until it is cheaper.",Negative
I'm a great fan of Kevin Beacon therefore I really enjoyed the entire season. I hope there will more following/,Positive
"From the Title of this review, you know where I'm going to take this.  First of all, let me say I'm not a fan of the horror genre.  I  don't go to them at the movies.  I don't bother with them on TV.  In spite of all the blood and gore, I find them tedious, predictable, and boring.  But I gave this one a shot in a desperate attempt to find something watchable in what is mostly a sea of mediocre filler on Prime.  Frankly, I didn't think I'd make it to the second episode.  But here and there are some surprising gems on Prime, although often rare and difficult to find.This is an excellent series that stands with the best.  There's the expected, horror, blood, and hideous gore perpetrated by demented sadists in charge of the institution.  They are Hell bent on making the lives of the inmates horrible beyond mention.  Some inmates shouldn`t even be in an asylum.  In fact, the basic premise is a horror clich&eacute;, but it's written and executed with aplomb.  It defies the usual tedium of typical horror by being delightfully unpredictable, and interesting.  Yes, interesting.  If it were a book, I'd call it a page turner.There's humor too, usually dark and dry to be sure, but I found myself laughing at some very clever lines.  If you can believe this, Episode 10, even has a brief respite with a production number, featuring Jessica Lange, and the rest of the wretched inmates doing a bouncy song and dance production in the middle of all the asylum chaos.  I know how this sounds totally inappropriate, but it actually lends itself quite well and makes sense in its particular context.  I backed it up and watched it twice, and I still want to watch it again.This series is probably the biggest surprise I've had on Prime.  Lange, who I've not seen much of in recent years comes out of obscurity and gives a wonderful performance.  She's not on her own, either.  She's working with some other well known and capable talent working outside their usual roles, at least the roles I`ve seen them in.  The rest of the cast is excellent too.  Perhaps the director deserves some credit for this.  The cast seems to fit together unusually well.  It's worth a watch.  You might be surprised.",Positive
"""Breaking Bad: The Final Season"". . .Whew! We made it to the end... and what a grim ride it turned out to be.Hey - I have a question about the DVD set, which I bought ""new"" on Amazon. The discs I received have the same kind of blue-green appearance that DVD-Rs have, and the menu and features behaved a little wonky. For example, I could not get the English subtitles to play correctly, and I don't normally have that problem with other DVDs or Blu-Rays. Anyone else have these problems? Is this normal, or did I get sent a bootleg copy?",Positive
"I really enjoyed this series! Just enough personal interaction to make the show work. Even though one member of the cast changed, the show still went on with the usual great acting. I would recommend you watch it!",Positive
"I could watch this movie three more times and still not understand it, no, I don't think I could ever understand it.",Negative
"at this time i would like to say that i am crushing like crazy on Captain Jack Harkness. i have NOT yet seen Miracle Day (it is due out on dvd tomorrow--FINGERS CROSSED!!!), but i am truly sad that the TINY MINDS of the world might let Torchwood die, without closure. i PRAY (c'mon, pray with me.) that the 50th Anniversary Doctor Who season will include Jack--it really should.John Barrowman plays Jack, and is a really lovely person--i hope nothing but happiness, for him, and everyone he loves.",Positive

I didn't pay full price for this and I am glad I didn't.",Positive
"Sometimes this show seems a bit trite with the twenty-something actors trying to be teens and not pulling it off very well. That said, the twists and turns of the plot keep you coming back for more. All in all, I enjoy the show much more than I expected to going in.",Positive
Supernatural beings in a struggle to hang on to their humanity and live normal lives. Their struggles are anything but normal. Highly entertaining and often comical.,Positive

On February 16, 2012, Syfy announced that the show's fifth and final season would premiere on April 16, 2012. A case was made to Syfy that this would leave a lot of story lines open and would really not give the fans closure.

Hokey for the sake of hokiness. I will continue to watch because I suspect that somewhere in my psyche lurks a redneck.,Negative
"If you're wondering if you should &#34;Give it a go&#34; I definitely recommend that you do. I watched the whole season in a day and a half, it was great! I love the dark humor that the show delivers. Billy Bob Thornton is a very good, bad, bad man. I found myself laughing at his parts most of all.It was a great story that kept me engaged the whole time and kept me wanting to start the next episode right away. I'm always excited when I find a show like this, the only bad thing is when it's over. And 10 episodes goes by rather quickly but it is a great ride.On a plus note You do not need to be familiar with the movie to enjoy this. In fact, I wish I hadn't seen the movie before watching this. As I think the movie actors had a little bit better accents &#34;Yah know&#34;. Plus I was always mentally comparing scenes from the movie to the show. It was kind of distracting but not that bad.At the end of the day I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who likes dark comedy/drama's it's a win-win.Thanks for reading!PS You'd better call Saul :)",Positive
A wonderful series. Great acting and the plot lines are very interesting.Love to &#34;hate&#34; some of the leading  characters.,Positive

"People who complain about tired old cop show tropes have attention spans governed by Twitter feeds, the nature of the job and story telling in general is going to give rise to certain repeated tropes.  Its like saying &#34;Oxygen, its so predictably there when you have to breathe&#34;.  Where the art of a engaging tv series rises is with the characterizations and the acting skills of the actors, and yes plot twists that are make use of the character's.  There's some good potential here, I gave it 4 stars for that potential and the pilot did a good job of engaging my interest till the next showing.",Positive
"To review this one is difficult. The acting was fabulous but, but, it is so, so graphically violent. I love the main actor and he did a splendid job. I do wonder how good it is for those who are not mentally balanced to see things like this? I almost could not believe that I was watching it? It was pretty hard on the senses to think of such things as this. I also found it difficult to believe that the one character could not put the pieces together? I think that is a normal horror ploy? The guy who plays the main character is ever so handsome&#8230;..he was a dancer prior to acting and it shows in his movements. It does however, make him a bit more creepy to be so well composed and show no emotions for what he has done.If you watch this, I am unsure if it should be watched unless all your hinges are bolted down.",Negative
"I loved this series.  I would give it more stars if possible.  The actors are excellent.  The story--though grisly at times-was compelling.  While watching it, I felt I was watching a true life drama.  Warts and all.  This is not some glossy police drama.  I felt bereft when it was over.  This ranks right up there with Prime Suspect.  Why do we have to go to the British to get real life dramas?  I am tired of the US smart mouth series.  Everyone has to be good looking, and have all the answers in three minutes.  But I digress. Buy it!",Positive
This show continues to be one of the freshest shows ever--Gavin and Stacey are great--but Smithy and 'Nessa are priceless.,Positive

"As a fan of the original Bionic Woman, I am appalled by the liberties taken by the writers in this show. First of all, they have completely altered the story of Jamie Summers, the original Bionic Woman. The story presented in the series is COMPLETELY different. I don't undertand why they didn't just change her name.Second, the acting of Michelle Ryan is not the best. Still, I do think she is doing the best she can with what she has been given. But, she displays no emotion, barely any tears when crying. Her face looked completely emotionless when her fiance died or when she was at his funeral. The show just doesn't deal with her emotions. They have concentrated so much in the action and the lines that they have forgotten an important part of television, facial expressions and body language. The younger sister seems to be the only one displaying an emotional range in the show.The show is not that cohesive. They do not explain certain things. Why was the sister sentenced(?) or prohibited from using computers? The show just doesn't tie in things together.The show has a very nice visual style (hence my rating of 3 stars) and I think it has some potential, but a lot of things have to be fixed. These facilities, very low budget by the way, where she trains have really bad security and look like a basement. They should vamp up these settings and make them more hi-tech. The plotlines and the writing should deal more with how Jamie feels about all of this. She took everything so matter of fact (except for the initial screaming after her operation). Someone needs to wake her up and say ""Woman, you are Bionic! React! I would also like to know how she knows all these fighting techniques. Was some computer implanted into her head? I mean, she did not train for that long!In conclusion, the show has a lot of things that need fixing. And the first thing should be for Michelle Ryan to start showing some emotion and act better.",Negative
"A brilliant rendition on the Stargate theme, Universe,-Not unlike Terminator: The Sarah Chronicles-burned with an emotional flame thats just out ofspectrum with the folks mainlining their T.V.People seem to have difficulty when conflict andprogression are described in more than 10 emotional states.I'm going to leave he last episode unwatched andadd the suggestion as I did with the Terminatorfranchise- Not that much time has passed and theactors can still pick up without a hitch.

"Toni Collette (an Australian actress) does an amazing and convincing job of portraying multiple personalities ""alters"" in this dark comedy.  Toni ""Tara, Buck, Alice, & 'T'"" work alongside John Corbett fromMy Big Fat Greek Weddingas they navigate life and it's stressors.  The acting is superb and the direction and production keep the viewer coming back episode after episode.  This series is unique in that MPD or Dissociative identity disorder (DID) has never been approached before on television besides the old movie Sybil.  United States of Tara gives a much more realistic view of how a typical family might deal with this.It's dark, it's funny and I found myself watching episode after episode in almost one sitting.  Collette's portrayals are convincing and really debut her acting prowess.  For something different and oddly funny, try out this series.  With Steven Spielberg at the helm, the series really comes together.",Positive
I started watching last season and jumped right in and understood what was going on. I'd suggested this to anyone.,Positive
"To put it shortly Season 1 was great. The story was fresh, the dynamics between the characters were interesting, the photography was gorgeous and to back it all up with had this tale and storyline of a woman attempting revenge on her father's ex employee who framed him for a crime he didn't commit. Splendid! You could almost feel the essence of the story it did seem like a classic tale however this series unfortunately has extended itself too long and over welcomed it's stay.What was once a thrilling story of seeking justice, double crossing, plotting and betrayal is now nothing but an over exaggerated, melodramatic and annoying scene after scene of muffled twists and turns. Too many things are thrown at us it's hard to keep track of what exactly is going on. Too much of something is really not that good and sometimes simplicity is key!It's one thing to create a masterful logic complicated plot, to keep things interesting however it's a completely another matter to hoard this plot to death! The purpose of Emily's ever existence in the lives of the Graysons was to seek revenge and that idea although persistent and toyed with is no longer the spotlight of the series I'm afraid.A plot about revenge is never intended to take this long, this story would've made much more sense and would've been fantastic if it was introduced as a mini series of 10 episodes per season instead of a full on show. Much less complications and far more superior writing. If we were to crop out all the unnecessary details and uncalled for twists and turns we would've ended summing up the whole 3 seasons to a 2 hour movie. That's just how much contrived scenarios are being shoved down our throat. Of course the viewer can't help but watch out of curiosity for what's going to happen next and how this whole endeavour is going to finally end, but that doesn't make the journey pleasing in fact it's very painful to watch.And don't even get me started on the latest twist from the latest episode, after making us set through three seasons the writers want to punish us by telling us that the cause of the series was a false one to begin with! It's almost like they just made that up last minute to get people to watch the following season because they know that everyone is getting bored with this show. I hate how the characters end up getting ADD or going through constant Bipolar sessions. It's almost like no one is ever certain of who they are and yes it is confusing and stolen from a million dozen storylines made before hand! The writing is just lazy.If you're going to ever watch this show then don't watch it pass the first season and second season. The third season is just a claustrophobic disaster.",Negative
"I have learned a lot about the world,from watching episodes of this show.being a traveling Nurse,I have been to many foreign countries,but never got more really than the tourist view ,of them.Thanks for this show.But one wonders,is Anthony Bourdain an alcoholic,?

"- Clara: ""Doctor, what are you going to do?""- The Doctor: ""I don't know. Talk very fast, hope something good happens, take the credit.""Peace out, the fez and bow tie, the fish fingers and custard, the lanky herky jerky. As someone with ADHD once said, ""All good things must yadda yadda yadda."" I think we perhaps set the bar too high not only for the 50th Anniversary special but also for this, Matt Smith's final bow. The Time of the Doctor delivers enough fanboy joy that some time went by after the watching of it before I began fixating on the troublesome bits.***Just maybe a few SPOILERS now***I didn't mind that it was a scattershot episode; it seems apropos of the manic way the Eleventh Doctor conducted his business. I don't know that it's apropos that these first impressions of mine - as I'd finished watching the Christmas special only moments ago - come off just as scattershot. Excuse the whiplash. The Time of the Doctor has got this epic flavor, never mind that it only has a running time of around 70 minutes. Some things are beautifully in the pocket, some things made my brain hurt. Matt Smith is brilliant and emotive. I appreciated the bigness of the story, the space opera elements of it. Moffat once again tweaks the narrative to fit the gothic fairy tale. The story spans the breadth of centuries while at the same time, if I figured it right, spanning the breadth of one Christmas (in objective time). There's a 300-year-old Christmas turkey. The basic bones of the plot has to do with a remote town called Christmas what's been laid under siege by the entirety of the Doctor's rogues' gallery. My deja-vu was getting deja-vu as this episode regurgitates scenes of the Doctor's most relentless enemies converging in space (""The Pandorica Opens"").But I also loved the smaller moments, the Doctor's exchanges with Clara and with ""Handles"" the startlingly evocative Cyberman head. The regeneration sequence develops with strong, emotional flourish. As the Doctor carries on in that town called Christmas and as we mark the long passages of time elapsed, Matt Smith tones it down and tones it down and tones it down, and it's highly effective and so melancholy. I am trying so hard not to spoiler things. I suspect I'd already given some things away.Some more parting ramblings (and, seriously, SPOILER alert!):- Matt Smith in 63% convincing old man make-up- For the ladies, nekkid Matt Smith with the salacious bits strategically covered up- Dang, gonna have to reorganize my Doctor Who shelf exhibit- Is it me or does Moffat nowadays portray every Sontaran as stupid?- Handles > Wilson- I was annoying everyone in the room by asking why the Doctor is now suddenly aging? But then it struck me that, as the Doctor explained, since he'd already used up his final regeneration, his body was finally breaking down (but then how to explain the War Doctor's aging?)- I still love Clara to bits - and Jenna-Louise Coleman keeps on being spectacular - but it may be that she's lost a bit of shine now that she's no longer the Impossible Girl- What's really up with the crack? It's Time Lords behind it now, eh? What about the Prisoner Zero arc or being erased from existence?- The prophecy about how the Silence will fall delivers a weak pay-off- There was so much insane stuff going on I wish they'd stretched this out to several episodes- My lukewarm reaction to the Papal Mainframe: I perked up when the Doctor informed Clara of the expected dress code when in the presence of the Mother Superious Tash Lem. But it's all a tease, even if Mother Superious Tasha Lem is most fine- In the Matt Smith era there had been better Doctor Who Christmas Specials (A Christmas Carol, The Snowmen)- Peter Capaldi: very, very promising",Positive

"I love sci-fi and really liked the X-files. It seemed the characters were fighting a bad script on this one .  So many plot holes and logical inconsistency.  Actually kind of frustrating to watch. It was like the old Three's Company episodes where everything could have been cleared up in the first scene if someone had just told the whole truth. I tend to like sci-fi movies and shows BECAUSE the protagonist is the smartest person in the room.  They would do what you would want them to do, because it makes sense.  So many things happened in this show that didn't make sense.  Not in a mysterious ""LOST: what is the black smoke?"" kind of way, but in a frustrating people acting completely stupid kind of way.Hopefully the pilot was just trying to jump start some good writers and character development.",Negative
"For those of us who unfortunately have not seen the original BANLIEUE 13 - aka DISTRICT 13 - (made in 2004 with the same crew except for the director - Pierre Morel), some of the background information that usually follows in a sequel is missing and according to many, the sequel here BANLIEUE 13:ULTIMATUM - aka DISTRICT 13: ULTIMATUM is not as strong a film.  And perhaps that allows the viewer to appreciate fine French film making without the comparison!Luc Besson (of the Trasnporter series et al) wrote this script (or rather, this plan of choreography, as there is not a lot of spoken dialogue in this fast-paced thriller) and Patrick Allessandrin directs a story of a region of Paris (District 13) that is cordoned off the rest of Paris by a group of five warlords who manage to control the drug ridden violent region.  Basically the tale is that of two men - Captain Damien Tomaso (Cyril Raffaelli) and undercover cop of the 'good' police and Leto (David Belle), an ex-thug who in the previous film infiltrated a gang in order to defuse a neutron bomb.  That was supposedly in 2010.  The film opens some years later when District 13 is now in control of power over the government and the 'bad police' are attempting to destroy the area and rebuild according to their greedy plans.  The action is the story and the action is immensely exciting!  David Belle invented a discipline known as Parkour, which consists of moving quickly and efficiently in any environment, using only the abilities of the human body, and though his acting credits are minimal, he is stupefying in his live action role. Belle and Raffaelli are the reasons to watch this thriller as their screen chemistry is magnetic.  Other standout performances in the film include the much tattooed Elodie Yung as Tao (the principal gang queen), Philippe Torreton as the much oppressed President, and the evil appearing Daniel Duval as the nemesis who turns the keys of the plot.The cinematography is superb, the musical score is French rap music that while it suits the mood of the film becomes irritating in its repetitiveness.  In all this is an escape film that is high on excitement is not very high on intelligent dialogue.  But put Bell and Raffaelli together and the combustion is authentically credible.

"OK, the first thing you need to know about Lillyhammer is that it was produced for Norwegian NetworkTV.....not an American audience (although it translates well). Ignore the silly comments about &#34;nosubtitles&#34;....they are right here on the stream just like they are right there on Netflix if you have thatservice, as they are on the DVD.The story is very simple, Frankie the Fixer rolls over on his mob boss, is offered his choice of placesto relocate and fixes on Lillehammer (because he saw it on the Olympics and thought it was cool). Oncehe arrives, he soon finds out things are done differently in Norway, and the show is basically about howFrankie (now Giovanni/Johnny) figures out his own solutions to the daily obstacles of life in Norway thatare constantly being tossed in his way. For example, he finds from the local constable that his driverslicense is invalid and left to walk back to town only to be told by the local DMV that it takes 6 months toget a license in Norway. But as usual, a solution presents itself to the ever vigilant and opportunisticGiovanni!If you've seen the Sopranos, then you've seen the character being portrayed here by Steve Van Zandt,probably with a little more charm and a little less &#34;stugatz&#34; than on Sopranos. But thats where anycomparison ends. This show is funny, there is intrigue, romance, adventure, JR Ewing style wheelingand dealing, and a rare and accessible view into a culture that is in many ways similar to ours, but aworld apart in reality. 4.5 StarsBTW, Netflix just announced the show has been picked up for Season 3, a testament to the popularityof this terrific series! (8 episodes per season)",Positive
"I have really enjoyed this series.  I am at the end of series 4 and have one left.  It has great acting, lots of action and maybe a little over the top plot but that to me is what makes it enjoyable to watch.  I am not much of a reality show watcher.  Don't care for shows that are too true to life, got enough drama in my own life, so fiction works better for me.  I am just sad there is only 5 series.  Love Amazon and neflix to be able to start from the begining and watch when I want.",Positive
Cal Lightman is an enigma sometimes you love him sometimes you hate him but the character is certainly unique and the way he and Jillian interact is great.  Went thru all 3 seasons in a week and wish there were more.,Positive
"Midsomer Murders was rather refreshing after watching police procedurals such as Wire In The Blood: Completely Wired - Series 1-6 Collection [NON-U.S.A. FORMAT: PAL Region 2 U.K. Import] and Touching Evil: Complete Collection. The two latter shows are great crime dramas, but much more gritty and gruesome than Midsomer Murders.Amazon Prime members are able to view Midsomer Murders' episodes via instant download for free and I must say the stories are engaging and interesting. Set in the bucolic English villages in Midsomer County, the murders that occur here(at an alarmingly high rate, one might add) are in stark contrast to the serene beauty of the English countryside.DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) resides with his wife Joyce (Jane Wymark) in the country town of Causton, where the Criminal Investigation Department is located. Tom is a meticulous investigator and an astute observer of human nature. His methodical investigative methods and keen eye contrast with his young DS Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) who is not very PC and often blunders to the wrong conclusion regarding the identity of a particular murderer.There is a Gothic feel to many of the crimes, which is enhanced by the unique music chosen to accompany a particular episode. At times, certain scenes seem overly exaggerated, but to me, they only add to the charm of the show. This is a great example of atmospheric crime dramas with a wonderful ensemble cast and riveting storylines. Midsomer Murders will appeal to fans of British cozy mysteries, where blood and gore take a backseat to wit and humor, and the focus is on investigations set amidst a bucolic, close-knit setting.",Positive
"I hate that I liked this, because there is not a single character with any spiritual content, values, or concerns.",Positive
I'm enjoying watching a few episodes every few days. I missed a lot of this series when it was on. I think it's a great show showing that police officers are people too and have feelings and emotions like any other human being.,Positive
What more really needs to be said? You either love the series or hate it. I think these specials give Matt Smith an opportunity to show some emotion they've all but been forbidding him to portray as the Doctor so far. I *know* the actor can do it (seen him outside Dr. Who)...so I wish the writers/directors would allow him.,Positive

"You know, I don't normally put my review titles in all caps. But what can I say? This show is... well, BRILLIANT! I've always thought that there are far, far too many five star reviews here on amazon. But if there ever was a show that genuinely deserved a rave, this is it.Archer is a wonderfully absurdist frolic for strictly adult audiences. Fundamentally this show is a giant spoof of 1960s spy thrillers; a spoof made for decidedly 21st century sensibilities. It's the show Get Smart would have been had all the characters been perpetually high on crystal meth.In fact, the characters on Archer are all selfish, petty, and utterly and completely venal: the three great ingredients from which comedy is made. They seem to think and act more like deranged adolescents than grown-ups. Deranged adolescents with access to firearms. Add all this together and you get some idea of the flavor of the show. Archer is very much in the spirit of the original Williams Street adult swim cartoons, but is never merely derivative of them. Which of course is exactly what you'd expect, given that this show is produced by Adam Reed, whose previous producing and directing credits include both Sealab 2021 and Frisky Dingo. Indeed, Reed's voice credits go all the way back to the original Space Ghost Coast to Coast.But while a similar sense of humor can be found throughout, Archer definitely has a flair all of its own. Visually it has kind of a pseudo-realist ""ligne claire"" (clear line) style that matches perfectly with the creatively anachronistic world the characters inhabit. Cell phones and other contemporary technologies may abound, but jet-age fashions still prevail, and the KGB and the Soviet Union remain major adversaries.But the first thing long time hard core animation fans will notice is that voice of H. Jon Benjamin brings its own uniquely laconic comic genius to the title role of ""Archer"" himself. Many of us remember Benjamin best as Coach from Home Movies. Others may recognize his voice from various bit parts in Family Guy and the Venture Bros.. But wherever you know him from, I for one am overjoyed that a suitable vehicle has finally been found for this great talent.Better yet, Benjamin is complemented by scarcely lesser talents such as Aisha Tyler, a standup comedian who plays Lana Kane, another top operative at the same spy agency; and Jessica Walter, who plays the head of the agency - who also just happens to be Archer's mother. However, I should stress that this rather unusual combination of relationships is never reduced to mere sit-com hijinx. Archer is the kind of show were things get genuinely disturbing. In fact, this is one of those rare shows where the entire cast is incredibly strong - and backed up by an equally strong writing team, too.What more can I say? See it!Theo.",Positive
Great character development and great show.  I just wish the main character would actually show some strength (aka &#34;balls&#34;) going forward.,Positive
"The final season of Friends did a good job of closing out the series on some satisfying notes but it simply wasn't one of the best seasons.  While Monica & Chandler having babies was nice and giving Phoebe more play early on the season as she marries the laconic Mike were nice touches the misses were felt such as having Chandler become so dispassionate toward so many situations (other than the baby) to the point that his character was moving toward being unlikable and having Rachel stay behind for Ross (why!?!?!?) didn't allow for a settled closure to their relationship and maddens me!Still, a series that was brightly colored and deftly dipped into deep emotional territories without becoming heavy-handed or maudlin.  A successful bow in the end overall.And now the 10 year reunion is right around the corner...",Positive

"After not watching a rotation of Survivor since the All-Stars edition of 2004, I had some free time on my hands this fall and decided to jump back in.  After the initial excitement of watching the show again faded, I was quickly reminded of why I dropped out in the first place...until the final few episodes, when the drama kicks up to classic levels.The &#34;gimmick&#34; of this season revolves around loved ones.  One returning player this time brings along a loved one to play with/against depending on the tribal alignments.  Redemption Island is also brought back for this season, as is the hidden immunity idol.The trouble overall with this season is that its first half is quite bad.  It is all tears and whining.  The loved ones angle is (IMHO) a step back for this series, as it just leads to more contrived drama (something this show now produces enough of on its own).  I felt as if the &#34;what will my loved one think&#34; angle was beat over our heads time and time again.I also didn't like Redemption Island (this was the first season I've watched that featured its &#34;second chance&#34;).  The concept is novel, to be sure, but I liked the sheer drama of &#34;the tribe has spoken&#34; at each tribal council, with the voted-out party not being able to return.I really began enjoying this 27th season in the final four or so episodes, when all the chaff was cut away and it turned into the Survivor I remembered from years ago.  Thus, it turned into at least an &#34;okay&#34; season.  2.5 stars would have been my exact rating, but I'll bump it up to a three due to the final few hours of drama.Basically, I felt that there was just too doggone much going on in &#34;Blood vs Water&#34; and all the craziness overshadowed a show that even to this day can produce some real drama.  I hope that cycle #28 goes back to all (or mostly) new competitors and favors a more traditional show structure.  Go away from Redemption Island in favor of more inventive reward challenges, and just lighten things up again.  Survivor is always best when focusing on the human drama.  Why rely on gimmicks to overshadow it?",Negative
"I give Season 4 of ""24"" four stars not rated relative to it's own normal standards, but in comparison to everything else on TV.Simply stated....... even during a weak season like Season 6, ""24"" is still better than most other crap on TV these days.In other words, even at it's worse, ""24"" is better than most modern shows at their best.So many other shows on TV have become simple one trick pony and non-stop sex joke one liners that they have no substance except the cheap laugh.No wonder we now watch very few modern shows outside Court TV crime shows and exist primarily on DVD collections of past shows like........ Cheers, Wings, Silk Stalkings, Seinfeld, etc..etc..",Positive
"I watch because of Kevin Bacon. Kevin is not his usual excellence. Why? I suspect because of his inexperience in acting in TV series. I understand though. It take time to prepare and Kevin does not have time enough to get into the acting. And the character Clair has the good fortune to have kissed Kevin and Timothy of Justified. Three stars because I know it will be better Season Two. I hope then a believable plot will be offered.No, I will not pay for a Season Two, if there is one, which I say there will not be a Second season.Kevin Bacon: Kevin needed easy money. He signed a contract for easy money. Kevin walks a thin line here. If I did not know Kevin, I would never watch a movie with him as a primary player - based on his performance in this series. And the story.  Way too predictable, way too easy devices to creat fear, for instance, the buried alive female character.Value of each episode: $.75, yes, I mean to say 75 cents.I just watched Episode 15.  The Joe Carrol character's accent is silly. The missed sniper shot of  the Ryan character hit another officer. Too obviously illogical to the plot. And so unbelievable. The final scenes are a mish-mash of several films and TV shows childishly done. Every scene is easily predictable. This series is silly. I assure you that I will not waste my money on a second season. Watch Justified for excellent acting by all, the viewer cannot predict what will occur. Justified is an hour long show that goes by so quickly because of the suspense that I think that I just watched a 10 second show.",Negative
"This documentary about the home video/VCR boom leaves no stone unturned.  It's primarily gonna appeal to, not only people who lived through the era, but people who were really into movies, especially cult films.  A lot of screen time is dedicated to cult and horror films, and there are many interviews with people from that scene like Frank Hennenlotter and Lloyd Kaufman.  This makes sense considering it's the cult audience that still embraces the VHS format.  Your average Avengers fan is really less likely to care.It's a very thorough documentary, covering the birth of the format, the companies that utilized it, the modern day collectors and even a VHS merchant who still runs a shop.  Lots of ground is covered, and it's clear that this documentary was a labor of love.  For folks like me, it's a very welcome trip down memory lane.  In fact, kinda depressing in a way.  Very highly recommended though!",Positive
"First one or two episodes were sort of interesting, but then, the sillies set in. If paranoia is your thing, then you will love this. The usual liberal plot of big bad greedy guys who control world events to make themselves richer. Of course the biggest bad guy is X CIA, who else? The &#34;good guy&#34;, also X CIA, is gay (is that saying something about the writers?). The amount of surveillance portrayed would require an army of people to monitor and maintain all the bugs. Any intelligence agency would love to have the super small devices shown, that somehow seem to function without any visible power source.  All in all, very stupid. Hope I don't get a four leaf clover in the mail over this.",Negative
I loved the characters and the story. Excellent development so far i couldn't stop watching. I Will be waiting for the next episodes!,Positive
"As usual with great shows, they retooled in the second season ruined it and it got canceled. Before that it was so well written, acted and presented that it was entertaining on every level.",Positive
"First, let me mention that, Michael Scott aside, I was a fan of this show just as much for Jim and Pam, and if they end their relationship on a ""divorce"" note I will NEVER invest in another show by these producers. Guess what? Breaking up a happy family to go out on a high-minded story arc is a betrayal to the fans, and here's one more fundamental truth: DIVORCE ISN'T FUNNY!!! These characters deserve to end the show as much in love and together as when they started.I am a STALWART fan of the series, and have been since it's American debut. I think the humor of the show was that most of the other people in the show were REAL people and Michael was the insane one. That is what the show was about, how a crazy manager interacts with real people. Michael was shocking, irrepressible, irredeemable, and loud, inappropriate at the worst and most inopportune moments, and almost entirely oblivious to it (which was also his saving grace). The moment a light of understanding hit his brain, he would suddenly become human, attempt to back pedal, and then begrudgingly apologize.It was this that made the show. When Michael left the office, the curtain should have closed, the lights turned up, and we should have been made to leave our seats. Instead, seasons 8 and 9 continued to turn the carcass over and make a mockery of the quirks of each character, way, way over emphasizing the suddenly, equally quirky traits of the staff. If it's one person being a fool and all around staring in awe and disbelief, that's an out of the ordinary moment. If everyone is cavorting around foolishly, there's no awe or disbelief.Here's the primary example: Michael tells the new temp Ryan to play along with a prank he intends to play on the receptionist Pam. Ryan, not yet aware of Michael's insanity, nods, and Michael calls for Pam.Pam walks into the manager's office, and Michael informs her that his choice in which employee to fire in their ongoing campaign of downsizing has been made simpler. Because she has been identified as an office supply thief of potentially thousands of dollars over 3 years of employment, she will not only be terminated, but will not even qualify for severance because of the punitive nature of her dismissal.Ryan shakes his head, non-verbally disavowing any participation in the ""prank"" as Michael stifles a gleeful chortle. Pam, however, begins to frown and denies the accusation, claiming that she has not even stolen so much as a paper clip, but Michael casts her plea aside and tells her to clean out her workspace.Pam begins to cry profusely, a reaction Michael at ONLY THAT MOMENT realizes is a bad turn. He promptly cries, ""You've been 'punked'"" and laughs, sticking to his joke even as it careens into a deadly plummet. Pam calls him a jerk and runs off.In another episode, Michael makes small talk with Pam and mentions the common phrase, Thank God it's Friday, and that it's another day overworked and underpaid. Pam's only reaction is to say, ""I know what you mean,"" and Michael suddenly becomes stern. He says, ""if you are unhappy with your compensation, bring it up with HR.""Michael is clearly a character with huge flaws that all the other cast members have to tip toe around in order to get a solid day's work accomplished. None of the other characters exhibited signs of silliness, but as the seasons went on, the characters evolved their own various issues that, while making them unique, also made them all seem like cartoons. They stop tip-toeing and begin bumbling around Michael Scott style.Jim and Pam's relationship was the other huge staple of the show. Just because they're married doesn't mean their ""adventure"" is over. I married my wife and it felt like life had only just BEGUN at that moment. Pam should have been able to make something of her art. When she failed, it felt like the show was saying, ""Just give it up, kids. You're going to stay mediocre regardless."" Jim's ambition to become a sports agent should have been much smaller, and he a lot more understanding of what he's putting his wife through. It's like nice, sweet, cool Jim has been replaced by Jack@ss Jim. If that's what we're left with, then none of his good moments, kind deeds, and hard choices have EVER mattered. He's just going to end up a douche eventually. NICE!",Negative
"There is very little I could possibly say to actually describe Zach Stone Is Gonna Be Famous, except to repeat as others have already stated, THE FUNNIEST and the WEIRDEST thing I've ever seen. A boy graduates from high school and the next day, instead of planning to go off to college, is determined that he will achieve grand fame. He has no talent of any kind, but in today's society this could be normal thinking.I love this show. Totally and completely love it. Americans are dedicated to the worship of fame, so why not have a life like Zach Stone?I mean, really.... Why not? Well, the least you can do is watch this show and you'll be that much closer. Perhaps, you too, could ""make people happy.""",Positive
"I've been watching for the last few seasons, but realized I had never watched the first season so I gave it a watch.",Positive
"This season is disappointing after the previous 3. It's been glammed up too far, and frankly the quality of the artists is really lacking. This was disappointing considering how well the previous seasons had goneThe idea of having Michael Westmore as an advisor is a great one but it fails because it is not well used and you don't get to learn anything from this great man. I would far rather sacrifice celebrity judges for a return to better quality",Positive
The true appeal of this TV series comes from philosophic questions posed be John Teller in his book/letter to his sons and then in Jackson Teller's own journal/letters to his sons concerning the &#34;big questions&#34; of life.  That's why I refer to the show as Philosophy on Harlies and other similar quip-tic phrasing.,Positive
I'm really hooked on this series.  Interesting how actors that also worked in Deadwood seem to keep showing up.  The only way it could be better for me is to have more episodes per season.,Positive
"The problem with this show is that the Conservatives are going to look at it and go - YEAH! Right On! That's what I'm talking about?And the Liberal are going to watch it and say - ""Wow! Don't we look cool.""None of them are going to get that they are being skewered in the extreme.The American people are going to watch and think - Yeah, that's pretty much what I thought - corrupt to the core.Very funny characters including the long suffering Assistants. Hypocrisy and phoniness abound, which of course it true to the course.I see great potential if they can keep quality story lines coming. In the end, you've got a great cast, now you just need good writers to keep feeding them quality story lines.",Positive
"After 3 episodes, I really hope it doesn't go in this direction. Steven's remarks near the end of the episode made my stomach sink. Explanations for evolution as being ""given for a reason?"" Really? It could have been poor writing, but ""given"" implied a giver. ""Maybe we were given these powers to help people."" Seriously? Or, maybe, since these special powers are supposedly the next evolutionary step in human development, they were'nt 'given' but a natural evolutionary path. Uh,m see what I mean? Must everything revert back to the lowest thinking denominator? Yesm floods because we're 'given' punishment, and disease because were being punished, and wealth becsaue we were GIVEN wealth for a reason. Shoddy writing at best.How about this: If everything evolves with survival as the reason, then maybe evolution has provided powers to further the survival of the species. Simple, huh? Oh, but it's so much better to try and wedge in some sort of religiosity, right?I was starting to warm up to this series too in that there are some substantive points being made about morality, technology, human nature, instinct, etc. But if we're going to go the route of explanation by gods, forget it.Update: Episode, ""Thanatos.""This is my last episode. The writing is simply lazy and unbelievable. So, in this last episode, John teleports Jedikiah into an Ultra safe house with power modules in it, so then John can't use his powers to escape. Really? I mean, are we suppose to believe that this is even a possibility for a group of teleporting humans that have as their main escape teleportation?Are we suppose to believe that of all of the places on earth that John could have teleported,  he chose an Ultra safe house?Are we suppose to believe that the only place they could keep the head of Ultra was in their own safe place? I mean they could have teleportred him to any part of the earth and back 10 times day. You know, ""Hey, they're getting close again.""Are we suppose to believe that the above people haven't gotten caught based on how stupid a move John just made?Actually, it wasn't any sort of intelligent being who made the mistake, for if this were real, no one with even sub-par intelligence would have teleported to an Ultra safe house.The real problem is that it's just too bad that writers these days don't have the intellectual horsepower to see the contradictions their own creation; rather, they insult viewer intelligence to a point of disbelief.For ages 6-10 (and 10 is pushing it logically speaking)",Negative

"SUITS is smart, sassy, clever, sophisticated, timely and immensely entertaining! The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately.SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact.The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclich&eacute;d, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit! Grady Harp",Positive
"If you love murder, suspense, romance, sci fi, and mystery then this show is for you.  Can't wait for more new episodes to come out!  Also both the main guy and main girl are HOT!",Positive
"I think the only issue that I have with this movie is that the characters are some of the most suplid ones I have ever seen, speaking and saying nothing but bulls*** and acting as pussies.Other than that the film is pretty intense with good special effects and a twist ending that is trully remarkably frightening.Still, I sugest you better check this one out in Netflix, and if you end up liking it, then buy this disc.",Negative
I truly liked the series but it appears that there was never an ending and the series just ended. In other words the series just left me hanging looking for more and I never got it.,Positive
"I thought that this series was going to be good when I watched a preview, but I did not realize how great it would turn out to be. I have to admit that when I first heard about this series, I thought to myself that Kevin Bacon was very ambitious in taking on a Television series, but I have to say the suspense and the mystery of this show keeps you always guessing who to trust. With every twist and turn of the plot, you have to wonder who is playing who.This is one of the best new dramas out there right now and I am glad I purchased the season pass.",Positive
Began watching this at the suggestion of my older daughter who is a Stephen King fan. It is fun to watch on Amazon Prime and on my schedule. It is convenient also since I receive a notice when the next episode is available. It will be good to have the &#34;mystery&#34; of the Dome and the intent behind it revealed.,Positive
"This season was really good. The cast really work's together. I really got into the story lines, it's all coming together.",Positive
Key and Peel - that's the number one reason for the 5 star rating.  Loved these guys on MAD TV and were thrilled to find them on Amazon.,Positive
"What's not to love about New Orleans? As a resident here, it's easy to roll my eyes at the inclusion of Katrina rebuilding (seriously, people, it's been seven years, there are a lot more issues than that going on), gators, beignets, and Mardi Gras beads,, but it's great that the producers roll back past the expected cliches and bring us to the Vietnamese culture that permeates here, the love we have for custuming on Halloween, and local beloved figures like Leah Chase and Kermit Ruffins. The fact that they cheftestants have been to Dong Phuong and Vaughan's is impressive. As well as the area's bounty of local ingredients from the land, the swamp, and the Gulf. It's a lot of fun to watch.",Positive
I really enjoyed this episode. It was well cast and had some decent writing. The first episode did a great job establishing each character and what their drive was. This should definitely be made into a full series because it's great.,Positive
They did a nice job.  Characters were interesting.  Plots plausible and stimulating.  Good resolution to issues.  Dialog allowed to be genuine.,Positive
The overall premise of the story is good. The fact that the only people sent down are teenagers? Please. The whole thing is dreadful.,Negative
We came across this show on our amazon prime account and started watching it. Even though it would be more of a &#34;teenager&#34; type of show it was entertaining.  We have many nights when there is nothing on cable and go searching for something decent to watch.,Positive
"It's not the greatest show I've ever seen, however, it keeps me watching and I love the camaraderie between the two male leads, Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams  Now, let's talk about the women.  Gina Torres is spectacular as are the other two ladies, Meghan Markle as Rachel (a paralegal) and Sarah Rafferty as Donna, Mr. Macht's secretary.  They are the three sparklers on the show and can bedazzle you without trying.  Rick Hoffman plays the Rumplestiltskin of the group named Louis Litt.  (Mary Tyler Moore once had a line where she called Lou Grant ""Louis"" when she was berating him and it was one of the funniest lines she ever read because Louis sounds like something you would call someone when you were belittling him for his total lack of smarts.  The name is perfect for Mr. Hoffman in this role and he plays it beautifully.  On the whole, this is one of the better law shows because it is smart an funny.  The men, with the exception of Mr. Hoffman, are handsome and the women are ""che magnifique"".",Positive

"The show contains a group of young interns who are completely relatable.  The biggest draw of course is the incomparable Bebe Neuwirth! Her song was great.  The comedy was good, but the show is a bit dry.  I would attribute this to the show being in its early stages, and the actors ( and the show) getting into their groove.  I would definitely watch this show and add it to my most revered DVR list.",Negative

"Each episode in Crime Inc. runs about 25 minutes and documents about 5 crimes.  Each crime is documented with excellent black and white photos taken at the time of the crime.  Ideal for those who prefer just the facts, with no dramatization.  Very well done",Positive
I was a little disappointed in this season... The plot line was weak and never really found its groove. But still enjoyable to watch,Positive

"Although I was glad when the new season finally aired and I did purchase it immediately, and have watched it more than once, the overall tempo seemed rushed as if it was hastily thrown together. I am dissappointed that this is the last season but I remain a fan. Well worth the money as far as crime shows go.",Positive
"The tagline for Magnolia Pictures ""360"" is ""Everything comes full circle."" That's really about the only thing ""360"" has going for it. ""City of God"" director Fernando Meirelles is at the helm with a cast that includes Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Ben Foster, and Anthony Hopkins. The unfortunate thing is these actors really only feel like they're filling a void and don't really make themselves totally useful.""360"" jumps all over the world; Vienna, Bratislava, Paris, London, Colorado, and finally Phoenix. Seeing how all of the characters connect to one another is really the only drawing factor of the film. You're mostly left feeling like you could've spent a lot more time with certain characters instead of being introduced to so many. Ben Foster is a great example. His character just begins to get interesting when you only see him briefly in montages for the rest of the film. Anthony Hopkins has one really emotional scene during an AA meeting, but mostly feels underused. Jude Law and Rachel Weisz are criminally under-featured. Weisz seems to be rehashing her performance from ""The Deep Blue Sea"" except Rose is a watered down version of Hester Collyer. Meanwhile, Michael Daly (Law) mostly just acts suspicious and then kind of just admits to everything in the long run without much effort. It all just feels so fruitless.How these characters are connected aren't really all that interesting the majority of the time. More often than not, somebody is cheating on somebody else. Aside from Tyler (Foster) and the Older Man (Hopkins), being unfaithful or using sex to make a living is an underlying theme for everyone else. It's just really disappointing. ""360"" initially has this ""21 Grams"" meets ""Closer"" kind of potential and yet isn't nearly as good as either of those films.The drama is edited in a really unique way though. Its execution is a little odd, but is also really intriguing. At certain points in the film, the camera will show several characters on screen at once despite being in different areas of the world. So the screen will be divided into four vertical strips that are devoted to one specific character. Later on, during a phone call, the screen is divided into two horizontal strips featuring both individuals on the phone; one in each strip. The most interesting is when Sergei (Vladimir Vdovichenkov) is driving through a tunnel. The lights in the tunnel begin swirling around the screen which eventually transitions to the side of a parked car. It's just a very unusual editing technique.""360"" feels a bit too overzealous for its own good. While connecting so many characters to one another is extremely impressive on one hand, the characters themselves mostly feel very flat and underdeveloped overall. The film makes good on its promise of coming full circle, but there are so many half written stories in between that the experience leaves you feeling like there's no substance whatsoever.""360"" comes off as introductory without much filling. The intersection is one thing, but what about the road that gets you there? Shouldn't you have time to admire the scenery and get to know at least one person at more than face value during the adventure? ""360"" is a carousel that gets caught up in its own whirlwind and doesn't utilize or know how to appreciate its talent properly.",Negative
"I want my money back! I DID NOT PAY FOR 16 seconds of commercials before the show or 2 min of commercials after! Your commercials eat up the limited internet usage that I have way out here in the country. I DID love amazon vidoes when it first came out and I have been a VERY loyal customer, and how have I gotten re-paid? By Amazon sneaking in commercials that I DON'T WANT TO WATCH and I PAID so that I would not have to watch!!!! STOP the commercials or start loosing customers!!!",Negative
"This offers plenty to enjoy: bad guys you love to hate, secrets at the highest levels, and spectacular effects. The big sequence at the end, explosions and all, is one of the best to date. The Captain America character recalls a day when heroes were truly heroic - there's not a trace of irony to be seen anywhere. And of course, Stan Lee's brief appearance adds an amusing touch.Perhaps I should have said &#34;the amusing touch.&#34; The only one. This takes itself so seriously that it borders on grim. And, now that we've gotten used to characters with human flaws, failings, and uncertainty, the Captain comes across as one-dimensional, as if the only crayons in the box were red, white, and blue.So, it's well put together, with great production (and moral) values, and certainly popcorn-worthy. But it's not one I'll come back to.-- wiredweird",Positive
"It seems after about the 5th season there are cast changes every season and season 8 was no different. Still the writing and acting is good and the new characters fit rather quickly. Also the writing is improving because the dialogue given the actors is more natural and less stilted. Over all, still a good show to watch. I never watched it when it was on in prime time but am enjoying the show, season after season, viewing on Amazon's video on demand.",Positive

"In all honesty I didn't know what I was getting myself into with this British film directed by Ben Wheatley.  I almost pulled the plug as the first act seemed to drone on endlessly with no point.  In addition, although I'm no newcomer to various English accents coming out of the U. K., no matter how loud I turned up the sound, I couldn't comprehend what half the words were.  So my fellow Americans, my advice is go ahead and put on the English subtitles, shift gears and hang on for one of the most head-scratching films you'll see.The movie evolves from a domestic squabble between Shel (MyAnna Buring), a former Swedish soldier and Jay (Neil Maskell), a temporarily unemployed killer-for-hire.  After a job went south in Russia, Jay's nerves are a bit shaky but his partner in crime, Gal (Michael Smiley), convinces him it's time to get back in the game.  They do and their targets are focused on a priest and likely pedophile and a porn distributor.At this stage we're not too concerned about their fate.  They deserve what they get.  Yet something is amiss.  They thank Jay before their demise.  Events become more and more unsettling as their search for their targets drives them into areas they (and I) didn't see coming.  The occult and Satanism show their faces.  As the movie shifts into high gear, it also changes tone, now entering some scary and gory horror.  And Wheatley and his writing partner, Amy Jump, don't pull their punches.  I'm still trying to figure out what I just saw.  I suspect you might too.",Negative
We are enjoying this amazing series. Sherlock is cast perfectly with Jonny Lee Miller. The choice for a Doctor Watson was a surprise in many ways but Lucy Lui has been quite interesting in this role and has proven to us that she is the perfect choice for Watson as well.we look forward to every show and it is a &#34;do not miss&#34; for us.,Positive

"This series started for me like Breaking Bad - had heard of it, but never watched it. I watched earlier seasons and was hooked. I had my wife watch an episode and she was hooked. In short, this series is about a motorcycle club and their &#34;adventures&#34;. It has a unique way of exploring who are really the good guys and who are the bad guys.

"This film is dead on.  Anyone who goes to the doctor, whether they have health insurance or not, should be concerned about health care in the United States. It's purpose is not to improve the general health of American citizens, but to micromanage diseases with expensive drugs or procedures.Since viewing this movie, I've thought about my past experience with medical providers, and I have cause to wonder why I was prescribed medications, why I underwent procedures that I might not have needed, and why so many expensive tests are performed when they weren't necessary. Last week, I had to undergo tests in order to gain access to a specialist. You can't even have a conversation with a specialized doctor unless you pay for the test first!  That makes absolutely no sense.One of the subjects in this film has over a dozen stents, which, come to find out, she didn't even need, but now has to live with for the rest of her life. It made me think about my mom, who also had over a dozen stents, and was at her primary care office several times every week since one appointment could only last a maximum of 15 minutes. My mom went through two bouts of breast cancer. The second time, she developed an infection that almost killed her.I want to thank those who participated in making this movie.",Positive
"I don't hate this movie, but I don't perticulary like it either. It has good points, nice characters, a good pace, tense situations and good fight scenes. However this film has many flaws that drop my opinion of it. First, this film sometimes throws in cheezy moments or humor that undermine the serious situation. Second, the fact that this movie was made after a true sequel to the original makes me feel dissapointed with it. Had this been the 2nd Rec movie made, it would've been recived better as the series would be viewed as an anthology series rather then a series with one plot and another movie thrown into it (Halloween suffered the same fate). Finally this movie never explains if it takes place before or after the others. Not revealing that detail makes it seem like this movie was just a cash grab.Ultimatly it's not crap, but I didn't enjoy it that much.",Negative

Because later, Our Heroine is in the catacombs with CrazyPsycho ('cuz you gotta have one of those), and she has a BIG (cardboard, *flammable*) box of matches. Any THINKING adult would say, ""Hmmmn...we're LOST and need our light to last as long as possible.""You could make at least 5 mini-torches out of that (again, LARGE) matchbox, as well as from (surely) some crap in CrazyPsycho's pack, but nooooo.

It's actually pretty much the silly thought that first occurred to me during the sequence when the dome comes down. But it was so silly, I dismissed it.NOPE! IT'S PRETTY SILLY! I can't believe they're dragging this out past Season 1. This would have made an interesting mini-series (do they still do those?), but I'm done with this show.

"I'm a &#34;fan&#34; of true crime -- not the crimes themselves, of course, but rather the genre -- and have read many books and watched many television shows within the genre.  And anyone who is &#34;in&#34; to true crime surely has his or her own favorites, and like I've written ad nauseum, what I always want to know:  why did the UNSUB commit the crimes, what did the police do to catch that UNSUB, and what was going on historically at the time?  Sure, the victims are important, but only from the sense of victimology, as that helps us answer question number one above.Without flogging a dead horse, I still think that maybe the worst true-crime book ever was &#34;Green River Running Red,&#34; to which I've called &#34;GRRR&#34; and with good reason; it is a snooze fest as it really only discusses the victims, and not in any interesting way.  My apologies to Ann Rule, but only sort of.Why am I bringing all of this all up?  Well, I've probably seen every episode of this television show, and I would say that it dances dangerously close to the feet of the victims without changing partners occasionally with the UNSUB.  Oh sure, they bring up the suspects and maybe even the perpetrator by the end.  But I would say that this show does try to pander to the emotions of sympathetic viewers a bit too much for my taste.  And I believe that this show might appeal more to females than males.  At least that would be my guess.  (Whenever I watch a show or read a book, I always try to imagine what John Douglass, the great FBI profiler, would think of it.  My guess:  he'd watch but it wouldn't be a must see.  Just guessing.)I do really like the production values here though, and the attention to period detail is borderline fantastic.  And the camerawork is top notch; in some regards this show reminds me of &#34;Murder Comes to Town,&#34; another show on ID TV that I surely appreciate more than this one.  But I will admit that here, the production crew does a really good job of making you feel as if you've been transported back in time and are actually witnessing events as if you are a fly on the wall.  Albeit a pretty old wall.I've been hit and miss with this show, but overall, it is definitely worth a peek.  That peek will make you feel as if you're looking back in time, and it does remind you that crime existed even back in the &#34;good ol' days.&#34;",Positive
"In the pilot, the look and feel of this show does for the Bionic Woman, what they did for Battlestar on the Sci-Fi channel( if not quite as gritty). Where as the original was just silly, this seems (so far) as a well thought out story, with people that we may come to care about for (good or ill).The subplots, of Jamie's reletionships with her sister, and evil crazy counterpart, for me (at least so far) make for good drama.They've got my interest, I just hope the show lives up to the pilot.",Positive
"Background: A Selkie is a mythological sea creature that can become human.This movie consisted of the following stereotypic formula pieces tossed together to form the script such as: single divorced alcoholic fisherman; disabled daughter; dysfunctional mom and step father; suspicious town folk; homespun priest; Selkie brings good luck to the fisherman and daughter; criminal element added as a threat to the Selkie.Overall this Selkie interpretation seemed disjointed and shallow; lacking emotional depth and mystery. Not as good as ""The Seventh Stream"".",Negative
"This is a great show for light entertainment.  The acting is solid, the characters bring personality to conventional molds, and the imagery is overall fantastic.  The light, colors, and textures of Florida are my favorite part of the show, to be honest.  I live in a cold place, so an hour with The Glades is like a little vacation.",Positive
I like this show because of how real it is. you follow the detectives on each case from start to end. the city of Indianapolis has the most solved murder cases in the United States. I wouldn't recommend watching if you have a sensitive stomach.,Positive

"&#8220;Cutie and the Boxer&#8221; is a documentary about the life of an 80-year-old Japanese Ushio Shinohara, a New York-based artist who has created &#8220;boxing painting,&#8221; and his wife Noriko, herself an artist (whose drawing is used to recount how they met each other in America about 40 years ago). Directed by first-timer Zachary Heinzerling, &#8220;Cutie and the Boxer&#8221; captures the complicated nature of being an artist, though some part of the film can be misleading.First, this is a documentary about artists, but the film seems more interested in their life than in their art. The film may show you how Ushio creates a boxing painting or how the couple receives a visit from a Guggenheim curator, but you are not going to learn much about their art in the context of modern art history.For &#8220;Cutie and the Boxer&#8221; is primarily a love story, and a very intriguing one. The film is a fascinating portrait of a long-married couple who have seen a lot, and as such it is touching and thought-provoking.To focus the relationship between the couple, &#8220;Cutie and the Boxer&#8221; ignores the career of Ushio (called affectionately &#8220;Gyu-chan&#8221; by Noriko or &#34;Cutie&#34;), who was one of the most visible faces in Japan's avant-garde art movements in the early 1960s. Some aspects of their life including the presence of their son are only briefly touched upon but not explored.So, we are allowed to see just part of the artists&#8217; life, which must have been much more eventful than the film shows. Still, &#8220;Cutie and the Boxer&#8221; manages to give you a glimpse of what a life as (and with) an artist can be.",Positive
"This show is absolutely terrible- I went into this pilot really wanting to like it as I love post apocalyptic shows/movies and really love Chris Carter's previous work but this show is flat out bad. The story makes zero sense at all, the characters are all extremely unlikable- especially the french woman who is supposed to be the main protagonist and to be perfectly honest- there is no chance any of these people would stick together within five minutes if this actually went down. The plot has ADD and skips all over, I watched this with some friends and we all went into this with an extremely open mind. There are many other good selections for amazon to pick up and I really hope this is not one of them. Don't be a sheep! actually *watch* the full pilot before you post a review please! we all love chris carter but this junk stinks. I don't post reviews but after seeing this get a bunch of positive ratings I had to do my part and tell it like it is- THIS SHOW IS AWFUL.",Negative
IMHO...Good thing this show is ending. Everything so far this season just seems cartoonish and manipulative story-wise. It's like the writers ran out of the good stuff so now there just throwing everything in there to run out the clock. Last two seasons were a lot better. This year the show's isn't grounded or compelling. I think people are watching just to see what wacky improbable plot point is going to pop out and shock us next. And really...did they have to revisit the ricin cigarette yet again? Enough with that nonsense!,Negative
I recently saw season 1 and I was hooked. I love all the characters especially Gabriel Mann. His witty one liners have me coming back each week.,Positive
"NEVER BORING!Interesting and different.  A great escape from the mundane.I like the characters, every week a different challenge and the characters evolve.",Positive
I've been watching this season 2 at work during my lunch and everyone laughs because I yelling at the computer.  So far this season is AMAZING,Positive
"If you don't get the significance of the title that is binary code.  And this show is a real keeper.  Funny, Witty mixed with a little drama.  A must see.",Positive
"Good script, excellent acting, love the way the plot keeps moving.  This series employs excellent directors and cinematographers.  The reveal at the end of this episode is worth the wait.  I love it when I can't predict the direction a story is going to go.",Positive
"Tosh wows me every time I see his show.  He undoubtedly is one of the quickest wits on television and there is no length or line he won't cross to get a laugh.  Even when I feel his humor might be a bit inappropriate I find that I am still laughing at it because there is always some truth to the joke.  You know, when is the right time to joke about somebody who has died recently?  Well, a joke is going to be made in the future so even if it is an hour or two after the demise of the person, it is the future isn't it?  As inappropriate as it may seem, death is death and the dead are always fair game.  That's a sad rule, but a true one.",Positive
"Ray Winstone (you may recognize him from the movie ""Sexy Beast) is Vincent, the head of his own P.I. firm. He is assisted by his small crew of associates. Vincent may appear to be a tough guy, and he can be. He delivers tough news with directness, yet ultimately has a heart of gold. He takes on cases that often have excellent plots and the interaction and caring of his staff is wonderful. This is a mystery/drama above all else, but can be funny and touching at the right times. I only wish there were more episodes.",Positive
No great sport sitcoms since Arliss!! Let's go!! Can't wait to see this show.Can't believe someone hasn't made a show like this before now.,Positive
It is great! I enjoy the werewolf and vampire shows where they are trying to live in both the supernatural world and the normal world we all live in and especially young people at stages in their lives that all of us find difficult and unsettling. Their bonds and loyalties may start differently but essentially they are all forged from the same thing and that is trust and the desire to survive.,Positive

"Watched all four season - won't make sense if you don't start with the first season, and don't skip an episode. Well written and acted, wonderful interwoven subplots and more than one major plot mixed with the primary premise of the overall story. This is a series remake of the classic French flic 'La Femme Nikita' and if you have never see this 1990 movie, it is a must to watch first - here is a link to the original - [...]- here is a link to the English remake in 1993 with a different name - [...] watch the movies, then watch this fantastic series.

"After seeing the departure of Smallville and Eureka, this show was great, much like the Libraian and National treasure this show finds artifacts that have powers and the ability to change human behavior for good or bad, Arty is great and if you are Jewish you will like it, the boss of the show in some episodes makes reference to the Talmud, and Is Jewish, A great show with new adventures every week",Positive

"I was a bit worried the BBC weren't going to make this available, as it turns out they are just running 2 weeks behind the UK airing of the show.It was worth the wait because Clarkson, Hammond and May have gotten the new series off to a fantastic start and their preview of what is coming over the series looks like it is only going to get better. The usual balance of their petrol head coverage along with their usual antics filled events shows that they still have plenty to offer the viewer.",Positive
"I won't repeat what others already say, but this is a terrific movie and had some nice unexpected twists. Great directing and acting.",Positive
Love this show.  It's been a real addiction.  We can hardly wait for the next episode.  The buildup of the plots and characters is superb and the cinematography is unparalleled.,Positive
This was one fun good TV show. And still is..But not at this price....I will sit tight.... And wait until it comes down..,Positive
i chose this rating because i enjoyed it. i dont like profanity so like movies without it. i would recommend this series.,Positive
my child loves it.  It is the ABC animal episode.  We don't generally like Dora but this specific episode is really cute and keeps my little guys attention.,Positive
The second season is even more entertaining than the first.  The plot thickens around the characters who try to hide their secrets.,Positive
"Really enjoyed this show.  Wish it had never been cancelled.  Not only was it entertaining, but informative as well.  I still am enjoying all three seasons.",Positive
"I'm not really a Hulk fan, but I decided to give this show a shot, since there are other characters (like Batman) that I prefer in TV and movie form, and can't really get into the comics. The first episode was pretty good, with most of the jokes being elevated by Seth Green's charisma, and the plot being more relate-able with him as the human fish out of water, but once he turned into a hulk, the show seems to have lost the humor and charm. It seems to have become everyone making bad jokes, and Rick Jones saying how awesome everything is. I just couldn't get into it. Full disclosure: I only got 3 episodes in before deciding its fate on my schedule. It could always get better.",Negative
"A must for all the BBC detective addicts out there.  It is possible to see, feel, and smell the gruesome crimes that the Whitechapel detectives get involved.  I think Rupert Perry-Jones is brilliant.",Positive
I really liked the early episodes but the story line just became to boring to continue watching. I think the angel was the best character in the entire series.,Negative
"I didn't think this show would be very interesting, but just happened to stumble across an episode on vacation one day.  Like ""The Apprentice"", ""Survivor"", and other competitive reality shows, we sometimes see the worst side of human nature; but I believe that it is informative and entertaining to watch.  I have no interest in modeling, but have developed a respect for the women and men who do.  There's a lot more work involved than I previously thought.  Tyra seems like a great person.",Positive
"One sister plans her future in obsessive detail like a 1950's debutante.  The other is more bohemian and lives for the moment.  For once Hollywood doesn't blame the struggles of either sister on immaturity or selfishness of boyfriends, parents, or even each other.  Some middle aged women may be shocked or angry at how many deeply personal truths are revealed.  The ending is unforgettable.",Positive
Well...all that (SPOILER ALERT)For an Alien SquidWow...kind of a big let down...and the rental cost was WAYYYYY too much for this garbage.,Negative
"A well done series. Good TV programmes are hard to come by but when they materialize they are good. Except for the psychologist role, which is whiny, psychobabble nonsense, the other roles were complex and full of possibility. Alphas' supermutants eclipsed in realism, drama and overall entertainment those of another recent mutant series ""Heroes."" Heroes had mutants which were entertaining but lacking in possibility of drama other than what they could do with their powers. In a word, except for their powers they were flat and stereotypical. Not so with the mutants in Alphas. They are complex and full of possibility for story angles. Of course, it had to be cancelled. But we have two good seasons to watch and rewatch.",Positive

"I didn't like the way they ended it, if they would have been given the opportunity to film the movie to wrap things up after the show was cancelled like they were originally going to do it would have been ok.This season had some good points, but overall it lacked the same punch the others had.",Negative
"Filled with good humor and likable characters , this series has potential .Plot moved quickly to establish the comic potential .",Positive
"Some complained that 2 was just like 1, so what, that's why we liked it. They tried to give us what we enjoyed from the first one. My issues with 2 came from the the far-fetched points of the movie. Liam listening to everything around him while blindfolded, then being able to tell where his location was and tell his daughter later...pretty unbelievable. Other than a few things like this, the movie had good action and tense moments. Liam delivers another strong performance, he never snoozes through a role. I do hope in Taken 3 they create some new scenarios and give it a new spin on the premise.",Positive
Just love this show and the thought and concept behind it.  You hav e to really wonder since we all truly know we are not the only living creatures in the massive universe.,Positive

I thoroughly enjoyed viewing Season 5 of Dear Genevieve!  Each show brought  new ideas and design tips I can use.,Positive
"I don't mind suspending my hold on reality to enjoy a good show.  But this show asks too much.  These spies are so devoted to the &#34;mother country&#34; that they jeopardize their kids.  I'm sure Russians love their children, so what's up with this absurd notion?  Then they just happen to have a new neighbor who just happens to be an FBI agent recently back from deep cover and assigned to counterespionage.  I mean c'mon.  Then the scene in the garage getting the jumper cables out of the trunk where the hostage is lying bound and gagged for days and the agent gets close enough that the smell coming from that trunk would have knocked him over!  Then the spies dump a body in the drink and proceed to have sex at the scene!!!  And the ending was just plain ridiculous.  Seeing the husband spy in the shadows after the agent leaves his garage was laughable.  What's he live in there with his gun at the ready?  No thanks!  You have to do better than this.",Negative
Plenty of snark mixed with loads of action along with a storyline threaded throughout the entire series makes this a must-see.,Positive
"My complaint is that they didn't show Les cleaning the turtle and snake.  Even if he didn't want to show that on TV, I'd hope he filmed it to include in a non-TV version of the show; I'd like to see how it's done.  I really enjoy the harmonica playing and all the survival tips, like how to make fire by rubbing 2 sticks together, and how to prepare grasshoppers to eat.  In this series there is no ""fourth wall""; i.e. Les is constantly talking with the audience.  Besides that, there is no attempt to hide the cameras.  This series is about survival, but it's also about filming a show about survival.  Les doesn't just have to show how he climbed up a hill, he has to set up the camera, climb the hill, then walk back down and get the camera!  Plus, he has 50 pounds of camera stuff to haul around.  Les seems like a pretty smart guy, and I'll bet he has enough footage to make a whole show without talking to the audience or showing the cameras.  He really is a good camera man and has some great footage of wild scenery.  I've watched all the shows from season 1 and enjoyed all of them, and I look forward to seeing the other seasons.",Positive
"Although Ziva has left us, the stories we have been offered have expanded the characterization of those who remain.  The relationship between Gibbs and his dad is truly special and insightful.  Not every episode includes all cast members.  I find thatinteresting.  It does open up new ways to write and explore.  Mike Franks was one of my favorites.  I love how he comes back to us through memories.  The episode re. the Coast Guard Captain and Gibbs was powerful.  Love seeing characters from past seasonsrevisit NCIS.  I watch few shows on TV, but this is one I've followed since it's beginning.  Our household watches reruns whenever they pop up on screen.  The show holds it's excellence.",Positive
"This season continues to please with it's twists & turns. When characters behaving predictably, it is believably so. The last episode clearly shows that the season ended and the producers pulled the plug without completing the story line, leaving the audience wondering what happens next?  Or what happens to conclude the story line?  Maybe the moving coming out in March will pick up the thread. However I hope to see some of the same characters. We have a girls night out planned for it.",Positive
Vincent D'Onofrio is the best. I miss this show so much. I can watch over and over and never get tired of this show!,Positive
I guess I'm still a kid at 71 years old but I love this series. I really think it's aimed at an adult audience not really for small children.,Positive
"It was what it was.  With approximately a billion jokes tailored &#34;for the fans,&#34; it's an easy pass if you aren't already a fan of the series.  There isn't much of a story here, and it about equals the quality of the show it's based on.  That said, if you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it and laugh harder than everyone else in the room.  It'll make you intolerable to everyone else, but you'll feel special.",Negative
"My daughter talked me into watching The Walking Dead and I started with season one on Netflix. Fell in love with the show so just had to buy season 3 from Amazon as soon as it came out.

Surprised that I like the show so much and was thrilled to see the beginning of season 4 that started on Sunday, 10/13/13.",Positive
"""Under The Skin"" (2013 release from Scotland; 108 min.) brings the story of several aliens (one man, one woman) whom we see take the shape on a human. The woman, played by Scarlett Johansson, starts picking up one guy after another, leading them to her house where she ""takes care of business"" (how? I'm not going to spoil). Eventually the woman tries to fit better in and even tries getting into a 'real' relationship. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: this is the latest movie from British director Jonathan Glazer, best know for bringing us ""Sexy Beast"" some years ago. His previous movie ""Birth"" was also a take on things that are not quite your normal situation, but here he goes one better, and then some. Second, the science fiction tone of the movie is brought expertly, from the opening scenes where we're not sure what exactly is happening, it looks to be something in space like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  Third, there are a number of stunning, if at times unsettling, scenes, including the extended beach scene, and the scene with the 26 yr. old virgin guy. Fourth, the movie is set in Scotland, and while we get glimpses of some of its beauty, the overall feeling is pretty grey and grim, and hence not necessarily an inviting ""postcard from Scotland"" (in contrast to that other seminal Scottish film from 30 years ago, ""Local Hero""). Fifth, there is a very abstract soundtrack that matches the movie perfectly, scored by British artist Mica Levi (a/k/a Micachu). Last but certainly not least, what can you say about the performance from Scarlett Johansson. Yes, there is nudity, and quite a bit of it, but far more important is the astonishing way in which she portrays the alien. By coincidence, she is currently in the theatres also with another science-fiction movie, albeit one of a very different kind, namely ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", which I have no interest in seeing. I'm sure she collected a big check for that movie, and if that is what allows her to take on more challenging indie roles such as this movie and ""Don Jon"", then I'm all for it. I guess I wasn't quite sure what to expect from ""Under The Skin"", but I can tell you that was I saw far surpassed whatever expectations I had, including an unforgettable ending.""Under The Skin"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. The matinee showing I saw this at was not particularly well attended, but that could just as much be a reflection of the very nice weather outside. Either way, if you are in the mood for the antithesis of that other current science fiction movie starring Johansson, you cannot go wrong with ""Under The Skin"", which is a very original, if at times creepy, but never boring sci-fi. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Positive
"King Bagsecg (James Cosmo) is on his death bed. He tasks his son Steinar (Charlie Bewley) to find his older brother Hakan (Elliot Cowan) who had been banned. Steinar travels with a group of men to find Ivar (Ivan Kaye) who may know his whereabouts. Steinar has a brother (Finlay Robertson) and half brother(Theo Barklem-Biggs), neither of which are warriors.Ivar prefers the companionship of young boys. The film utilizes grindhouse style in its introductions and fighting. Both the Vikings and Saxons have British accents. I thought the Vikings had thicker accents. There were numerous anachronisms in the speech, slang, and general ideology. The ending of the film had me scratching my head as it turns into a bizarre apocalyptic Mad Max scene.I do not consider this a pseudo history in the same vein as the others that have been released, it is too far off the track.Makes for an odd historical rental.Parental Guide: F-bombs, nudity, no sex.",Negative
"""Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"" stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott Adkins, Andrei ""The Pit Bull"" Arlovski and Dolph Lundgren (credited in that order). The new Universal Solider film is directed by John Hyams, responsible for so-so action flick ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"" (2009) and just plain terrible ""Dragon Eyes"" (2012).First things first. ""Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"" is not a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. Van Damme's role here is only as an extended cameo, and his fight scene is rather brief, and so is that of Dolph Lundgren. I don't even know if I should call it a Universal Soldier movie, as in ""Day of Reckoning"" there is hardly any sci-fi element that was still seen in ""Regeneration.""Still I expected something exciting from the film as the star of ""Day of Reckoning"" is Scott Adkins, who can really do action. Adkins plays a man named John, who, heavily injured, wakes up in a hospital to learn that his beloved wife and daughter were brutally murdered by masked intruders. So far, so good.As the story goes on, however, it becomes clear that the film is going nowhere. Action is brutal and gory (that's fine), but terribly drawn-out and poorly edited. The confusing story (including the lengthy non-action opening scene that should be much shorter) doesn't make much sense. There is one decent car action sequence, but ... is Scott Adkins, a martial artist, hired for this?As you know, Van Damme, Adkins and Lundgren were also seen in ""The Expendables 2."" They are just part of the cast, but they did much better jobs there.",Negative
Sometimes an actor can go stale in a series but not David Suchet. He is as strong as at the start. These episodes are longer (1.75 hrs) than the usual ones - they must have been 2 partes on Masterpirece Mystery.,Positive

"Easily, the best TV series ever.  Never could lose a 100% of my empathy for Walter White.  Even the violence, which is routinely overdone on TV, was tolerable and never gratuitous.  Like Steven Colbert, I keep looking for a thread of the storyline to continue into a 'next season'.",Positive
"Mix together perfect acting, incredible writing, an amazing literary foundation, and beautiful people to get Zen. First, my minor nag is the slightly awkward mixture of English and Italian accents. It's very easy to move beyond that little quirk once the stories grab ahold--and a tight grasp they have. Each of the three 90-minutes episode is a mini-movie unto itself, but each builds on its predecessors.Unlike ""White Sands"" where the hero was truly incorruptible, Aurielo Zen skirts exceptionally close to the line. His reputation of the force's virtually only honest cop is so highly recognized. I often wondered how he could reconcile some choices. How can anyone live up to such a lofty aspiration. The truth is, by way of Zen, if you bend the rules--or extort political favors--for a seemingly good cause, it's all okay. But hey, that's the character and as a viewer or reader, we have to accept it or walk away.The stories were so engaging that the tiny inconsistencies or incongruities, if noticed, are forgivable. The character-driven stories were so encompassing that it was easy to lose myself inside them.Oh, and the stories are set in Rome. And there is a fairly steamy love-affair. And there are car chases, foot chases, fights, and various states of disrobing.",Positive
Is the new series 8 worth the price of $7.99 per episode (gulp!). Yep! I'm hoping we see a series 9 in the not to distant future. Highly recommend!,Positive
"The star (his name escapes me) is somewhat pretty and he knows it. He could use some humility lessons. Come to think of it though, at his age, I was probably the same way. I was reared in Florida and the one thing I remember about &#34;The Glades&#34;, and no native I remember ever used that term, is the smell. The odor was a funky, stifling, brackish, oppressive almost indescribable stink that always repulsed me. The only individuals that liked the odor were the critters that called it home.All the actors in this series seem to be aware of themselves and of course the ever present camera. Only occasionally do they become lost in their roles. This may be due to the sometimes weak plots. I mean I doubt I could get interested in a case about illegally imported, endangered birds. Of course it's a serious problem but not one worthy of a crime show plot. Still sometimes, the installments are mediocre enough to watch. I guess that's the reason I still tune the program in.",Negative
"the first couple episodes are the best (i am halfway thru the series). I think it has huge potential, but the writing staff is farting around. the actors are capable of exceptional work given a great script, but the scripts are a tad lame. The characters interaction is smooth until some clunky line of dialog, or stupid error  in contentuity (sp?) crops up. Like the robot guy (wow, can't remember the name, sorry) get all shot up, a la Terminator, while covering Kennex, but then in the next shot, his Tshirt is perfect, no bullet holes. that kind of stuff is just sloppy. spend less on the CG and more on the little stuff. Note to show producers: watch some Lost, and BSG if you need pointers, ok?",Negative
This Heist movie was hilarious and the.  plot twist was a total surprise.  Kurt Russell was so fun as an Evil Knieval motorcycle jockey.  Really fun!  The movie had flavor of the Big Lebowsky at times with Kurt's down and out Character and also some Ocean's Eleven with a Con well played.  No real female role to speak of.  The supporting cast was wonderful.  A very funny Guy Movie that my wife also enjoyed...,Positive
I was disappointed to learn ABC plans to drop the show. I would hope another network would consider it as it is entertaining and interesting to watch.,Positive

"I get suckered into a lot of lousy shows by the ""hype"" surrounding the show and all the glowing reviews here on Amazon and in the mainstream media.  This show is another one of those ""con"" jobs.  Sorry, folks, but this show is just plain lousy.  It's depressing.  It goes nowhere.  The characters constantly bicker and fight.  Almost all the characters are a-holes, jerky, uninteresting, unlikable, unsympathetic.  In short, this show was torture to watch.  And still believing the hype, I tortured myself more by watching seasons 2 and 3, hoping, praying, the show would somehow get better.  It doesn't.  The premise is good.  It could have been a good show.  But it is just written so poorly--unlikeable protagonists, cliched bad guys, a story that does not evolve--so the promising premise is never developed into anything good.  Even Bryan Cranston (who is a truly outstanding actor) seems bad in this.  His character has two notes, he's either bitter or angry.  The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show.",Negative
"It's that vaunted chemistry and the rich emotional content, and it's those terrific touches of humor. In ""The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond"" there's a great throwaway moment brought about by a publisher's crediting part of Temperance Brennan's success as a mystery author to her looks. Brennan decides to quit writing, and here's Booth talking fast to change her mind:- Brennan: ""I don't want to be a sexy scientist!""- Booth: ""Well, that's like me saying I don't want to be a sexy FBI Agent. We can't change who we are!"" And then Booth starts quoting a published review of one of her mysteries. One of those perfect throwaway moments.World-renowned forensic anthropologist Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan is as brusque and tactless as ever, as confounded by the subtleties of social decorum as ever (or as Sweets exclaims: ""She is wicked literal!""). Bones is still very much that intimidating icy intellect, still a wounded soul, and still solving murders. FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth is still the one with the people skills and that well-developed bump of intuition. More onions are peeled in this season as we learn even more about the underpinnings of our core characters. The absolute big draw of this show is that sizzle between David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel, their fabulous interplay tantalizing and frustrating the viewers. Could this be the season that they get together? Well, kind of, sort of. Taking what the show is giving, I wallow in their ever evolving relationship.Staying on the personal, Hodgins and Angela are trying to move past their break-up. ""The Skull in the Sculpture"" demonstrates that Angela is more ready to move on than Hodgins, and if you thought Angela was a free spirit before, well, now...  This episode also has Sweets demonstrating the best way ever to fire someone. Young FBI psychologist Lance Sweets, by the way, becomes a regular cast member in this season, and I like him more and more as each episode progresses, even if Booth and Bones continually treat him like a pesky little brother. Even Dr. Saroyan's past is delved into.Zack Addy, apprentice to the Gormagon Killer, has been institutionalized, which doesn't keep him from strolling out to help the squints on a baffling case. Still, this gives rise to a running theme, that of the rotating roster of interns as Saroyan and Bones attempt to fill Zack's spot, and the fun thing is that each of these interns comes with baggage. There's the morbid one, the excessively chirpy one, the one constantly dispensing trivia, etc. The most martyred one may well be that repressed intern who insists on keeping things professional at all times - except that, the squints being a tight bunch, he keeps getting exposed to a deluge of innuendo and gossip in the workplace.***Possible plot SPOILERS begin***There isn't really a running mystery arc to tie these episodes together - no one like the Gormagon Killer running around, for example. But that doesn't mean that the cases aren't gripping; some of them are really interesting. The season opens with ""Yanks in the U.K."" (or, as I like to call it, ""Booth Vs. England""), which plants Brennan and Booth in jolly old England, investigating a murder and running into a British version of themselves. In ""The Passenger in the Oven"" Bones and Booth are on a flight bound to China and have only four hours to solve a murder before the plane lands and Booth loses jurisdiction. ""Double Trouble in the Panhandle"" has Booth and Bones infiltrating the Big Top as ""Buck & Wanda and their Knives of Death,"" and their circus act is actually fraught with more suspense than in just about any other scene in this season.Some other favorites? In ""The Double Death of the Dearly Departed,"" Bones and Booth steal a corpse due for cremation from a funeral home, Bones believing that the body had been ""translated,"" which is Booth's made-up code for murder. ""Mayhem on a Cross"" unveils some dark stuff about Sweets' past, this episode also featuring the return of the awesome Stephen Fry as FBI shrink Gordon Gordon Wyatt. It also had me cracking up whenever Bones insisted on correctly pronouncing ""skalle"" (the Norwegian word for ""skull""). ""The Hero in the Hold"" features the return of the Grave Digger serial killer. ""The Princess and the Pear"" plonks Bones and Booth's temp replacement in the world of comic book conventions, and Bones finally gets another chance to flash her martial arts mojo.In ""The Critic in the Cabernet"" Bones drops a bomb on Booth and Booth gets advice from a cartoon character, a frivolous conceit which goes on to have a terrifying payoff. Finally Season 4 closes with a quirky fantasy episode featuring a re-shuffling of roles. In this reality, Dr. Saroyan and Booth's brother are homicide detectives and Booth and Bones are a married couple who run a nightclub and who end up as suspects in a murder case. It's neat that just about everyone is in this one.***Possible plot SPOILERS end now***BONES - SEASON FOUR comes in six discs and includes 22 of the 26 episodes. The bonus features are: extended scenes for three episodes: ""The Perfect Pieces in the Purple Pond,"" ""The Doctor in the Den,"" & ""The Girl in the Mask""; 2 deleted scenes (one in ""The Skull in the Sculpture,"" the other in ""The Passenger in the Oven,"" both featuring Angela and Hodgins having a conversation about Roxie); 5 and a half minutes of bloopers (""Skalle!""); ""Androgeny: Playing Haru Tanaka"" - guest actress Ally Maki delves into her dubiously gendered character (""Dr. Haru Tanaka"") in ""The Girl in the Mask""; and ""Squints in Training"" - this segment, which includes cast interviews, goes into this season's cast of recurring lab interns. Again no episode commentaries or cast interviews. Also, note that Season Four's first four episodes (""The Yanks in the UK, Parts 1 & 2,"" ""The Man in the Outhouse,"" & ""The Finger in the Nest"") are absent here, having instead been inserted inBones: The Complete Third Seasonas that set's featured bonus features.By the way, in the Grossest Corpse of the Season department, it's a tie between ""The Cinderella in the Cardboard"" and ""The Science in the Physicist.""

Purchased this before I found out I could view on hulu! The quality of the programs on Amazon is excellent and if you can spend the extra money its nice not to have all the commercials.,Positive
I literally had to pause it about 3 or 4 times because I was laughing so hard that I'd miss the next scene.  I would definitely be willing to purchase multiple multiple seasons of this show.  I really hope it gets picked up!,Positive

She had an interesting life and I was pleased to hear about her being defended against her daughter. The daughter who wanted an acting career and a rich Daddy. Considering the fact that she was an adopted child I do not believe that she appreciated Joan Crawford as a mother or anything else. She was a self made woman. She deserves credit.,Positive

"I just watched the my first episode of Kitchen Impossible and Robert actually made the place worse.  If I was the owner, I would have sued him for putting the final nail in this dated restaurant's coffin.  The decor looked cheap and very unprofessional.  There is no way you can do what he attempts to do in 48 hours and in this case he proved that right.  Having said that the owner of the restaurant gets what he deserves if he trusted this guy in the first place.At least when Gordon Ramsey takes on a restaurant he gives them a professional remodel not a cheap job that will probably fall apart in less than a month.  It's just totally reckless the way they slapped this place together.  My bet is that most of it is destroyed by now.He was right about one thing.  The chairs looked disgusting.  I would not hire these two so called decorators to do the men's room in the subway.",Negative

"If the creators of Reign intended to make a historical drama with a target audience of teenage girls, then I would consider this pilot moderately succesfull.  If they were hoping to draw in a larger audience than that, then they have failed in a big way. The script for Reign, while tecknicly good, fails to show any real oridganality, and the acting is barely mediocre. The charicters just don't 'feel' mideville-- the young wemen come across like modern chearleaders and the male leads come across like highschool jocks. And the anackronisms! I'm sure that french castles in the fifteen hundreds all had large plate glass windows and that the young wemen wore dresses that would be great for a prom. And was that an asfault pavement I saw?If your looking for Game of Throwns, give this one a pass.",Negative

It is so much fun to watch and see where Shonda Rhimes takes this show. To outlandish places and you do have to leave your logic behind sometimes (like believing that at least 3 people in the government have committed murder).  But it is great to watch and Kerry Washington is FABULOUS,Positive
"I can't quite say why I love this show and really find it more interesting than anything else on television.  Maybe because it is set in my favorite city, Portland, Oregon, or because it has a perfect mix of police procedural, magic, horror, humor,  imagination, romance.  I love the cast, the morphing from human form to monster, and the cleverness involved in changing the Grimm fairy tales and other folk tales to modern form.  I am hooked and can't imagine watching television without this show.  I will be extremely disappointed if it is canceled given the real crap that goes on for seasons and seasons.  This show is a gem among all the rocks that are television programming.I want to add that I do find the subplot regarding the royals and the birth of the new hexenbiest/royal to be fascinating and well acted.  I love Captain Renard, that most elegant police captain/royal.  What is the horrifying event going to be following the Wildesheer attack?  I wonder if the writers have figured it all out yet.",Positive
"Film six unrelated films and film them separately.  Then cross-edit them all with zero continuity or interrelation and you have 360!  The idea is to come full-circle as the title states, but this does not happen here. Most film makers would just say the producers cheated.  The films are not related to each other except at the end, where there is some attempt to correlate crossover. So in watching it, the viewer is constantly wondering when the film is going to make any sense...this never happens, so is disappointing. Filmed in Slovakia, England, France, Vienna and the US we get some international flavor; but this doesn't assist the go-nowhere screenplay or storyline. The weak premise of the film is that opportunities only occur once in a lifetime and so you have to take advantage of them when you can. The screenplay has one basic premise...everyone is with the wrong partner, who they do not love...so it's time to get somebody else! All in all a weak submission, which is more the fault of a non-workable screenplay and storyline than anything else. Just another example of how one weak element in the hundreds it takes to make a film can totally screw the efforts of everyone involved!  Film making is tough!",Negative
"I am a newly stay at home mom who used to be a cook. I love living vicariously through these chefs. It also helps me to invent more yummy things to cook, or just watch while cooking for my family. Super fun to watch and you get some real knowledge about food from around the world, and possibly what to do with it. For any one who loves cooking competitions.",Positive
This show is addicting. I cant get enough of it. I wish that Amazon Prime had more seasons on it however I am glad they had some.,Positive
"It has taken four years but Solomon Kane has finally made its way to the U.S. and the wait was worth it, as this is the best film adaptation yet of a Robert E. Howard character.  Granted, that&#8217;s not saying a whole lot given previous history.  The original 1982 Conan film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was an enjoyable but highly flawed film; it&#8217;s 1984 sequel, the 2011 reboot, and the Kull the Conqueror films do not even bear discussion in the equation.Solomon Kane may have been Howard&#8217;s greatest character.  He was certainly the late pulp writer&#8217;s most complex creation.  The Puritan adventurer was more the antithesis of Conan&#8230;a man who avoided violence but was driven by a code of strict moral ethics as opposed to Conan&#8217;s more earthly pursuits of gold, women, and ale.  Michael J. Bassett&#8217;s screenplay is not based on any of Howard&#8217;s original stories although bits and pieces are cobbled from several such as &#8220;The Moon of Skulls&#8221;, and &#8220;Blades of the Brotherhood&#8221;.While Howard never wrote Kane an origin story per se, Bassett provides his vision of Kane&#8217;s backstory.  We first meet Kane (Purefoy) in North Africa (where Howard based many of the original Kane tales) as a ruthless pirate leading his men against an Ottoman fortress.  While searching the castle for plunder, Kane encounters a hooded demon known as the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Reaper&#8221; who tells Kane his soul is doomed to Hell for his past evils.  Kane escapes the demon and we next meet him years later having found sanctuary in an English monastery.After a prophetic dream, the Abbot tells Kane he must leave to find atonement for his sins.  His travels eventually lead him to meet a Puritan family called the Crowthorns including father William (Postlethewaite), mother Katherine (Krige) daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood), along with their two sons.  While Kane is scouting ahead, the family is attacked by the corrupted soldiers of a Malachi, an evil sorcerer, Kane  The soldiers kill the Crownthorn men and kidnap Meredith.  Kane has sworn to never kill again but he is forced to break his vow to battle the evil stalking the land and rescue Meredith.Solomon Kane had less than half the budget ($40 million) versus the 2011 Conan the Barbarian film ($90 million) but you certainly cannot tell.  This is a film that uses every dime to its fullest.  It captures the bleak look of England in the early 1600s that matches the essence of the Robert E. Howard stories.  It&#8217;s dark, gray, and barren and seemingly lacking in hope and happiness.Bassett&#8217;s story overreaches somewhat by trying to be too epic in scale. The final battle against the giant fire demon (which looks way too much like a Balrog) came off as self-indulgent.  Howard&#8217;s Kane stories were decidedly smaller and regional in scale.  Kane&#8217;s stories were often personal, however, and Bassett&#8217;s screenplay does have that feel.  Kane isn&#8217;t concerned with saving the kingdom.  He only wants to fulfill his vow to the dying William Crowthorn and save his daughter.  You must credit Bassett for delivering an R rated film that seethes with the savage violence of the source material.  Heads and limbs are cleaved with regularity and without apology.Unlike Howard&#8217;s muscle-bound Conan and Kull, Kane was always described as lean but wiry. Purefoy absolutely nails Kane in every way possible.  Sure the costume department did their job with Kane&#8217;s traditional slouched hat, dark cloak, rapier, dirk, and pistols, but credit Purefoy for making Kane real.  From his voice, to his emotions and to his mannerisms, he IS Solomon Kane.  While Purefoy is outstanding in the lead role he is bolstered by an outstanding supporting cast including Postlethwaite, Krige, Jason Flemying, and Max Von Sydow (who ironically had a bit role in the 1982 Conan film) as Kane&#8217;s father.The Solomon Kane film was released in the UK in 2009 and even though it seemed to be on the literal slow boat, it has finally made its way to U.S. shores and Howard fans can finally rejoice!Blu-Ray ExtrasAudio Commentary with Michael J.

"""Ong Bak 2"" is a very misleading title. The film stars Tony Jaa of ""Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior,"" but ""Ong Bak 2"" is not a sequel. ""Ong Bak 2"" follows a totally different story with different characters and is set in different time. (Perhaps the only element that these two films have in common is a huge statue.) But be assured, Tony Jaa remains the same, as powerful and strong as ever, though you may not like some part of his new film, as I will explain later.Set in the 15th century Thailand, ""Ong Bak 2"" follows the story of Tien, a courageous young boy caught by a slave trader. Young Tien is in fact a prince whose parents have been murdered by a traitor. To survive and get revenge, he joins a group of bandits ""Garuda's Wing"" led by Chernang (Sorapong Chatree) and learns various fighting skills among them. After hard training, grown up Tien (Tony Jaa) is appointed as commander of the group.Tony Jaa's martial arts actions themselves are as amazing as ever, something that will never disappoint. For the new film Tony Jaa employs a wide variety of martial arts styles, plus many kinds of unique weapons such as nunchucks. Though some fight scenes are slightly repetitious, they remain thrilling throughout. Dan Chupong (""Born to Fight"") briefly appears as ""Crow Ghost"" and they provide an impressive battle scene at the climax. As to the acting, well, Tony Jaa is OK (a little too intense at times) and Sorapong Chatree steals every scene he is in.What is really regrettable is that the film considerably changed its narrative style from the original ""Ong Bak,"" in which a simple storyline really worked. Though ""Ong Bak 2"" (co-directed by Tony Jaa, later with Panna Rittikrai, Jaa's mentor and choreographer for the first ""Ong Bak"" and ""The Protector"") has a lot of thrilling hard-hitting actions and incredible stunts (one involving running elephants), its revenge story, which should be simple and straightforward, is a bit too complicated and serious with a twist which I think is unnecessary. Also, the film ends rather abruptly, which is disappointing, but maybe I should wait for the next ""Ong Bak"" film.Obviously ""Ong Bak 2"" has better production designs and costumes than the first installment, but what we really need is Tony Jaa and his actions. Certainly ""Ong Bak 2"" gives it, but not in the most effective way.",Negative
"I was very satisfied with this one and it held up in a primetime hour slot.  The movie uses a minimalist approach: nothing fancy, ordinary settings, characters, and life situations (not including the supernatural element here). The effect is a realistic one, despite the implausibility of the supernatural plotline, I felt like I was peeping in on someone's life. There were hardly any effects. Don't expect a demonic possession hissyfit, a poltergeist tantrum or anything of that sort. Overall, I imagine the budget on this one was low, but the production values do not reflect that. Camera work was fine. Some of the cinematography was great, the area where the cave was. The actors were excellent, especially the parents. They were both believable and entertaining. Their kids, a daughter freshly entering puberty, and a slightly younger son, were good as well, though for most of the film they were, errhhh, don't want to spoil, not acting themselves. But its not a histrionic &#34;not acting themselves&#34;. You will see what I mean. The other, few characters that appear along the way, are creepy, weird, or convey a sense of dread or foreboding, that sustains the atmosphere of dread, a proper horror atmosphere, throughout the film. Its more of an atmospheric film than a visceral shock fest. The story is different (hooray!) and you don't really see this type of horror scenario play out often. The ending is unsentimental, like I like 'em. An adult's horror film, despite the inclusion of children and the family in crisis as the protagonists. Once again, it proves to be true, that the only place for kids in horror, mature horror, is in the antagonist seat (excepting for rare exceptions), No PG13ified cornfest here. Highly recommended for the horror junkie. Thanks filmmakers!",Positive
Great storyline that is full of surprises. Writing at its best. Great acting. This show portrays the human spirit and what it can accomplish when people come together.,Positive
"I really enjoyed this rather violent show. I wouldn't reccommend it for any type of young audience but it's refreshing to take a dramatic look at the Northmen and a little taste of their history. Acting is great, costumes; wonderful, scenery; awesome.",Positive
"My husband and I are probably in the minority, but we loved this show the most of everything Amazon offered. The music was simply amazing. Seeing the always wonderful Malcolm McDowell and Bernadette Peters together was genius and hysterically funny. The young flutist at the end, after a crazy night of drinking and playing (literally), with her haunting perfect pitch, nearly heart breaking music behind the curtain thinking she had missed her chance and WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE IT GOES! This was literally laugh out loud funny, mixed with gorgeous music - you are C.R.A.Z.Y. if you don't continue this gem!",Positive
"We started watching this show only because it was FREE for Amazon Prime members.  I had not heard of it before seeing it on Amazon.  I was very surprised to find it's a great show.  Even my husband enjoys it and I looked at it as a 'chick flick'.  This show revolves around a Vegas show girl who is getting too old for the stage.  There was a man who always stopped to see her when he was in town.  (Hubble) who is madly in love with her.  She ends up, in a moment of weakness she marries this man and he takes her home with him to a town called Paradise.  His mother lives with him, which he never mentioned.  She was a dancer also in her day and as a means of support she has a dance studio where she teaches teenage girls ballet.  The two lead women work well together and they are both quick witted, which lends some comedy to the show.  I highly recommend you check this show out.  I think you will not be sorry.  Hopefully this show is picked up for a second season.",Positive
"""Centurion"" is what is called a ""hack and slash"" film from Neil Marshall, director of ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""The Descent,"" which means there are lots of gores, mutilated limbs and dead bodies. Blending raw violence and beautiful landscapes, ""Centurion"" has a potential for a sweeping saga with action, history and romance, but somehow the film itself, though it is not bad, ends up with dissatisfaction because of the generic storytelling and flat characters.Set in the second century Britain, a band of Roman soldiers is left behind the enemy lines after the surprise attack from the Pictish warriors. Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender), who had survived the Pictish raid on the Roman frontier fort, is entrusted by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) of the Ninth Legion with the task of bringing the six survivors back to safety.Michael Fassbender is as brilliant as ever though his heroic character (and the romantic subplot) is underwritten. Olga Kurylenko appears as a fearsome warrior riding on a horse (and she doesn't speak a single word). She is not bad, but those who expect her to play another sexy ""Bond Girl"" as in ""Quantum of Solace"" might be disappointed.For me, the biggest problem with the film is that though ""Centurion"" delivers a few thrilling action scenes, the story itself is not that thrilling. We see a group of characters chased by another group of characters, but the chase scenes drag on, are at times repetitious, sometimes even look as if borrowed from somewhere else, like ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""""Centurion"" is a blood-soaked period action that could have been better with fleshed-out characters and a tighter story.",Negative
This season proved to have more complications and sit on the edge of your seat action.  Really got into it this season!,Positive

love these shows. too bad amazon no longer has food network stuff on prime. we cut the cable and i rely on these shows,Positive
I don't get it. This show reminds me of gumby and pokey from the 60's. I didn't want to get it just from the illustration but my grandson wanted to see it so I bought 2 episodes. He is 3 and likes it. I won't buy anymore because I think it is too mind numing. It only gets 3 stars because he loves it. Must be an acquired taste.,Negative

"The only good thing about this film is some of the death sequences, but this one is totally different from the previous two REC films. The other two were some of the best foreign films I had seen but this one is too campy and cheesy acting by some of the performers. Skip it and just stick with the first two.",Negative

Timothy Olyphant is the reason I watch this show.  He is such a great actor and I can't wait to see the ending season.,Positive
"Like most schoolkids, I learned history via the &#34;factoid&#34; approach.  I have really enjoyed these documentaries for the chance to put together in my mind the broader issues going on in society at the time.  They are still, of course, a mere glimpse into the lives of these powerful people, but I have learned so much.",Positive
This has the a chance to be a great series. It has a great start of something very different and new that could be great if the show is continued with more of the same thrilling new ideas.,Positive
"I like this TV show but it does get a little old watching David's character as an overly sexual playboy who keeps up the bad habits. I'm wondering when they will introduce the episode where he catches HIV at some point. I have watched a few old girlfriends from San Francisco die because of guys like his character.  Anyway, its entertaining. Also, the male behavior in the TV show reminds of the lifestyle and mentality of a lot of men in L.A. and San Francisco which is interesting, BUT it does get old too. Its like...really??? Gross! Grow Up!",Negative
"I am truly facinated by this TV show.  I have all 3 seasons and can now watch each one, uninterruped by commercials.  It's so amazing how they plan each caper.",Positive
"On this series, I think I'm getting my money's worth.Episodes for the most part are entertaining.I'm not a big fan of &#34;humiliating the character&#34; type humor, so knocking a star off for some of that.And it seems like the female cast continue to get more and more snarky ( *itchy) as time progresses.But overall a good comedic experience.",Positive
"There are enough similarities between The 100 andBattlestar Galactica: The Complete Series(BSG) that it merits a comparison. Indeed, The 100 even brought over a couple of BSG actors: Alessandro Juliani (Lt. Gaeta), Kate Vernon (Ellen Tigh), and Hiro Kanagawa (as Cyrus Xander in Caprica). Before BSG fans cry bloody murder, let me provide a caveat: BSG was a 5-star masterpiece, and The 100 can't touch it. But both serials are post-apocalyptic and portray the struggle of the remainder of humanity being stuck in space with limited resources and a ticking clock; furthermore, The 100 uses similar camerawork, ambience, and post-production color grading. However, the target demographic is quite different, and this has a negative impact. But don't give up if you dislike the first episode... it does get better, despite persistent flaws. Things start to get pretty wild in Episode 9.PROs+ Groovy cast+ Compelling storyline that keeps you coming back+ Occasional unexpected plot twists+ Eliza Taylor excels in her role as Clarke Griffin+ Isn't afraid to present provocative ethical/ philosophical questions (along with the mindless entertainment)+ RENEWED for a 2nd season, so no worries about being left hanging at the end of s1CONs- too many plot aspects simply just don't add up... this is mainly what separates The 100 from 5-star sci-fi productions- emotional and intellectual capacity feels constrained, as if the producers figure the intended YA demographic can't handle more- the pop music that crops up in too many scenes is unnecessary and obnoxious (although they tone it down in later eps)And a bunch of unanswered questions, including (but not limited to):- Why did the folks on the space station have so many kids? (lack of birth control? whatever the case, they surely should have had enough foresight to prevent overpopulation)- The alpha male character (of the 100 sent to Earth) becomes and stays a dictator?- What is up with the giant snake and 2-headed wildlife? Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Chernobyl didn't create giant or two-headed animals, and evolution takes millennia. While huge snakes can be found today in tropical regions, The 100 is set in a temperate climate, like Canada (it was shot in British Columbia). Not to mention, Octavia walked away from her snake encounter how?- How did youths who had previously never held a gun become sharpshooters (Episode 9) overnight?",Negative
"Great DVD for any true American Dad fan! This DVD includes all of the episodes in American Dad season 4. The episodes are uncensored, which makes the viewing experience that much better! Great DVD, lots of jokes and laughs and a perfect gift! Zero complaints, watching the episodes never gets old!",Positive
"Everyone I've ever known swears and/or cusses, but there's a time and place for everything, and I'm of the opinion that not ALL of our publicly elected officials swear.The zany antics of our legislatures isn't even funny, much less have an ounce of realism.  A lot of production personnel and audience members may be jaded in that they don't believe that the trust of public office is deserving of some reverence, but I do.If this was based on something substantiated, then yes, I might go for it.  But the premise of the show is that the representatives put on a show for show's sake, and everyone, even their constituents, are in on the gag.  If that's the case, then why bother with elections and this show at all?It's one thing to mock the political system, and it's one thing to throw up caricatures, but this goes well beyond that, and just trashes the whole thing with teenage humor for what used to be the adult time frame and career.I'm really sick and tired of these shows.  No, I didn't watch the whole thing, and I further believe that all they do is foster more of the same.  I wish people would tune out this kind of trash.I wouldn't back this thing, even if I had all the money in the world.",Negative
I like all the actor's in this series. Like others have said there is nothing new here.I think they all do a great job and the most interesting character of all is Edgar without him I don't think this series would fly at all.,Negative
Top notch shows with excellent acting and superb special effects. We enjoy watching and rewatching each one of these specials.,Positive
Nice to see  New show about sports. I can see females watching this if they like to laugh and like football.,Positive
I like shows about how people will ban together when faced with conflict.Will be disappointing if the story doesn't follow through.,Positive
"When all they do is make shows about politics it gets really boring really fast! They need to focus on relationships more. The political agendas get pushed so hard it's tedious to watch! Also the guardian angel was a total joke! They should have brought back Fred!  He was the best! Her new angel was annoying and was always trying to get attention by not having clothes on, ok we get it already you think your hot get over yourself!!! SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTING!!!",Negative
"I was reviewing another horror comedy and reference this one in my 3 ''liked horror comedies"". I mean real horror comedies, not horror movies that sometimes make you laugh. That would be Dale & Tucker vs. Evil, Stitches, and this one. So, I figured why not bop on over to this one and cast my vote for ""success"".This one is over the top funny, with no believabiltiy to it but the actors all sold it. If someone were telling me the film, blow by blow, I'd be rolling my eyes, gagging and retching, and doubled over in pain. I would never believe that I'd actually like it. So, give it a chance. I don't think you'll be sorry (if you have a funny bone).",Positive
"The pace ... omg ... slow, slow, slow, glacially slow...soporific.  And the images ... a naked woman in a bed of black satin sheets ... one drop of blood?  Please -- every lame vampire book on the market has that one on the cover.  Lots of  talk about sex and death and the psyche.  Most of which is silly and lame.  Pretentious.  Dull.  Not worth a penny.  I hope all of the characters find a creative way to eat each other until all of them are dead.",Negative
I was captivated and my interest kept on.  I am looking forward to the new season and hope it is available soon.,Positive
"If this were produced, I think I'd watch it, but I wasn't all that impressed with it. I really like the United States of Tara, but this one looks just okay.",Negative
My grandkids love watching this on the Kindle.  It's wonderful to get an entire season of episodes for them to enjoy.  Robot Rampage is their favorite.,Positive
"While he doesn't eat body parts he does enjoy a good Chianti. An arch criminal tutoring a naif-savant graduate profiler in the most spectacular crimes we never imagined. James Spader snaps right into the role of genius amoral master criminal. His unique more- erudite -than- thou precise speech mannerisms make the character mesmerizingly repellant. He really delivers this role. Well written, well acted but he is both icing and cake. Balanced by the achingly ethical straight out of school FBI profiler and her relationship with her feminist husband/ it's marathon material folks",Positive
"Nature vs. Nurture, are we who our parents made us to be? Has our culture molded our beliefs that could easily change if we grew up learning the opposite perspective? I enjoyed this documentary because I have always been a very open minded person and that was instilled in me by my family. We are all born the same but the experiences and courses our lives take are pre-determined by the society and culture we grow up in. What do we do when we realize our dogmas need to change?",Positive
"As historical fiction and as adventure drama, the show is terrific. The acting and the production values are both superior to the writing, however, which is too bad. For others who have seen the show, how do you suppose the vikings knew when it was noon at sea?  :)",Positive
"This show is about a large close-knit extended family constantly spending time together and dealing with the crisis's of everyday life, and absolutely NOBODY can keep a secret.  They mostly seem to be in hectic stress mode and the show is highly emotional.  BUT you like these characters and invest in them quickly and are thus willing and eager to share their joy and pain and all the garbage that is part of life.  There are also some good examples of a good marriage in this show - which is GREAT as so few of us get good role models there in real life.Craig T. Nelson is the father of 2 sons and 2 daughters, and he and his wife are hiding marital problems from their kids. The eldest son has a wife, a teenage daughter and a young son with Asperger syndrome (sort of a high functioning autism) and is highly depended upon by everyone to be ""the fixer"" in every situation, the other son is single and something of a commitment phobe who just discovered he has a 5-yr old son he never knew about (who by the way is a really adorable kid), Lauren Graham plays the older daughter who at age 38 returns home to live with her parents and start life over after having divorced her musician/junkie husband - with 2 semi-delinquent teenage kids in tow (a son and a daughter), and the other daughter is a lawyer trying to squeeze in some ""mom"" time with her daughter and her husband is the perfect handsome who gave up contracting/construction work to be a perfect stay-at-home dad to their little girl.The whole cast is fantastic and the show absolutely holds your attention. (And I am thankful to have another series to watch the incredible Lauren Graham in!)I didn't get to see this show on TV, so I was thrilled to be able to watch it on Amazon Prime (pretty much back to back and minus commercials!)  This show is a great dramatic series!",Positive
"I love the first  preview of the after ,kept me on the edge of my seat ,can't wait for the season.",Positive
I very much enjoyed this series.  I enjoyed the female lead.  A no nonsense sort of woman.  Very intelligent portrayal.,Positive
"When is the beginning of the ending of life? We need to be able to accept a reality that has been imposed by the ability to prolong life. What can be done as opposed to what should be done . . . what qualities of life are a part of this balance? An exceptionally well presented documentary that poses a simple question that has too many answers. What is a 'good death?' Is the concern for the patient or the patient's family?  Physicians, surgeons, patients, and families are faced with having to find an answer within a myriad of complexities. To find answers, all aspects of a patient's care are taken into consideration because the answer is an 'unknown.' This has become a dilemma  within modern medicine. There isn't a single equation that can be used to determine treatment vs. no treatment. This presentation may be helpful in allowing one to make their own decision. The information is accurate and not over dramatized. Listen carefully and understand the responsibility that we can choose for ourselves without leaving the responsibility for that decision to another. Decades of experience have allowed me to make an informed decision. I have made a choice so that others are not forced to make a decision for me.",Positive
"We are watching this again, something we almost never do, because the writing, the acting...you miss so much the first time. This is easily the best written show on TV, and the acting is superb!",Positive
"It's hard for a TV series to establish itself when it is trying to pack everything in less than an hour plus is trying to shine when it is in the shadow of movies like Ironman, Avengers, and the others.  But Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is doing it.We all expected the same levels that the movies delivered, but TV is different.  And they had to establish a new cast but stay within the boundaries of Marvel, the movies, and plans for future movies.  Not an easy task.But the characters are growing.  The plots are drawing us in.  We are finding out things that were only hinted at, but those lead to other hints, other mysteries.Of all the shows this season, new and old, this is the one I anxiously wait for the next episode.  This is the one I will make sure I see.  And this is the one I watch multiple times.  Thank goodness for Amazon Instant Video because if I had to wait until it was released on DVD to own I don't know if my nerves could handle it.",Positive
"it is good, but the &#34;Juliet-no memory of Nick&#34; plot line lingers too long and the Capt Renard reveal & Juliet accepting of Wesen plots are settled too quickly. Again, it is the secondary characters; Monroe, Rosalee, & Bud (also Sgt Wu) - who really give the show heart and fun. I am glad it got a Season 3, hopefully the can either focus on the arching storyline or monster of the week plots, because that format will quickly get old (see X-files,et al). I like to see they go into the other characters, mainly the wesen friends to see how they deal with the day to day, keeping their society a secret, and interplay between different wesen communities.",Negative
"This is a comic book characiture but rings true as an iconic hero for the ages.Great Log Line: ""A ruthless mercenary renounces violence after learning his soul is bound for hell. When a young girl is kidnapped and her family slain by a sorcerer's murderous cult, he is forced to fight and seek his redemption slaying evil.""That says it all.James Purefoy resembles Hugh Jackman quite a bit and is almost as good.Superior casting, acting, cgi, action, direction and cinematography. This is a truly mythic character---not highly developed here, but brilliant on the part of the creator; truely great. Needs development....I really wanted to see Rachel Hurd-Woodf naked; maybe innocently walking into a cold river to bathe. She has got a grreat looking rack, under all that virginal linen (I can tell), and our hero needs more motivation than just the fact she made him a frigging shirt!!A very good movie; see it!.",Positive
This might not be the most profound program on TV but it certainly brings back great memories. Who doesn't love to hate JR? Sad to see Larry Hagman pass.,Positive
"I just love this character, Raylon and all the characters of Harlan County. I would love to see he and Wynona back together with their new baby girl. But that would wrap it up too sweetly for this dark series about the drug buying, selling and using in the back country of Kentucky. There is a lot of killing so don't let your kids watch, and the sweet prostitute Ellie Mae who seems to continue to get away with her life and pulls at our heart strings along the way. She is too dumb to be conniving....ever hear of an &#34;innocent&#34; prostitute?I am just starting Season 5 and hoping it will be better than it has started out.",Positive
"My wife & I remember this series when it was on TV, but we did not pay it much attention. The teen-love-triangle-high-school-drama had been playing itself too much. However, recently, while being on bed rest for a few weeks & coincidentally seeing the new movie previews; I was intrigued by the hype. Then I decided to give it a try. (We are Amazon Prime Members & I saw it each time I logged in to watch a streaming show) It was better than we expected! It genuinely delivered - Veronica (Kristen Bell) sublimating her grief & pain into finding her best friends murderer, while helping her dad & fellow high school students with individualized cases - after they had all abandoned her due to the events of her father, then the sherif of Neptune, suffering at the hands of the wealthy, powerful parents. The stories, the filming, the writing was very good! We were completely addicted to the show and watched it until it came to the final episode. Yes, it had it's cheese & some Episodes did not quite hold true; it was still a very good series, launched many young Hollywood actors & actresses as well as showing up some faces of previous young Hollywood actors/actresses now playing adult parents to this generation. We will be seeing the movie this weekend-now that I'm off bed rest! (Can one be a Marshmellow in post-haste?)",Positive
yay so great unbelievable so very happy i like it hell i love it hell its great  and wowee woohoo,Positive
I liked all of the characters except the conductor. He seemed (and this may be the writing) too much of a stock character. Yuck. It has potential though.,Negative
"I have followed the life of a lot of designers and was impressed the way they made the movie of my famous designer Versace, thank you so much. I learned a life from the story.",Positive
I just loved this series from start to finish. What a great series. I think they probably ended it at the right time too. It had run it's natural course.,Positive
"I love the show, but am royally angry that they chare tha same price for info commercials about th show. I want that money back. That's insane.",Positive
"Timothy Olyphant is awesome.  The way he plays a deputy marshall just makes the show.  All the plots, intrigue, and life altering events happen to him just because.  He handles every situation equally with no prejudice.  Sort of like a mid life crisis gone astray. . .",Positive
"This is the first scripted drama for the History Channel and it's a perfect fit for them.  It's a great story with beautiful scenery.  Give it a try, even if you're not a fan of viking history it's a great watch.",Positive
Not the warm and fuzzy kind of show.  But it still had a decent plot and was entertaining for a couple of hours.,Negative
"I have watched since it began, season one episode one.  Connie Britton has always been one of my very favorites.",Positive
"It's as realistic as I've seen. I was in Law Enforcement over 30 yrs, 26 yrs as dispatcher. It's an adrenaline rush one minute & quiet for a little while.",Positive
This season featured some longer shows . These were well done with very interesting plots with a fine cast of actors.,Positive
"There are much better reviews on here that I intend to write, so if you want spoilers, look there.Being anti-Wall Street, and with an innate hatred for the bankers who get away with it all the time, I tried to sympathize with the Detective who felt the same. Why I couldn't genuinely root for the good guys, I can't say. That's the effect the movie had on me, and the main character.",Positive
"I found this show by accident and was drawn in immediately.  The story grabs you, the characters are diverse and intriguing.",Positive
"I  dont get it... people keep talking smack about 'Defiance&#34; and &#34;Falling Skies&#34; but this stuff they like...Stuff like this is just way too unpredictable for me, including the action sequences...how come in every American movie the Americans always come on top unscathed?? this is not reality... lame...and even when its not a Us vs. Russia, its might be good guy vs. bad guy, the good guy always wins...boring.. predictable.. I need something with a little more imagination, like &#34;Defiance&#34;, or even &#34;Haven&#34;You people are slow, and have no imagination, seriously..I'd rather have sci fi",Positive
"""Eddie doesn't rob banks...He's about this high in the bunch but he gets around more than any man I've ever seen,"" says Dave Foley (Richard Jordan), a baby-faced Boston cop about as amoral as the wiseguys he hunts. Eddie Coyle (Robert Mitchum) is a worn out, two-bit gunrunner. He provides untraceable revolvers when required. He draws the line at machine guns. Eddie is honorable in his way. He loves his family. He's just a low life who isn't all that shrewd. The fix he's in, because he can't take any more jail time, is what this superb Peter Yates' movie is all about.""Look. I'm gettin' old, y'hear?"" Eddie tells a young hood who deals in machine guns. ""I spend most of my life hangin' around crummy joints with the punks drinkin' the beer, eatin' the hash an' hot dogs and watchin' the other people go off to Florida while I'm sweatin' how I'm goin' to pay the plumber. I done time when I stood up but I can't take no more chances. Next time it's goin' to be me goin' to Florida."" Now he's facing more prison time for foolishly agreeing to drive a getaway car when he should have asked his friends some questions. He'll do just about anything to cut a deal for no jail time. He's nearly 50. He doesn't want his wife to go on welfare, doesn't want his three kids made fun of because their old man is doing time. He's squeezed by Dave Foley to inform...and Eddie decides he'll rat a little. He's too believing to understand he might be tagged for ratting big time. It's all betrayal, but Eddie doesn't really understand betrayal. All those friends of Eddie's make us wary every time we meet them: Scalise (Alex Rocco), who robs banks, sometimes violently; Jackie (Steve Keats), the dangerous dealer in stolen machine guns; Dillon (Peter Boyle), owner of a low-life bar who knows more about things than Eddie does.The movie looks as hopeless as the Boston weather. It's the cold end of fall, filled with drab, chill days where parking lot asphalt is always wet. We're into Eddie's life in the low lane, where the anchors in the crummy strip malls are a tired Woolworth's and Barbo's Furniture Store. It's a lousy life and it belongs to Eddie Coyle. ""Have a nice day.""Director Peter Yates sets up scenes -- an exchange of machine guns, a bank robbery, a family held hostage, a stakeout in a commuter train lot, a night on the town -- that are so naturally established that we might miss how skillfully they build the story and show us Eddie's life. We're never sure if things are as hopeless for Eddie as they seem. Yates keeps us on edge, and he adds layers of Eddie Coyle's sad and foolish trust.This is one of Robert Mitchum's best performances. Mitchum still looks like he might be a tough guy, but his Eddie Coyle is a man who has had the force of his life wrung out of him. He's been in the life forever. He does the jobs others ask him to. He doesn't ask very many questions. He's just not smart enough. Mitchum takes all the hard edges off his usual persona and gives us an aging loser whose life is on the skids, and who doesn't understand just how badly off he is.The Criterion release looks just fine. There is a commentary by Peter Yates.",Positive
I'm so excited to see where Jax is taking the club and Kurt Sutter is always working to amaze the audience.,Positive
"I watched the first episode, I like the scenery and being in a different country. I just have not had the motivation to go further with this show. It is not terrible like say Sleepy Hollow, and it is far from great like Sopranos. I think if it was free I would watch it more.. Just did not grab me enough to spend some money on more episodes",Negative
"Rarely does a film, much less a tv show, come up with a hero who is equally matched by the villain of the piece.  Even better, neither of them is wholly heroic or wholly villainous, just like most real people. Thus, our hero,Raylan (Timothy Olyphant), the US Marshall, has a perfect foil, Boyd (Walton Goggins). Both of them come from former A+ shows in which they were not the leads. TO had a big role in DEADWOOD and WG had a big role in THE SHIELD.This episode opens the fourth season of this wonderful show and immediately you are thrown into authentic America. The virtue of setting this in Harlan, Kentucky is that this is an area of the country which has not become the same as everywhere else.  These people stick close to their roots.  They all know one another and the backwoods of Kentucky. They were all seemingly born with a gun in their hands and some criminality in their genes. They have their own dialect and if you talk like they do in NYC or LA, you will stick out like a Martian here.This episode has all the great quirks we've grown to love in this show: a guy in a bear suit with a local prostitute, a criminal in Raylan's trunk, then his car gets stolen, Boyd contending with one of his drug dealers who has gotten caught up in revivalist religion, and Raylan's venomous father, now in prison, who seems to have secreted things in the walls of his house.This show appears on virtually every top ten list which is posted online and deservedly so.",Positive
This is a really great series. The bears are friendly and each episode has friendly lessons about sharing and caring. My 3 year olds love it.,Positive
"This show is just freakin' hilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will make you laugh out loud! If you're looking for a new comedy show to watch, you won't be disappointed with this. And yes, men like this show too, it's not all girlie with Jess being the main character. The guys add a whole other dimension to the show!",Positive
"Casting, writing, excellent.  Worried the stories might not be as driven with the tensions between Beckett and Castle resolved, but still loving their love story.",Positive
"I enjoyed this series due to the action and the characters. High tech doesn't solve everything. And humans can survive without high tech as well. Defending yourself requires firearms whether you like them or not, for you will only die tired if your only solution is to run and hide.I am looking forward in the comtinuing segments!",Positive
"Each story is interesting and it is Jane that adds the delightful flavoring to each show.  Simon Baker (Jane) is a totally charming and captivating &#34;crime consultant&#34; with his metaphysical leanings and interpretations for each case.  The ambiance of  &#34;The Mentalist&#34; is qwerky in a delightful way...Jane's car, his vests and his couch.  The story for each episode is well written and the acting by each member of the cast is great.",Positive
"This is a very good series about the Cold War during the 1980's. It is very graphic in some areas, but it is a intense program!",Positive
"I was a huge fan of Bones when it originally aired.  I've read the books this series is based upon, I work with ""squints"" and I thought the writing was spot on, especially the cultural conflict between the scientists and the ordinary joe, i.e., Booth. The original seasons creatively worked through those conflicts and demonstrated how a team can be formed from this kind of diversity.  However, this season has become a characture of that original season.  The characters who had grown are regressing.  Bones is becoming every negative quality that can occur with an over inflated ego and it is not pleasant to watch.  She's superior, hypercompetitive and she doesn't seem to realize that everyone has both strengths and weaknesses -- including her.  If the writing doesn't somehow curb this trend I won't want to be around her and I sure won't tune in to watch.",Negative
"The opening left me cold.  I was not interested at all in the movie until Blue started giving the back history of her childhood.  Little by little, I was reeled in and by the end, really enjoying the movie despite the story board shots.  That being said, I think this would make a much better TV series than a movie.",Positive
Loved the romance and drama too. Love movies from way back in 1900&#34;s.  Make more!  Put more on Prime too.,Positive
"Hilarious.  Absolutely.  Yes, it does make fun of a particular extremely conservative political party but ... how I can explain it -- the very things that they vote for (or against) are the very things that are funny when you tap into the real motivations behind their votes.  I always read the Negative Reviews and if you're completely pro-that way, you're not going to like this.  Fair warning, so don't watch.  For everyone else, this is very funny and you will enjoy.  I'm excited to recommend this to all Jon Stewart fans and speaking of JS -- I'm thrilled Amazon is now offering the Daily Show.",Positive
"This was cute, and funny, and smarter than I'd expected.  I hope the premise of the show--that she improves her life--holds over romantic entanglements.  Kelly is a likable character.",Positive
"This is my second time watching season II of BSG...I cried. After Sharon was saved by Tyrol and Aggethon and she pulled the blanket over her head and cried, I cried also. This show is unbelievable and sooooooooo good. When was Cdr Adama made an Admiral! This show made me change my mind on interrogating prisoners, especially women. I know I will get slammed for this, but I don't care. I'm a woman first and foremost, and above all is. This show speaks to so much.",Positive
I probably shouldn't like this show so much.  Archer is so wrong it's right.  Hopefully you are not easily offended.,Positive
"This is a beginning of telling the REAL American history and more shows should be produced and shown in the truth (good and bad) of our history.  Such as the story of two riders Paul Revere and the OTHER and the 7 Black members of the Founding Fathers, as well as the first Speaker of the House of Representatives.  I could go on and on but the telling of our REAL history in such media and entertaining could be very beneficial.",Positive
I really like the series. The writing is still really good. I would recommend Grimm to anyone who is a fan of shows like Once Upon a Time. The show is one of my favorites.,Positive
"A terrific series continued, too bad this is the end.  We have really enjoyed the &#34;Robinhood-ish&#34; stories of Leverage. All the characters are so unique and yet work well with each other in the storyline.",Positive
Fun little movie that you used to be able to find on regular television in the past. Grandchildren enjoy it and learn from it.,Positive
"Am totally enjoying this series.  And I have to pay per episode for it, since Amazon Prime's not yet available in my country of residence. Amazing how fascinating Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes continues to be",Positive
"Interesting view on positive psychology, but I would have liked it to be longer and more detailed. I'm biased though as I am a therapist and have spent a significant amount of time studying the topic.",Positive
My roommates and I used to take an entire weekend to watch the entire mini-series. Very well done and perhaps my favorite Ms Bennett and Mr Darcy since Garson and Olivier.,Positive
My husband watches this he bought the last series and will watch in January when it comes on TV he loved it.,Positive
"I had a 8,9&2 year old watch this tv show. They were glued to it the whole time. I think it's above my 2 year old but the older seemed to like it.",Positive
one of the best sitcoms I've seen recently. sure don't know why it was cancelled with that great cast.,Positive
"It's a funny idea that gets in it's own way many times. If the Producers and director had just let the characters tell the story rather than trying to direct it into a story it would have been a lot better. The possibilities for this movie were endless, but someone decided to force it into a box instead. Maybe someone can remake it into a real comedy some day.",Negative
"The show is based on Sherlock Holmes and his side kick Watson. Watson is now Joan instead of James played well by Lucy Liu and instead of London it is set in New York. It took me a while to get to like this Sherlock actor, Johnny Lee Miller especially after the tour de force Robert Downy, Jr performance in his two Holmes films. Slowly, his take on Sherlock has made the Conan Doyle character more sympathetic and likeable than any version I had seen played. Rounding out the actors are Aiden Quinn and Jon Michael Hill who are Holmes' police friends for whom he and Joan Watson provide consultation.Coming to the show late and having the luxury to see the first season without commercials the refining of the characters is easily definable. Season 2 is continuing the same improving and refining progression as Season 1 only with better antagonists. This show is well worth your time.",Positive
"Music. Where would life be with out music? Music can change dark into light. This is what this series does for me. It makes mesmile and dance. As the actors change, I do not feel the same about the characters. They are every bit as talented, and then Ithink it really is the music. That is what brings me back to this series again and again.",Positive
"OUR FAMILY HAD REALLY COME TO LIKE THIS SHOW,  SO GLAD ITS OUT ON DVD, SO WE CAN WATCH AGAIN",Positive
The funniest show out right now in my opinion.  Great show to watch with the family and really depicts how different the &#34;modern family&#34; is from what it used to be.,Positive
"Loser. Expected something better from Whedon. Big fan of Firefly, the best tv series ever. Think he is desperate or strung out on drugs. Don't waste your time and money here.",Negative
"ONE GREAT THING IS THAT THIS IS NOT A &#34;FOUND FOOTAGE&#34; MOVIE!Filmed with grayscale effect and at some scenes it will go into full colour. Yes, it will go into full colour especially on those scenes that has upper body nudity. In terms of demon characteristics of the characters, I find it weird how a succubus is portrayed in the film. Succubus does not make a dead person comes alive!Exorcism does not work as it is portrayed in the movie. Demons don't die. It can only be banished. And you have to make the demon tell you its name to banish it.The following are what I found good in the movie:-Audio overlay throughout the movie-Yay! Not one of those handheld camera movies :DThe following are what I found to be no good in the movie:-How the story escalated-Lack of research regarding demons and spirits-Sexual scenes are the &#34;honey trap&#34; of the movie; you don't need those scenes in a good horror movie!-Please stick to one video format; either grayscale or colour but not both!",Negative
"I enjoyed this series spin off from The Closer. The ensemble cast worked well together and the abandoned boy side story was nice to see, made them all more human.",Positive
...the ladies of &#34;Hot in Cleveland&#34; do it again!  Season 4 is just as funny and hilarious as Seasons 1-3.  The comic timing of all four of these gifted actresses is perfect.  Their talent is what makes this show so watchable and enjoyable.  Looking forward to Season 5 on Prime!,Positive
My husband and I have seen all 3 seasons of Suits. The show is really entertaining and great to watch. We can't wait for the start of Season 4!,Positive
We love this series.  Informative and funny. Love the interaction between the generations who work together. Chumlee is a hoot!,Positive
This was as good as season 1!!! I snoozed a bit in season 7 yet this one i couldn't put down. Great. Just great! Episode 17 broke my heart. I thought they did a great job with this season and the final episode. It is on the edge of your seat kinda season.  It was a great show if tears come up when it's about to be over.,Positive
"This is a pretty decent pilot.  Something interesting and it kept my interest.  The acting was pretty decent and there are known actors in the series.  If they do it right this will be an awesome show.  If they do it wrong, it will suck.",Positive
Like the books.  Only complaint is there are only 3 in the series.  The characters are interesting and complex with much more to be explored.,Positive
"heroes, sylar, science fiction, science fiction tv, season 3, zachary quinto, powers, marvel comics, hero",Positive
"very,very funny show.  the first season was great and the best.  not so interesing this year, so I always rerun the first season shows",Positive
"This spinoff of The Closer is better in many ways, but I still recommend folks watch The Closer first since most of the characters are the same in Major Crimes and watchers of Major Crimes will get a better idea of the character history if they watch The Closer FIRST.Where Major Crimes differs from The Closer is they have introduced a fabulous storyline involving a teenage boy who is a witness to a crime.  The storyline evolves and the end result is it gives more heart and sole to this program than its predecessor, The Closer.  There are times I am just in tears on how well Graham Patrick Martin portrays &#34;Rusty&#34; in this program because it is such a fantastic performance.  Quite frankly, this character carries the show!Many spinoff shows, quite frankly, aren't as good as the predecessor (or suck altogether), but Major Crimes really surprised me!",Positive
"Inescapable is a ride to a happy ending that usually does not happen to many, who have left Syria.  Most are executed and forgotten that is so sad that we live in a world that is so destructive of their own people.  To them I salute them for the acting in this movie, as well as the story that says so much about Syria and what is truly like over there.  Great actors Alexander Siddig, Joshua Jackson and Maria Tomei they did wonderful job of showing the movie audience what Syria is really like today.  I rented this movie and it was well worth watching, as I hope others will.  Learn from this movie to see what so many go through in other countries.Here is the link for all of you to enjoy a wonderful movie -B00BL0LZL6",Positive
"Based on a lot of the reviews that are already posted here, I don't think there are a whole lot of people calling it like it is. So, I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3. There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who aren't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV, not a single one, that my wife and I don't flock to week to week, other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception. As the 3rd season played out, we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season, all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger. A serial rapist. A murder on campus. All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then, when the show started back up, all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes. The following episodes were, for lack of better words, UNEVENTFUL. All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending. What did they do? What happened? Did the writers lose interest? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes? This is what I think. Personally, I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them. So, they in turn, gave up on the CW.All speculation aside, VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season. The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact, but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it's 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts. The ratings that they're suffering aren't because of quality of show, but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies... like the big boys do... cause we're watching... and unfortunately, we're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore.",Negative
"This movie was great.  Even though you know where this movie is going to end up, it's still a great flick.  Plenty of stuff to make your skin crawl.  You end up playing the game with the characters in the movie.  Fun to watch.",Positive
My kids ages 8-11 thought it was cute but too young for them. They would like to see some harder mysteries or different math problems.  They didn't think Victor vector was a realistic villain.  But they did want to know if there were more episodes.,Negative
This is the best show we have seen in a long time.  We watched all of the seasons and were sorry when we finished them.  We can't wait for the new season to start in June.,Positive
"A must see!!  These guys are great and so funny.  If you haven't seen the show, you really should take a peek, you'll love it.",Positive
"I began watching this pilot by myself and felt that it might be lacking something. But then my 3-year-old son began watching it with me, and he was fascinated. We are always looking for new shows that involve interesting characters who explore and learn, and I think we would watch this on a regular basis.",Positive
"this is a grand series and you just know the dastardly brother is going to have his way.... you can't believe his wife is actually his wife, the characters all play out very nicely against each other and the duality of the life of the servants and the lives of the hotel owners is fantastic",Positive
I enjoy watching Tosh.0 but the first season just didn't have very good material. His later seasons get much funnier.,Negative
We like that there is a complete story in each episode versus the soap opera approach. There is continuity of the situation- relationships etc. but the crime has a beginning and a solution.  The technology may be bit in the future for some of the modeling but it is fascinating and the range of roles and situations are intriguing. the personalities keep you interested.,Positive
"Quentin Dupieux's RUBBER is many things: existential horror comedy, commentary on the filmmaker/audience relationship, obscure dream-like ode to non-sequiturs.  It's a rather straightforward story--tire malevolently comes to life, ignorantly (perhaps) kills everything in its path--framed by a Greek-like movie-watching chorus and a wise-cracking, fourth-wall-breaking sheriff (who encourages one of his deputies to shoot him to prove that nothing is real).  And, as you may expect, none of it really makes sense.The acting is solid, but ultimately inconsequential--which is perhaps the film's biggest flaw.  When your star is a mute piece of rubber, you need solid directing and interesting visuals to keep the audience's attention.  Initially, Dupieux delivers; the open scene is beautifully orchestrated, and there are other killer (pun intended) scenes as well.  But it doesn't really add up.  Which is largely Dupieux's point, of course; he's making a statement here.  The problem is, his message doesn't come across too clear.  RUBBER is worth a watch for fans of off-kilter comedy, or anyone interested in the philosophy of film-making, but it isn't a movie for everyone.  If the title of this review (quoted from that marvelous opening scene) appeals to the film aesthete in you, then this movie is definitely up your alley.  If it seems like nonsense...best look elsewhere.",Negative
"Great show from start to finish. The main character really takes her audience for a ride, when she bends her enemies to her kneeswith no mercy to give. The story takes place with a woman, takes revenge on a group of people who killed her father and each one of these villain turn in ex villain, when she takes her revenge on the people that hurt her and her father.",Positive
it's got a lote going 4 it. cursing very tasteless humor. it's a more human swing of parts 4 dave compared to moulder . puss the most important to me NAKED LADIES and a few big named stares. only thing missing is graphic violence,Positive
"Okay, let me see if I can guess the inspiration for this show.  Producer finds himself at a classical music concert and starts fantasizing about the orchestra (particularly the hot ones) and thinks ""man, I bet those stiffs are party animals offstage, whoa.... I should totally make a show about snobby, artsy-fartsy musicians acting like out-of-control high-school students"".  Now for the title: if we say ""Shostakovich in the Jungle"" nobody's gonna have a clue what we're talking about and if you go with Handel most peeps only know one of his pieces (which would totally send the wrong message); ""Immortal Beloved"" definitely made Beethoven seem kinda sexy, maybe a little angry but hey.... what about that 80's romantic fantasy ""Amadeus"".... ya, that's the ticket.So what's in a name?  Well, I hate to sound like a wet blanket but just maybe the creators of this show should've tried reading the lyrics to one of the composer's greatest works (Requiem in D Minor) before they associated his name with recreational sex, chemical dependency and towering ego's devoid of any respect for either the music they're playing or the people they're playing it with.  :(",Negative
"I wanted to enjoy the show. However, I'm tired of the negative stereotypes of black players (drugs, partying, daddy issues, reliant on white people to make their lives better) BS. Whether this show gets picked up or not, I will not be watching.",Negative
My three year old daughter LOVES these guys and has now for the past year.  Teaches her quite a bit about animals.,Positive
The show throws everything scary  it can at you -except clowns and ventriloquist dummies. Honestly- alien abduction/serial killer with mommy issues/ evil nazi doing human experiments/ zombie like creatures/ crazy people/ nuns/ killer in santa costume /demonic possession.  Seriously- what saved it from being a ridiculous mess was the cast.,Negative
"We like anything with a paranormal twist but we were unable to get into this show.  For one thing, it's British and the British seem to have a different way of presenting plots.  This show is also geared towards young people and we are older than dirt.",Negative
"i wanted to see how it all ended, but certainly the earlier volumes were better. not sure if the writers changed or what happened.",Positive
"So interesting to learn the show is based on actual documented information from the London Hospital during that period. The stories will leave you gasping at how sickness was dealt with back then. The cast is great of course, and the show fantastically done",Positive
"Has many flaws in my opinion that make it not worth the money.  If it were free, okay.  The best way to describe what I disliked about this movie is to ask the question, &#34;Why would you put your tongue on a buzz saw to see if the blade is turning?&#34;  That does not happen in this movie, but if it had--maybe the movie would have been better.",Negative
Great actors gave brand new characters depth in just 30 minutes. Would love to see this picked up as a series.,Positive
"This is the first reality show I have sat down and watched and fell ga ga over !  I love this show maybe cuz , I grew up with 5 brothers of my own.  I get it.",Positive
"This movie was a lot better than I expected. It was well made for a direct-to-video movie. It was funny, cheesy, corny and that's what made it so awesome. Alex the exterminator is about to have a bad day when he must go head-to-head with an enormous black widow spider who eats and kills anyone that gets in her way. Alex teams up with a Mexican security guard and together they try to kill the spider by any means necessary. I highly recommend BIG ASS SPIDER!!!",Positive
and should not be on tv. There is little redeeming value to this -only shock value. Swamp people is better,Negative
"If the cleverness and suspense of season 2 could have been sustained, I could watch Nikita forever.  Season 3 was still fun but the stories got more and more outlandish.  The dead were alive, those living were probably replacements for the (presumed) dead, and several people were really someone else all along.Of course, it was all wildly implausible from the start.  But there were times, like when Nikita broke lose from her chains and took on an entire room of Division personnel or Percy's final showdown, that were quite intense.  Alex getting her first apartment and boyfriend were good, too.  And, of course the arms dealer who was dead for quite a while before returning alive.So farewell, Seymour who's not really Seymour, Owen who's not really Owen, Amanda who is Helen and Alex whose real name is Alex but she's someone else.  It was great fun but I think it was time.",Positive
Another sports-centric show--yawn.  This didnt grab me and when it was over I had no interest in seeing more.  Natalie Zea won me over but the rest of the cast got lost in unfamiliar-faceville.,Negative
"I got hooked on this show last year and did a marathon of all six seasons.  I don't get cable at my house so I was able to watch the first five seasons for free using my Amazon Prime account, but I couldn't wait until the sixth season was free on Prime so I paid for it.  Fantastic storylines, characters and acting.",Positive
"Generally great writing and acting, and some fun sci-fi.Some episodes are better than others, but overall, this is a highlight of my week.",Positive
"Yes I enjoyed the first season of this show, that I thought was a summer fill in.  I was happy to suspend my disbelief in the fantasy premise of a boutique practice in the Hamptons. By the last show of the season the scripts had become boiler plates with fill in the blanks for the next show. The characters were one dimensional pulled out of a royalty free store for characters.  Credit is due to the strength of the cast. All are engaging and held my interest enough to watch through the end of the season. They all had the chops to make a cardboard character look like more than than it really was. In spite of the efforts of the cast this show was too thin for me to watch a second season",Negative
The first season was great and then each season got better and better.  Where do they find those great writers?,Positive
"THIS SHOW IS SO WELL WRITTEN AND CAST, PLEASE PLEASE DON'T RUIN IT LIKE SOPRANO'S RUN, LET IT KEEP PLAYING SEASON AFTER SEASON MR SUTTER I KNOW YOU CAN KEEP IT GOING, AT LEAST A FEW MORE YEARS 10 OR SO,  SO LITTLE QUALITY WRITTEN AND ON TV THESE DAYS..HERE'S TO DON'T LET IT END!!!GREAT JOB CAST AND CREW AND CREATORS AND WRITERS ETC..",Positive
"New characters, a ton of fun. Killing me that Tyler is gone, Matt Donovan not getting as much time as he deserves.Brilliant double double doubles, showing off Nina Dobrev's and Paul Wesley's subtle range. lol. With half the cast cut off to a new show,  I hope all the actors are getting paid double for their double roles, hahaha. Waiting for more from the newest evil professor Dr. Max.",Positive
This show is very interesting...great compilations of extreme cases. I definitely recommend this show for anyone with interest in the criminolgy field.,Positive
"I read the books so I will give the season a chance. My wife, however, is done. She fell asleep about half way in and I don't blame her. If I hadn't read the books I wouldn't watch it. How can they F this up, seriously? The actors are sooooooo boring and dull (except for the excellent old hunter and the Wishmaster (whom they already killed)). It seemed like 80% of this episode was exposition about personal relations. I pray to God they use practical effects instead of just CGI (unlikely) because the &#34;monster&#34; looked like it was the same one from about 100 other CGI ghost/monster movies. The minute CGI shows up it disconnects me from the story; it looks cartoonish.I had high hopes, so heres praying they turn it around and make it exciting.Seriously, when they were showing the teasers for the series,  they had one with just shadows, a tapping cane, and little candies being tossed, along with some music, that GAVE ME CHILLS! That creepy feeling/terror is the atmosphere they need to find again.",Negative
"This is good TV at its best. The plot is smart and keeps you on the edge every episode and along the season. The characters are riveting. The acting and the dialogues tone-perfect and intriguing. It is a story of spies based on compelling intrigues, not on gadgetry and suspension of disbelief. It is a family drama based on great writing, great scenery, great actors. It is a story of loves than cannot happen or cannot be expressed. It is stoic and serious and fascinating and even fun in its own way.",Positive
"Great, loved it. The whole cast. Each character had his own set of problems. John Goodman was excellent. The idea of 4 politicians living in the same house together makes for some very funny ideas. Hope this show doesn't go the way of so many good shows, the way of the DoDo bird.",Positive
"Upfront, I'll admit I'm no fan of the late Elmore Leonard.  Never liked his books, or for that matter screen adaptions based on them.  I ""love"" Carla Gugino, but hated ""Karen Cisco"" for example.  He's in the same boat as Carl Hiaasen I think, quirky, weird, and largely unreadable (""Get Shorty"", please!).  I'm a U. Miami grad and lived in South Fla. for 4 years but while I'll agree it's different, it ain't as different as Leonard and Hiaasen see it.That's why ""Justified"" has come as a surprise.  Of course, it has going for it the compelling performance of Timothy Olyphant in the lead as Marshal Raylan Givens.  Olyphant was incredible in ""Deadwood"" and has brought his interpretation of a lawman into the current century with equal aplomb.  When you add in the superb acting of Walton Goggins as nemesis Boyd Crowder you have a winning recipe for one very entertaining program.  Goggin's turn as flawed cop Shane Vendrell in ""The Shield"" remains one of the most impressive performances in a drama you are going to see on the small screen.  This is a program for adults; so that means there is adult language, there is violence but it is not gratuitous nor excessive.  The showrunners pack a ton of story in each episode so you'd best be paying attention.  Supporting cast is excellent and help to balance some of the excess of the leads- truly a collaborative effort.  I don't have cable, but prefer to purchase DVD's of shows that interest me when they come out; we are waiting patiently for Season 4's release so we can enjoy another visit to Harlan County and the world of Raylan Givens as envisioned by Elmore Leonard.  Definitely recommend.",Positive
Saw the series on tv a few years back and decided we'd forgotten and missed enough episodes to re-watch the series.,Negative
"The plot is great, the characters are well written and acted. Certainly if you liked Season 1, you'll like season 2 even better. But opinions will vary obviously and vastly. Either you'll love the show, or you will watch something else. I'll also take a quick moment to rate Amazon Prime delivery of the content ( FLAWLESS ).",Positive
"Very annoying startup.  The trailer in the beginning cannot be skipped.  Put your DVD in and go get your popcorn, drinks, etc.",Negative
"I was not sure how I'd feel about this show- so I approached it with skepticism, but it's really come through. The writing and acting and story are all very interesting and not super predictable. It's also shot and scored very well.",Positive
This is a lean adventure film with a measured pace set in the rarely seen Tasmania starring the ageless and ever worth-watchingWilliem Dafoe and supported by a group of able real-life-looking actors.  It is satisfying to watch a well-thought-through film with a good story and A not disappointing ending these days.  If you are not expecting an action adventure but a drama with a good theme then you will not be disappointed.  I would rate it 3 1/2 stars.,Positive
Very exciting.  Great characters and actors that you care about.,Positive
"The first thing you'll notice is that SGU is trying to capitalize on the success of BSG: the camera work is similar, the atmosphere equally grim, and the recipe laced with a dash of sex. Luckily they also copied BSG's inclusion of philosophical debates (whether spoken or inferred) and the grand social experiments that spring out of one of sci-fi's oldest scenarios: people being stuck in space with each other. You'll also notice that they are playing around with flashbacks; many shows do this, but i got a distinct impression early on that they were trying to mimic LOST. Sometimes it works, other times it's just distracting.Although ""military sci-fi"" is my least favorite subgenre of space shows, i have loyally watched every episode of Stargate since 1997. SGU breathes new life into the franchise - Atlantis was starting to get repetitive and i was basically only tuning in to experience the witty, whiny sarcasm of David Hewlett. SGU not only displays some talent in acting, but also a few new ideas in plot that were not explored in Stargate shows previously.SGU was struggling to find its footing in the first half of the season, and it suffered from some particularly boring plots, such as one horrible episode that was the equivalent of having a wasp stuck in your house and trying to chase it out a window. Yet my perseverance in watching has finally paid off in the 2nd half of the season. The story arc is finally developing nicely, including a new group of aliens who lack the cheese factor of SG-1's Goa'uld and so far have proven more mysterious than the Wraith.One thing that annoys the hell out of me is random inclusion of songs in the eps that i guess are supposed to be part of the narration or something but bomb the mood instead of affirming it. I mean the emo or whatever type of crap music they use is not as much of a disaster as if they woulda spliced a rap song into the footage, but they really screwed up bigtime by including music with lyrics. Obviously someone on the production team wanted to be trendy and/or include their favorite artists: this indulgence should not have been permitted.Anyway, the plot possibilities are almost limitless, and I think SGU has potential to pull off some great story arcs and keep the generally smart tone of the show without the trappings of its predecessors. Let's hope they keep moving in the direction that the 2nd half of s01 turned towards.",Positive
"I think they did a decent job with this show. The Green Arrow was not always the top pick for DC Comics fans, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the show based around this character. Hope this does well and hope to see more like this in the future. Very entertaining.",Positive
"As a longtime Ciaran Hinds fan, as well as one who relishes crime dramas that shed light on the workings of tortured minds (e.g.,Law & Order Criminal Intent), I could overlook the shortcomings of the first two-part episode (Anna's wobbly spike heels, the short skirt, the misty eyed but knowing looks, her thoroughly unprofessional demeanor, etc.), and gave it a rave review based on the strength of the final interrogation scene, dynamite, she showed what she's made of, mettle-wise, matching the perp in intensity.  His crimes made sense, though there were gruesome details galore, they struck me as realistic, not gratuitous or designed merely to shock.  I also liked the promise of the attraction between the two leads, where would it lead?  Then I watched ""seasons"" 2 and 3.Gratuitous, preposterous.  So many gaffes, overlooked leads and details, FOR EXAMPLE, ***SPOILER ALERT*** in Season 3, they did NO background check on the perp's brother (!), and they only thought to check on the whereabouts of the perp's son at the last minute- gosh, he might have gone there!  And no reporting of the knowledge of the plane, no typing in of the plane's serial number to see what/where it might be, absurd.  The final scene wherein Ciaran and Kelly abandon the car and RUN down the runway after the plane was one of the stupidest scenes EVER.  MANY plot points are left totally unexplained.  It's as though through some printing mishap every other page of the script failed to print and nobody noticed.RE: Season 2, if you thrive on the lurid and the depths of human depravity, much the same way horror fans watch zombies eating people's brains with glee, this may be your cup of tea, though I'm sure you'd like a story that makes SENSE as well.  ***BIG TIME SPOILER ALERT*** A father who not only commits the most gruesome of murders, but forces one victim to eat excrement before dismembering her, also sexually tortures his son and daughters, operates on and removes his daughter's reproductive organs, for FUN.  I couldn't overlook such blatant gratuitousness in any case, but there might have been SOME justification if we gained an understanding of such depravity, or the dynamics of the coppers' interpersonal relationships, or what makes the characters tick, but no such luck.  The leads and the other officers evince one-dimensional, erratic behavior that made NO sense.SO many errors, ludicrous; for example, one of the daughters assaults detectives on two separate occasions, drawing blood, and no-one says a word (they don't even fight back, one just slinks away)!  They don't arrest people for assaulting police officers in the UK?  Also, they had the perpetrator's voice on tape (I think, or SHOULD have taped his calls), early on could've matched the voice prints, AS WELL AS eyewitness identification of him, yet they don't arrest him, simply learn more appalling details with each visit then go back to the squad room and look at the horrific crime scene photos again.  When they finally do detain him, they sit him in an easy chair and serve him lunch, and, SURPRISE, he escapes.  And a detective sleeping with a reporter, ""accidentally"" affording him access to her case notes?  And with no repercussions?  COME ON.  Columbo or Inspector Morse this ain't.  Real UK cops must've had a field day with this twaddle.  I admit I was curious to see if things might improve in the final installment, but it's not a Prime offering so that sealed the deal.For lurid and close to the bone that DOES make sense, (to me, anyway), seeSingle Handed: Natural Justice, a VERY dark (and profane, be forewarned), but superb Irish series available on Instant Video.  And BOTH seasons are free to Prime members.",Negative
"When we watch this show, both kids have a blast, and I notice that it teaches kindness, gentleness, and assuming positive intentions. This is wonderful for kiddos. I love it because it's got good values woven through and my kids love it. Plus the length of programs is just right at about 15 min.",Positive
There's nothing like sitting down to watch this show.  Doctor Who continues to keep this crowd entertained.  BBC has done an outstanding job casting and producing this show!!,Positive
Beautiful dancing along w/ realistic and often heart-wrenching glimpses of young students as they strive to do their best while maneuvering through varying emotional crisis.,Positive
I like historical drama that take place in England.  I always learn something new.  I would recommend this drama if you like that time in history.,Positive
"As anyone can tell you, comedies are a tough sell, especially when broaching such subject matter as the end of mankind.  Some wouldn't dare find anything close to that a laughing matter, but when it's used merely as a backdrop for broader, more general comedy, it certainly can be a nice filter.  That's exactly what writer/director Todd Berger set out to do with IT'S A DISASTER: he combined an end-of-the-world scenario and mashed it up with a twentysomething and thirtysomethings coming-of-age comedy (THE BIG CHILL meets PERFECT SENSE.  On many counts, it just doesn't quite work; yet, there's something wonderfully sublime about seeing a bunch of self-centered shallow suburbanites get their comeuppance ... even if that comeuppance is a nerve-gas Apocalypse.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Emma (played by the comely Erinn Hayes) and Pete (Blaise Miller) Mandrake throw only the best Sunday brunches.  Yet this week's brunch is going to be a disaster.  Not only are they in the midst of their own full-blown marital crisis, but also some terrorists are about to detonate a series of nerve gas canisters across the United States, bringing about an end to life as we know it.  Will the quiche be too hot?  Will everyone like the wine?  Will they have to down it all before the end comes?  Oh, what's a couple of yuppies to do!Surprisingly, I thought IT'S A DISASTER missed more than a few of its marks.  That isn't to say that it's unfunny in any way, because that would be inaccurate.  It's just that, given the premise and the cast - including David Cross, Julia Stiles, America Ferrara, and more - I think I expected a bit more.  Many moments felt like they should've been played a bit bigger - a big more obtuse - and, instead, they're scaled back almost to the point that one wonders if everyone showed up knowing their lines.  Or was this a case of dialogue being manufactured on the set, and the players were only provided with the talking points?  It's hard to say, though I'd be remiss if I didn't underscore a bit of disappointment.There are some truly brilliant pieces in here.  Berger himself dons a hazmat suit and shows up uninvited to the dinner party as snooping neighbor, Hal; he's the one that breaks the news about the attacks.  Rachel Boston and Kevin M. Brennan are splendid as Lexi and Buck Kivel (respectively), a husband-and-wife team so completely comfortable with their own generous sexuality they want to share it with anyone they can (which almost includes David Cross's Glen in a wacky development).  And the occasional still shot of the dead latecomers to the party on the front steps - along with an assortment of dead crows - is increasingly funny as it's played so wondrously deadpan.  I can't help but wonder if IT'S A DISASTER started out as a stage play - all of the action takes place inside the house, though spread out across several rooms - but I've no doubt thinking that this is exactly the kind of film that when it gets remade will probably find a much bigger and much more appreciative audience.It's definitely worth a view.  Maybe not an owner.  But definitely worth a view.IT'S A DISASTER is produced by Vacationeer Productions, Attainment Media Group, ARM Entertainment (II), Gordon Bijelonic / Datari Turner Films, and Tip-Top Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled through Oscilloscope Laboratories.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds very solid, though there were a few instances when recording levels seemed a bit off.  Fans will be surprised to find a wealth of special features, including a commentary track and even a Comic-Con Panel appearance.  It's a nice assortment for a nice middle-of-the-road comedy.RECOMMENDED.  It's more benign comedy than it is outright farce, and, as a consequence, IT'S A DISASTER misses some of the true laughs because so much of it is underplayed.  Still, there's an awful lot of talent in there, so much so that I would've expected better.  This may've been the case of a writer/director being too close to the material to see the weaknesses in the performances; it could've used a few more manic highpoints - especially given the subject matter - and a little less routine shtick of twentysomethings trying to figure out who they are.  It's the apocalypse, after all?  Laugh it up, people!",Negative
"This show, which never was more nor less than a silly drama set in a swank, sweet location, has slid off to the side.  Season 4 lacked the bite it found in earlier seasons.  But all is not lost.  Once a fan... still worth watching.",Negative
"Enjoyed this story!  Can't wait to watch season 2!  Interesting story line.  I wish some of the costumes covered a little more, but besides that, I really looked forward to watching it!",Positive
It had some drama but not as much as i wouldve hoped to see.......... dont know exactly why that is. hmmm?.. Anyways umm this season jackie actually makes me kind of like her... surprisingly she was not so bad this season. Malaysia hmmmm i dont know whats with her this season i think she over analyzes things too much and then everything just goes awry. Draya surprised me! So kudos to draya for finally not looking like a punk. But at the same time draya pissed me off with her arrogance like hunny its not that serious tune it down babes........ your cute but its not that serious mama. The other cast mates were alright............ I dont know this season just was a little too short and not enough action. But it was ok,Negative
"~Sadly, many will consider this is true history but it's not!It's pathetic what is put into gullible minds as fact when the actual history is so much more interesting.Queen Mary was a Caucasian with red/auburn hair. That is an important part of true history because when the executor overheads her he had no ideal by that time in her life she was wearing a wig & when he went to hold up her severed head for the crowd her head fell out & he was left holding the red wig.Also, the good-looking Prince/king was no were near being the stud portrayed. Facts are he was very slight in size, had a deformity, & was always sickly.It's no wonder our children (USA) are so behind in school compared to so many other countries watching this FICTION believing it's true.Had this been a show with fictional characters I would have enjoyed it.",Negative
if you are reading this review you already know what the show is about in season three is no disappointment. Definitely worthwhile and worth the money,Positive
Second season while still dark (seldom anything ever going their way) they still manage to survive.  I'm sure anyone that watched this would have liked to see at least one more show (someone should make a movie) to show them making it back home.,Positive
"I love the music, the characters, the writing, and the cast. They are incredibly talented young actors, and the show continues to please!",Positive
Enjoyed this show! It was intense with good action. This episode left me with anticipation for the next week episode.,Positive
"Cyberpunk nerd that I am, I'm going to try really hard to like 'Almost Human'. Karl Urban has real potential for the ragged, neo-noir detective role, and if they maintain a high standard of writing, and stick with solid story and character development instead of defaulting to the usual tropes and CGI flash, this could be a real winner along the lines of BSG and Fringe.",Positive
Wonderful show if you are an adolescent. If not then find something else to watch. The concept is funny but the show is not.,Negative
"Figure skating always bored me to tears.  Then along came Tonya Harding and her band of hooligans and sweet mother have mercy....Solid doc that held my interest.  It's not a particularly original approach to this sort of filmmaking.  There's lots of talking heads and the story line is essentially linear.  But who cares???  When a story is this fascinating you don't have to use parlor tricks to hold my attention!  I didn't know all the details as I've never been much of a tabloid reader, nor did I ever really stop to consider how strange the sport of figure skating really is.  All in all, it was  fascinating film from start to finish and my wife and were both left scratching our heads and disagreeing with each other about Tonya's indictment.  Definitely worth my 3 bucks.",Negative
"I enjoy watching these kind of series on BBC, and I especially like Charles Dickens' books so this is a win win for me. This series is very well done and the characters are well played.",Positive
"I had never watched Suits, that is until six days ago. I logged in to Amazon Prime and saw that I could watch the first two seasons for free with my membership, and I was hooked!",Positive
"Great SHOW!!! Need more episodes! I really love this show, and so too does my husband...we are awaiting more episodes!!!",Positive
I love this show they raise a lot of interesting question you should check it out you will be amazed at what they talk about and the evidence they provide,Positive
Not your ordinary movie.  It tells a story and portrays the difficulty of life for those who do not travel the traditional path of the 9 to 5 working life.,Positive
"In part this is... the typical cop show (Dirty Harry, Elementary, etc.) where the &#34;stand-out&#34; star detective works outside the rules and gets away with things that his peers wouldn't. The other part is... also a bit deeper in building and weaving side-plots that run throughout the series. Lastly, the first and last episode really bookend the series content. I plan to watch season 2.",Positive
I have enjoyed watching this series on Prime.  It is so good to be able to watch these shows on my Kindle or laptop.,Positive
I love this series and do not want it to end!  I sort of use it as a reward for finishing my goal for the day!,Positive
"I missed this series the first time around, watching one or two episodes.I'm wading through all the episodes on my Kindle Fire and enjoy the dramatic and, sometimes, comedic plots of this interesting show. The characters are a pleasure to watch and the show was very well produced. And the commercials......don't miss those at all.",Positive
I really enjoyed watching these episodes. Comedians stopping by and saying &#34;wow this is what happened to me and guess what I it kind of funny because I look at everything as being a little humorous.,Positive
I am not a cook but the talent wow.  This is a must if you do like to cook or just eat.  This is a show to show peaple working under stress and using talents.  There is much to learn and you will love every min. of it.,Positive
"WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST NEW SHOW THIS SEASON THE COLD WAR WAS NEVER SO HOT KERRI RUSSEL IN HER MOST MEMORABLE ROLE SINCE FELICITY AMAZING STUNNING THE STORY LINE AND PLOTS DON'T FAIL TO DELIVER  AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE RICHARD THOMAS BACK ON SERIES TV ALTOUGH IT'S A FAR CRY FROM JOHN-BOY WALTON , GREAT SHOW DON'T MISS IT",Positive
See I really liked and got the whole point of Drive. I really did enjoy the film this though on the other hand I hated with a passion which is the directors follow up film. Literally the movie makes no sense to me except that Gosling's brother gets killed by a crazy vigilante type cop because his brother is doing some very bad things ( oh ya and to mention everyone in this movie is not likeable and I could not stand any of them. They are all psychos and what not). So gosling takes it upon himself to seek out some revenge. I mean you can watch this movie but it is complete garbage but once again that is just one persons opinion. To me a very big disappointing movie because I wanted to like it but hated it instead.,Negative
Was a different kind of humor and I guess some people didn't understand it ... but I did and it was refreshing.  Love how the kids loved the one teacher who was having a hard time &#34;finding herself&#34; ... I really liked her myself ... and helped her alot as she helped them ... sorry to see the series end and not be picked up for further stories ... I was looking forward to it continuing.,Positive
i absolutely love this show.it is very entertaining . just can't wait for the next episode. now i have to wait for another season,Positive
Plot dragged on quite a bit. The plot didn't explain how the Councilman got the whole town to so &#34;dociley&#34; go along with his hanging scheme.  I didn't like that ending at all.  The whole plot seemed to revolve around the Councilman's personality and evil lying.  A bit unreal and a bit boring.,Positive
Wasn't sure at 1st. about this series but I soon became hooked. The characters take awhile to unfold & you begin to see how things are not what they seem.,Positive
"This second season is exploring new ways and avenues where bones are of course multiplying at leisure and for our best pleasure. Yet this second season is quite new in several aspects.First and foremost the season is widely open to personal matters and it explores the private, and at times not so private, relations between the members of the team, after the boss has been changed to a woman, which rebalances the sexual ratios. Bones herself is courting and going out with an FBI agent who has temporarily replaced Booth while he was sort of suspended and deprived of a gun after shooting a clown on top of an ice-cream vendor's van. But in the end she will not go through the process completely as far as leaving the Jeffersonian for a life of full leisure and farniente.Zack manages to get his doctorate and to be hired in the job he was holding as an intern because he goes to Angela and begs for help on his  look and manages to become presentable, which means he can now stand in court and testify seriously in a deportment that can carry the agreement of the jury. So far he is no longer obsessed by sexuality but he encounters a great difficulty: he is summoned by the White House to go to Iraq. But this time this reference does not lead to any political dissertation or even cogitation on the subject. Political questions are systematically and carefully avoided in this second season.Jack and Angela are finally realizing they love each other and even decide to get married and they finally find themselves in front of a priest (in fact a black priestess) in some church for the last step when the State Department steps in and reveals Angela is already married in some kind of broom stick over-jumping ceremony. More later, I guess.Booth is entangled in the hands of a British shrink after his shooting the clown on the ice-cream vendor's van and he is a perfect sucker, building a full barbecue for the shrink under the shrink's blackmailing procedure of retaining the document he must sign. This same shrink will also step into Bones' psyche as some kind of private counselor. Agent Booth and Doctor Brennan will not be able to establish some kind of personal relationship, especially since Temperance's father reappears in her life and even saves the situation a couple of times. But he has to be arrested by Booth and be brought to court for his ancient crimes, including the attack against the deputy chief of the FBI, though this one was crooked to the utmost, his lips kissing the heels of his shoes or something like that.Booth reestablishes for a short while a relationship with the new boss of the institute, Dr Camille Saroyan, with whom he had had a liaison some time ago in another life. But that cannot last more than one or two episodes. This is characteristic of all these people: they are unable psychologically or administratively to build balanced and normal relationships. Is it a side effect of their jobs or professions, we can wonder, or simply  personal immaturity?That level of the season blurs out the various crimes and cases they examine and solve. And these cases do not deal with political issues or even with immigration, except one case about some strange Chinese practice of burying the bones of a man with the bones of a woman so that the man has some company on the other side of the road. Most cases are plain simple crimes in America and among Americans. But they often deals with social problems like the mother of a severely handicapped girl: what can the mother do to help her child the genetic victim of a deadly disease that keeps her retarded, even if it is only for a short time before she dies? Some of these questions are crucial: do we have the right to experiment on human beings new treatments that would enable astronauts to reinforce their bones that get highly decalcified due to prolonged sojourn in space?Some of the cases are plain vicious crimes and it is fun to catch the killers who are most of the time not at all the one or the ones we were expecting. Suspense is always with us even if the personal and more sentimental level of this season makes that suspense not as intense as I would personally prefer it to be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",Positive
"USA Network has got me hooked on so many of their character driven shows - Burn Notice, Psych, White Collar and of course Suits. Gabriel Macht appears as a mild mannered Clark Kent type of guy in his real life appearances but then proves his great acting skills to pull off the character of Harvey Specter. I love the other characters also - Mike, Donna, Rachel, Jessica and of course Louis Litt. I've found myself so many times getting angry at Louis only to end up feeling sorry for the guy.",Positive
3 guys living with girl whom they treat like their little sister even though she is full grown woman and educator of children.  They act a gang of teenagers,Negative
This season was cool. Not better than the first 2 seasons. Kind of slowed down. Still worth getting though. Better than season 4,Positive
"The first half of this film is compelling, well acted and well scripted, all with some first class production design to really bring alive 1970s New York. Kirsten Dunst was exceptional in her role in the movie and brings warmth and depth to the love story and some subtleties to explain why the relationship fails.Unfortunately, once she leaves the story, it falls apart dramatically. Ryan Gosling's character - the protagonist until the mid-point - quickly becomes unlikable and fairly boring. The film then starts to focus on his involvement with a second-tier character that overshadows the real questions raised in the first half. And then there's a really dull trial that provides an excuse for voice-over at the beginning but becomes the focal point at the end.Ultimately the story offers no real insights or answers about a man who destroys the lives of so many around him. It might have been better to drop the ""inspired by true events"" title card in favor of some creative license to offer the audience some sort of satisfaction in the way the events play out. Still, this is not a bad film by any means but by the end it feels like a missed opportunity.",Negative
"Fantastic, Riviting show. I can`t wait to see it every week and when it`s not on for a week or two i actually miss it....ALOT! That may not seem like much to some of you but if you knew me?? Tv shows or movies are not at or close to the top of my list of things to do. The Only shows i can put in this 5 star category over the last decade are The Wire, Sopranos, A certain show about a Motor Cycle Club with a name (Sam Crow) and who in the heck would NOT put Heisenberg in their? He Breaks Bad! Ok, BAD joke!Shows pretty close to the top are Chicago Fire, which is getting better as it goes. It has beautiful shots of a Great City,Lots of drama and some cool relationship stuff among all firefighters. Of Course the US version of Shameless and even Nurse Jackie (most of the time) and early (Much earlier) Weeds was different and cool at points.Other than those....... I dont think i watch TV shows or movies unless they are Documentry type films/shows.",Positive
"This season is really great in terms of developing the big story.  It would be a lame show that introduced a sentient machine and didn't examine what that might mean, but POI is really going the extra mile :)",Positive
"Finally... fans are being treated to Oliver Queen assuming the persona of Green Arrow as opposed to ""the vigilante"", where he spends less time contemplating the meaning of life and more mopping up the streets of Starling City with thugs, villains and riff-raff.Green Arrow's Support Team:  Diggle remains an awesome candidate for the ideal confidante and best friend while Felicity should probably be nominated for ""sweetest character on television"" award.  Thea, Roy and Laurel (looking increasingly skeletal as the season progresses) on the other hand, still give the show bit of a Melrose Place atmosphere but fortunately this is offset by more screen-time for my favorite cop on any series (i.e. recently demoted Detective Lance).  A disappointingly pointless introduction of Summer Glau's hard-edged business mogul gives way to the introduction of a truly menacing, master-villain as well as a new and ridiculously cute Starling City hero; speaking of which, the Barry Allen sub-arc adds the feeling of an expanding DC universe causing a comic nerd such as myself to fantasize on what new directions the show may eventually take.Season 2 showcases some EXCELLENT stand-alone episodes, lots of twists and turns including tons of back-story and even a very surprising, budding romance.  Holy cats does this series ever know how to build suspense.... it has single-handedly brought back cliffhanger endings to television which make one almost insane with anticipation for the following week. :o)",Positive
"I have only seen the one episode so far; however, it did not disappoint. Jim is back and just as awesome as ever.",Positive
This is a very gritty series about building a railroad after the civil war and the trials and tribulations that the workers had to go through.  Lots of little sub-plots throughout that keep things interesting.,Positive
"This has a definite twist in the plot that was unexpected.  Usually, I can anticipate what is gong to happen in a series, but this time I didn't expect the changes in relationships within this season.  It was definitely worth watching.  The biggest compliment I can pay a series is that I will watch it again sometime to see if I missed some small clues that were meaningless the first time i watched it.",Positive
"In an effort to capitalize on the audience from ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" the FX network has tried a number of promising shows. ""Sunny,"" to me, has always been a completely inspired bit of lunacy that defies everything about the age of political correctness in which we find ourselves. It is so wrong--but that's what makes it so right. Unapologetically demented and offensive, the show has moments of brilliance. ""Archer,"" of all the programs that have followed the ""Sunny"" time slot comes the closest to the ribald and irreverent tone and works exceedingly well as a companion piece.""Archer"" is a terrifically entertaining animated piece featuring perhaps the most obnoxious and oblivious central characters you're likely to encounter. Sterling Archer (aka Duchess) is a spy who fulfills every sexist cliche one might expect from a boozy, clueless, womanizing James Bond wannabe! In other words, he is awesome! Voiced impeccably by H. Jon Benjamin, it is sheer madness to follow Archer as he blunders his way through assignments, familial entanglements, and romantic assignations. His flirtations with fellow spy Lana (Aisha Tyler), his rivalry with Lana's new beau Cyril (Chris Parnell), his workplace banter with easy Cheryl and inappropriate Pam (Judy Greer and Amber Nash), and his wonderfully dysfunctional mother love (the incredible Jessica Walter) are juggled nicely amidst a bevy of ""Get Smart"" missions. It's all great, but patently disturbing, fun.Season One represents 10 episodes. Two standouts to me are ""Mole Hunt""--the first episode, and perhaps the funniest, that strikes the perfect balance of wackiness and character introduction--and ""Honeypot"" where Archer must put his life and his body on the line as an irresistible gay boy toy. By all means, check this series out if you like comedy that straddles the line of good taste and then jumps over it! I loved this creation named Archer and his relationship with his mother is one of this great show's true highlights. Benjamin and Walter are a perfect pair! About 4 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 11/10.",Positive
"I loved season 1, 2, and 3 because it was interesting and fast moving.  In season 4 the mystery took over and the (interesting and fast moving) turned into what the heck are they doing.  Come on writers and take us to some realistic flow that made the show so interesting in the first place unless you want this to be the last season.",Positive
twists and turns ....but Zen will always be there stand up and get to the bottom...worth a watch on a weekend with rain,Positive
Don't waste your time on this series.  It's like watching one of the stupid daytime soap operas that never go anywhere.,Negative
"The characters continue to grow and surprise us. Great family fun. Nice to enjoy as a family. My  kids love it, and so do I.",Positive
"I am still a bit confused on this title. Is it a mix of animation and puppets? The puppets were maybe the best, most original part. My 3 year old couldn't figure out that this wasn't Pound Puppies. I think that the character similarities and rough art style in the pilot made it slightly confusing. A different style will help (re: puppets). That being said, they really liked it a lot. I have 3 boys - 10, 5 and 3, and next to Sarah Solves It this was their favorite.Just as an addition from yesterday  we have watched this pilot 5 times now. The 10 year old is a bit over it, but it's not designed for his age group. Yet, even though he says he doesn't want to watch it, he still does. The other 2 are jumping up and down, singing the song and laughing at this point. The only other show to garner this much attention from them was Sarah.",Positive
"...to see Mr White get what he deserves. Although in the first season his bumbling antics may have mad him a somewhat sympathetic character, Vince and Bryan have taken Mr White into some very dark recesses of the human soul, and although I rate this as perhaps the best series I have ever watched, I will be bitterly disappointed if Walter is not dealt a gruesome end. We'll know in a few weeks.",Positive
"There are many inconsistencies with this show, A homicide detective partnered with a coroner? His on again, off again girlfriend goes from being a nurse to the coroner's assistant, and his future partner; officially or not? This show appears to be more of a writing class of don't's than do's. Everything they teach you about writing and storytelling seems to have been thrown out the window with this show. I find myself doing something other than watching. If you're one of those people that likes to have the TV on for company and don't really need to watch it, this show is great for that. SPOILER ALERT; whoever is the least likely killer... did it! And like Clark Kent's glasses, only he and you can see it.",Negative
I am totally in love with some of the family members.  I find it a fun and entertaining show to watch.,Positive
"First of all, if you like action then you will like this Show.This show is not a cheap tv show, the scenes they have and they shot in many different placesthis show got some of the best CGI effects for a tv show meaning special effects...I give this show a 8.5/10 overall...and these are some ways to know if you will like Intelligence.if you liked The Blacklist you will like this show as well.",Positive
"Anymore it seems like it's harder and harder to find shows that you can watch that appeal to audiences of varying ages (adults and children between 2-10).  Duck Dynasty has delivered that for the past 3 seasons and continues now into their 4th.  When we cut the tie to cable/satellite the nicest aspect was being able to buy our favorite shows from Amazon and watch them commercial free and be able to re-watch them from practically any internet connected device.The family dynamic is nice to see and I think the most refreshing aspect, as a viewer, is that while you know that they are all doing exceptionally well... they still appear to be pretty down to earth.  The last thing this world needs is another show about uppity rich people and their spoiled idiot children.  We hope to see at least a few more seasons of the Robertson clan.",Positive
"""Answer Man"" (2008) charmingly and shockingly knocks off the 1997 hit, ""As Good As It Gets"", only Answer Man didn't get any Academy Awards.  Both films feature a quirky, rude, obsessive and reclusive author who hopes for rescue from his pathetic life upon encountering a vulnerable and resilient single mom. The snappy dialogue flows.  Answer Man also lifted the sad, fatherless child, the needy single neighbor who craves emotional and financial support from the recluse, and the long-suffering, devoted agent/assistant . ""Answer Man"" did drop the adorable dog (Verdell in AGAIT) who provided such an ""awww"" factor , and substitutes a puppy-like young friend to prop up the single mom instead of a supportive grandma. The other superficial details don't even matter.  In the end, Jeff Daniels in ""Answer"" and Jack Nicholson in ""As Good"" win the moms(Helen Hunt in AGAIT and Lauren Graham in AM) by protecting their sons, and making BIG gestures to become better men themselves.  I adored AGAIG, and I was perfectly well-entertained by this copycat although amazed that the producers would so boldly rip off such a famous and fabulous original.  In both films, all the actors do their thing excellently, though Nicholson wins the award for making his recluse edgy enough to make you cringe, right up to the moment where he redeems himself with soul-baring honesty.",Positive
"I love River Monsters. This is my most favorite show on TV today. Jeremy Wade is very informative, brave, and crazy. I've learned more about fish on his show than I have over years of watching tons and tons of documentaries. Plus is exciting to watch his journeys and encounters with people.",Positive
"This is what a Recap is suppose to be about, to Re-Capture the events of a program and accurately present them in a fashion that someone that has not seen the full episodes would be thus caught completely up on the happenings of that program. In military and law enforcement it is a called a debrief.The debrief tells those what you know without them having to be there in a way for them to make calculated decisions on what you have told them.This Recap does precisely that. 10+++",Positive
"The Killing is a re-creation of a hit Swedish show and has officially been killed by A.M.C. Again another amazing show gets swept under the rug. Even if you have the best show in the world, when you hardly advertise it and bury it on Friday's at ten, what do you think is going to happen to it? I mentioned to half a dozen people that I was watching this show and not a single one of them had ever heard of it!? That is besides the point though, my job is review the content and what I saw was very different. The Killing actually took some time to grow on me. It is everything that's advertised, but it's a bit unusual. Rosie Larsen is a seemingly innocent seventeen year old girl, whose body is found inside the trunk of a car, belonging to the campaign of a Mayoral candidate. After the premier episode that introduces us to everyone, the following episodes are broken up into segments. One closely follow every aspect of the police investigation, which is really fascinating. It's also somewhat strange as the two detectives are both in their twenties. Linden (Mireille Enos) has a past, is extremely dedicated to he job, and seemingly has no emotion. Her partner Holder (Joel Kinnaman) is young, good looking, and may have called in some favors to get the job he has. Holder is short tempered and immature, the perfect opposite of Linden, making them a very interesting pair. The next set of segments follows the Mayoral race, we get to deeply know both candidates, their campaigns, and the people who work for them, giving us an unlimited number of suspects. The last of the regular segments, features the heartbroken family of Rosie Larsen and in detail it shows how it effects each member. The story being told is one of the best I've ever seen in a TV show. No one is what they seem, everyone is a suspect, and their are so many twists and turns that you'll be doubting yourself as much as the investigators doubt their instincts. The cast is equally as good and in fact is what makes this show unique. The characters are not the type of characters you'd expect to see in this type of show. The personalities don't quite fit the roles and it leads to some very unusual, but interesting scenes. The Killing was thoroughly enjoyable and should have been a tremendous hit, but poor rating and a network that wasn't really devoted to the show led to it's demise.",Positive
This is a very funny comedian. Some of the skits are are a bit silly and raunchy but overall a very good watch.,Positive
It's very easy to connect with the roles of the actors and feel involved in this series.I recommend this!!,Positive
"I have to say that my husband would give this show four stars, just because this genre is one of his favorites. The characters are interesting (you will recognize actors from Battlestar Galactica and Saving Grace) and the plots are attention-getting. However, the acting isn't consistently strong (as minor characters come and go), and especially in the second season seem a bit contrived. It's as if the producers blew their budget on some good actors and filled in the cast with amateurs.",Negative
This is one of my favorites and I was very glad to find it as an Amazon Prime offering.  My bias includes the fact that I spent my H.S. years in Ft. Lauderdale and was always fascinated by the Everglades.  Now I'm living in Florida again and still love the glades.  I really like this series even though many of the episodes are not set in the Glades at all.,Positive
Jon Stewart is very funny.  Political humor.  I especially like that I can watch it for free on Amazon Prime.  Thanks Amazon!,Positive
Excelent. This is a serie that you have to see. Good quality and great special effects. Congratulations to Amazon for made this wonderfull production. Still waiting for the continuity.,Positive
Every cliche in the book....and did we have to portray a female owner as an accidental owner who is a simpleton?,Negative
"First off, don't read the reviews that have one star. This is a great show. It will make a lot more sense if you start with the first season,The Walking Dead: The Complete First Season, and follow along with the secondThe Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season [Blu-ray] and third seasonsThe Walking Dead: The Complete Third Season [Blu-ray]. I wasn't completely sure about it the first time I watched, but it became addicting. Will be interesting to see what happens with the prison, Carl, and the Governor.",Positive
"An interesting premise that deserves a chance to find its audience.  There are many women who are football fans and many owner's wives and families who sit right there in the box and cheer on game day.  It looks like this show intends to demonstrate that those owner's wives might be capable of running the team - albeit in their own way - and be a success.  I hope it doesn't dissolve into an adult football version of the Bad News Bears, because I am going to stick with it for a while.",Negative
"I was disappointed in that it is a travel advertisement dressed up like a movie. The movie is okay, but I would have not downloaded it had I known.",Negative
"I love Leverage, I was sad to see them end it, when we were traveling for a competition my children found this on cable and we fell in love with it, sometimes it was hard to wait for the next season to be available.  I hope they reconsider and bring it back.  I have bought them all and watch them over and over",Positive
"Reminds me a lot of the film noire TV series Top of the Lake (gritty themes like drugs, police corruption and incest).  Slow paced and deliberate, kind of like the weather on the western shore of Ireland. Got to dig for redemptive factors but main character is complex hero.",Positive
"I have to agree with the low-rating reviews here, the characters are wooden and stereotyped and the plot is a mishmash. I tried, but I could not make it past minute 43. Biblical overtones... really? Not very original, characters'  gratuitious cursing (I don't mind cursing but this seemed too forced) and nudity was annoyingly trite... and I don't give this pilot the strength to hold up for an entire series. (Hey, Fast Forward had a good premise and did not make the cut, when it came to it, Misfits was entertaining but I didn't follow the entire series...) from other reviews I presume there's a monster responsible for all this (implied, smoke in the sky, broken windows, etc. chaos) ... this is just not IMO series-worthy. Again, too much of a similar concept to Fast Forward, but without the mystery. I was prepared to refute negative reviews but seriously couldn't. On another note, does the commercial from the sponsor at the beginning bode Amazon videos with commercial interruptions? I hope not. Sufficient commercials in the world of ""traditional"" and internet media as it is.",Negative

"GREAT SHOW!!!!! I have watched many BBC crime/mystery shows and this ranks among my favorites. Whitechapel"" takes on the issue of a brilliant Detective Inspector suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder WITHOUT making the condition into a joke (a la ""Monk""). Rupert Penry-Jones as DI Chandler is believeable, inspiring and, at times, truly heart-breaking.  His supporting cast is also wonderful. This show has an unusual tone -- which I very much enjoyed. It alludes to all those things that happen all the time that we can't explain, so we ignore. THIS show doesn't ignore them and it makes for very interesting TV!",Positive
this movie was so awesome and really made you think seeing something through a child's eyes is the purest way to see it I loved this movie,Positive
Like the show but the plot appears to repeat itself at times. Beginning to become evident and not surprising which is sad.,Negative
"Little Bill is a wonderful show for learning about life, in general, from a young child's perspective.  Having a 3-generational family makes the show very interesting, but the bigger attraction is that the show addresses a 'cross-section' of the U.S./or the world.  The children and families are of varying ethnic backgrounds...something most U.S. based shows lack altogether.  It is culturally sensitive and doesn't dwell upon children who have an 'abundance.'  It is creative, easy to understand and fun.  And absolutely no violence...quite true to Bill Cosby style.  I would recommend this to any child of any background anwhere!  I wish Amazon would offer the entire series, it would be a great thing option for families such as mine that are in search of these kinds of shows for our little ones.",Positive
We purchase Blacklist via Amazon Video rather than recording. The series is good enough that we do not want to go through commercials. Each episode seems that it is going to be straight forward and then James Spader creates the back story.,Positive
"I was hopeful that the 2nd season of this show would change things up a bit, and make the show more adult friendly. Before anyone calls me out for being an adult complaining about a kids show, take note that it doesn't have to be that way. Avengers: EMH, Batman: Brave and the Bold, Spectacular Spider-Man, and Young Justice are all examples of recent cartoons that were great for both adults and kids alike. The humor doesn't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator in order for kids to like it. That has been proven before, and it saddens me to see one of my favorite characters fall into this trap.",Negative
"He tried to do something different without straying too far from what made him an international star. Which is wise tactics. Statham was best in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in my opinion. But this movie is very watchable. I give him four stars for reaching outside the envelop and delivering--and being as entertaining as usual.",Positive

"My two year old loves gabba. Loves gabba. We watch an episode every single day. The songs get stuck in my head but they are catchy.

"I can't begin to tell you how much I detest a majority of the ""found footage"" films. Every time I see a new released, my eyes roll into the back of my head and I sigh heavily. The only reason I picked up ""The Bay"" when I saw it was the box and tagline caught my attention. If it wasn't for Director Barry Levinson's name attached to it, I would have put it back. After watching it, I'd say it's definitely one of the better films using the shtick.In 2009, the town of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland discovers its water is infected. The mayor refuses to admit the seriousness of the situation even as people begin turning up dead and sick. After several more victims die in public, the town goes into a state of fear and closes down. Several eyewitnesses capture the entire incident on camera and cell phones.I still can't believe a renowned director like Barry Levinson would helm a ""found footage"" movie. The entire concept just seems so below him. It's fairly obvious ""The Bay"" was a pet project for Levinson. He's credited as a co-producer and co-writer of the film. Regardless, he accomplished what he set out to do through adequate pacing and some great stomach-churning scenes, which quite possibly could have some individuals scrambling for a barf bag.The visual effects for ""The Bay"" are impressive. They might be doctored a little with CGI, but for the most part they look practical. I don't know what they used for the nasty little creatures, but I was convinced they were real. That's how you know you're seeing a good movie. You're pulled into it and are never distracted by bad special effects or acting.I have to admit that I laughed while watching the credits as they rolled. I saw Oren Peli's name as one of the producers for ""The Bay"" and said to myself, ""Of course."" I've got to hand it to this guy. He's taken an old gimmick and struck gold with it over and over again.""The Bay"" includes a couple special features. There's audio commentary with Director Barry Levinson. We also get a featurette entitled ""Into the Unknown: Barry Levinson on 'The Bay.'""I can't deny ""The Bay"" is worth a watch. The concept of the film is very believable. That's what makes it so frightening. You come away from it with this nagging suspicion that what you just saw quite easily could happen.",Positive
"Great show, wish it had a longer run.  Especially since I didn't even know about it unit the end of the final season.  This type of quality writing and acting, in a Sci-Fi series, is one of the best I've had the pleasure of watching.",Positive
One of the better reality shows.  I feel like I know them.  Real life people and situations you can't imagine  dealing with yourself.  I find the life they live without so many things we rely on absolutely fascinating.  It has made me realize that so many things aren't really important and I've actually changed some of my own habits!,Positive
The show is overall good but this season took a odd turn. Half the characters from first season at the Rub disappear and the new ones well are a hit and miss.  Overall the relationships between the leads are really good. However the one lead they simply put the the back was the original Rub owner.  She needs more screen time and more development.  Without her there wouldn't be a story.  Like I said - good show overall but definitely needs work on structure and overall story.,Negative
"I love sci-fi and this series just fits the bill.  Well developed characters and great lines, make for a gripping series.",Positive

"When I first told my kids about a new children's show that had science in it, my 10 yr old son said, ""Cool!"", while my 7yr old daughter didn't think she'd like it. Boy was I surprised! After they both watched the show, they were BEGGING FOR ANOTHER EPISODE! Any show that can keep my ADHD daughter engaged and interested is really well done!Programming for school agencies is sorely lacking, especially in this genre. As a country we are woefully behind in the sciences and this show hits the mark. When I told them that there are plans for a website and app so they could get more involved, they hooted and hollered in glee!I'm really hoping this gets made into a series. The there are so many science topics that they conserve into,there shouldn't be any problem coming up with material for new episodes. This is just what we need - a science show that can make kids EXCITED ABOUT SCIENCE! Bravo to the writers and creators. We'll be waiting on pins and needles for future episodes and BOTH my kids have already told their friends about ANNEBOTS!",Positive

"""A Little Bit Zombie"" is what happens when fans of a movie make a movie.  Look, we all love ""Evil Dead"" - or to be precise, we all really love ""Evil Dead II"" because anyone who watches the first installment and expects the hilarious humor of the sequel is in for the shock of their lives - but there's a fine line between an homage and a lame copy.  Unfortunately ""A Little Bit Zombie"" is a little bit in the latter category.The plot, such as it is, centers on HR manager Steve (Kristopher Turner) who is marrying salon stylist and high maintenance fianc&eacute;e Tina (Crystal Lowe).  There's just one problem: Steve's sister and maid of honor Sarah (Kristen Hager) hates Tina, and it's easy to see why.  Fortunately, Steve's best friend Craig (Shawn Roberts) is also Sarah's husband and is there to provide moral support. Things take a turn for the hilarious when Steve is bitten by a zombie mosquito and slowly begins to turn into a cannibalistic brain-eater.  Hunted by a magic orb-wielding hottie Penelope (Emilie Ullerup) and crotchety shotgun-wielding Max (Stephen McHattie), it seems our fun foursome are about to experience a very bad weekend in the woods.The cast is a problem. Turner is passable as a normal guy just trying doing his best to avoid nibbling on his friends' brains, but Lowe is pretty bad in a role that requires her to carry much of the humor.  Her inability to keep up with Hager of ""Being Human"" fame is apparent - the roles could easily have been reversed, as there's more chemistry between Hager and Turner than there is between Turner and Lowe.  Ew.The zombie hunters aren't much better. McHattie plays Max as a psychopath who will blow anything up at a moment's notice, which is probably supposed to be funnier than it is.  For a great example of McHattie's talent put to good use against zombies, see ""Pontypool."" Blonde bombshell Ullerup speaks her lines with her usual wide-eyed wooden acting - if you've seen her turn as Ashley Magnus in ""Sanctuary,"" you know what to expect here.Fortunately, ""A Little Bit Zombie"" doesn't take itself too seriously.  Yes, the homages to ""Evil Dead"" are over the top, from the shed scene to the chuckle-worthy evil-point-of-view-cam, but the film's heart is in the right place even if it the script doesn't hit most of the comedy beats. The ending is appropriately off-key and at least ironic enough to make it worth sticking with the film.""A Little Bit Zombie"" isn't very gory, isn't very funny, and isn't very good - but then it isn't trying to be.  It's just a little bit of all three that makes it a passable entry in the zombie humor genre.",Negative
"I have been excited about, and looking forward to, this series since I heard about the spin off from Vampire Diaries. I was expecting the pilot to be the same episode shown in the Vampire Diaries but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that more detail was included. I really enjoyed this first episode and am looking forward to the series.",Positive
"The title just says it all doesn't it?  Zombie Strippers tells you by title alone whether or not this is your kind of flick or not, and if it is, you should be pretty well satisfied with what you get here.  In the not too distant future, the government has outlawed public nudity and is experimenting with re-animating dead flesh.  Hence the title, when a zombie outbreak begins at a secret, illegal strip club run by a germophobe (a gleeful Robert ""Freddy Kruger"" Englund).  It isn't long before a number of the dancers not only start craving human flesh, but also become an even bigger draw, which you know of course inevitably leads to a nasty, gorey massacre.  With tongue firmly in cheek and even featuring some decent political gags, Zombie Strippers features some great practical gore effects (and some cruddy CGI effects), and also features adult entertainment icon Jenna Jameson, who actually seems to be having some fun with it all.  All in all, Zombie Strippers by all rights and purposes should be a terrible, terrible flick, but it ends up being an enjoyable romp that is more than worth checking out if zombies, B-movies, or just plain trash is your pleasure.",Positive
"Usually with a second season of any show, the writers seem to lose steam and the show fizzles. Not this show!! If anything it keeps getting better with every episode!!",Positive

"I wonder why more people don't watch this show.  I look forward to each episode as I love to watch these wonderfully attractive, talented young actors.",Positive
Very well written screen play. Great Actors doing a very good job.  Can't wait to see a whole season of this.  Good character development already in just the pilot.,Positive
"I don't know why writers have this overwhelming need to bring down every happy couple. Why can't some of them remain happy? However, it turns out the divorce doesn't really happen and Rory and Amy love each other as much as they always did. Sorry, spoiler.Lots of color, action, bangs and noises as usual. Not much of a plot. The final couple of twists to the story were interesting, I won't add any more spoilers, though.I like Matt Smith as the Doctor. But the Matt Smith stories lack the emotional depth and character interest of the David Tennant stories. That's not Matt Smith's fault. It's the fault of the writers.",Negative
"I'm sorry if this is nit-picky, but NO respectable lady would allow herself to be in the same room, let alone the same house, as a prostitute, and no respectable gentleman would allow his wife to stay in that room/house. I don't care if the owner of the house thought it was okay or not, his guests would have left as soon as the ""ho"" walked in. This was the Victorian period...ladies did NOT mingle with prostitutes. Do the writers seriously not know this??? I thought this show was trying to be historically accurate.And the women's dresses in this episode were atrocious. I noticed how ugly they were in previous episodes, but I was willing to overlook that, until this episode. A very recent widow--who should still be in mourning, I don't care who she thinks she is, or how open-minded she is--would NEVER show herself in public in a WHITE ballgown! Are you kidding me???  Who is the costumer on this show? Not only was it white, but it looked like a wedding gown...HELLO!!  Again, who is dressing these people?!! I guess I'm just used to the higher quality and attention to detail I see on other BBC shows like Downton Abbey, for example. I've never seen such deplorable costumes on a BBC show in this century! And don't try to argue there was a war going on. This was the North, and these people are supposed to be VERY wealthy. They can afford the best silks and satins, etc. So the women should be dressed to fit their station. They don't seem to have a problem dressing the wh@res to look like wh@res...why can't they dress the upper class characters correctly?I could have overlooked these seemingly minor details except it seems as if great pains have been taken with the rest of the show to make it as accurate as possible, so the whole costume debacle is just sad, bad, and beyond my comprehension.Then there's the awful acting, that I won't even go into.The first several episodes were interesting, but once the bad acting became too much to bear any longer, and the hideous costumes made my eyes bleed with their ugliness, I had to stop watching. If this show gets another season, I hope they get a bigger budget and can afford some better costumes and more talented actors.",Negative
"It is hard to do science fiction which is actually science fiction. This show has the feel of the TV Star Trek: The Next Generation. Few science fiction shows approach the pure science fiction of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, the original 3 films;  Dr. Who, the prisoner or Twilight Zone. The production values of Extant  and the acting are excellent, yet, it does not appear from this episode to be taking us where  no man or woman has not gone before. What I mean by that is, while it is entertaining, Extant is going to have to show greater originality rather than being a rehash of human problems no matter how media current those problems are. Yet, it is too early to tell; and I may well change my comments here to something more favourable.",Negative

It was a dang shame they took this show off the air.  It was really well done.  I miss it a lot!!,Positive
"One of the best shows on Primetime. Josh Holloway, like always, does not disappoint. Has a variety of different topics for each show. Would highly recommend.",Positive
"Beautiful scenery, believable characters..enjoyed this series immensely..so much better than American crime dramas. I wish that there had been another season to view.",Positive
Ya this movie started off ok but then slowly declined into a crappy horror movie with some music thrown in. Pretty much the same songs are  just used over and over again throughout the movie and are not clever at all. Acting is ok but nothing special. The killer was kinda cool but even that annoying after awhile. I wouldn't recommend this at all.,Negative
I love Haven and have watched it since the beginning. I have thoroughly enjoyed the show. it is unique and character driven.,Positive

I like for  my grandson to watch Cailou because there is parent interaction with the child.  So many of these children shows have and understood parent influence but you never see the parent.,Positive
"I love the history and all the various theories and ideas. This show is for those with an open mind who enjoy entertaining the idea that part of history could include visitors from another galaxy. They do make a compelling case at times, and of course I don't always agree. Still this is really fun to watch.",Positive
"One of my husband's friends recommended this show to him so we decided to check it out. We were able to watch the first season on Netflix but the second season wasn't available yet, so I pre-ordered it on here.

"This is one of my favorite series, I'm so sorry it's over. Well done, not cheesy. Fine acting, good story lines. Some humor thrown in with Walter, he's awesome.

"Having read through the rest of the reviews, I can say that I agree with most of what was written and so shall not expand on the positive parts of the show.  However, I had to dock the show a couple of stars for lack of character development.To explain my reasoning: Josh and Sally in particular have not developed at all (in my opinion) during all 3 seasons. I find myself gritting my teeth like a mother with two 3-year old kids in the house who just cant seem to quiet down for a minute. Sally still has the bad habit of wanting to toss her *fairly petty* problems onto Josh and Aidan, many times without reading the mood because both of them come home in a shabby state usually just having passed through a horrible experience. I find her lack of empathy disturbing. Josh - well what can I say about Josh.. He has 1 day a month when he turns. Listening to him go on and on about being a werewolf.. blah blah blah blah blah. He still hasn't gotten to the point where he can say ""I have a rental box to change in, everything's fine.""  Aidan has to fight his thirst every day of the damn year, yet Josh and Sally seem oblivious to it, depending on him for (far too much) emotional support. Also, listening to Josh lay on the guilt trip when Aidan slips up and turns or kills a human.. He's a VAMPIRE. A true friend would help clean up the mess.I would have given this more stars, had Josh and Sally grown up a little from the pity party they are throwing themselves. Listening to Josh go on and on with his panic attacks while trying to revive Sally..  Oh please, just SHUT UP already so she can cast the damn spell.",Negative
"..Or change the outfit to purple and call it Hawkeye for Marvel comic fans.  The show is okay, but not as good as I had hoped and certainly not original concept or storylines at all.",Negative
"Though I suspect the theme has always been there, only with Season 3 have I realized that this is an essentially religious narrative.  But it's a religion in which God plays little.  Unlike prior seasons, this one has little mention of organized religion or church, and when George stands over a dying man, he can't even remember the words to the Shema.  Instead, this religion pits the communion of the house against the greedy individualism of the larger world.This bleak vision of Wales, all shabby brick and abandoned industrial iron, creates a look of despair and desolation.  Which probably explains why they have the Hawaii mural in their house: they've build a paradise within their own walls.  In a significant deleted scene from episode 2, Annie calls Mitchell her ""saviour.""  These characters' ad hoc religion lets them resist a bleak and godless world through the sacrament of just remaining together.Notably, when Mitchell crosses into the afterlife to retrieve Annie, he describes the place he finds as ""Purgatory.""  The place of purging, where sins are expunged by recognition and contrition.  This religion doesn't have much need for Heaven or Hell, God or Satan, but it prizes guilt and culpability.  The only hope against encroaching struggle and despair comes in unity and society.  Notice how militantly individualistic the other vampires and werewolves are.This makes their house a monastery.  The characters eat together, find love within their own walls, and ""pray"" as a group by standing together against their damaged natures.  But without a shared theology, they have to face their sins directly.  Without Jesus to save or Buddha to guide, their religion makes them remember their sins over and over again.  They persevere, not to save their own souls, but because they can only be saved together.This season's deep immersion in death and the afterlife is much darker than previous seasons.  As our heroes aid zombies while fighting wolves and vampires, they stand together against the world, becoming stronger only as a group.  Though they have an evangelism program, inasmuch as they reach out to McNair and the resurrected Herrick, sin constantly comes from outside.  Without God, they only have each other.  But is that enough?",Positive
"Loved &#34;Smash&#34; during its brief life on NBC.  Have been looking for it on Blu-Ray, but so far, I haven't found it.  Amazon Instant Video offered a solution.

I feel Gaby Hoffman is on the cusp of breaking out and becoming a real star. Tambor is great as always and..well...the acting is great across the board to be honest. So far I have seen three of the five amazon original series and I liked this the most, especially more than the GOD-AWFUL &#34;The After&#34; - and this is coming from a HUGE chris carter fan. Here's hoping Transparent gets a full season pickup!",Positive
The movie is okay. It started off weak by showing that the black man saying that he was innocence when it had appeared that he and his accomplish had broken into the police car plus he was carrying a assault weapon then he let loose his hostage. It could've started off a little better than that.How could the old lady maid get kidnap by those thugs if the power was down. How did they get pass the fench if the black guy had to ram the truck through it. Good luck.,Negative

He still pulls out a good show every once in a while tho so I say keep it up, just need it a bit less self indulgence, if possible .",Positive
"I've heard some good reviews from other sites about this movie..that is why I got the time to watch it and judge it my self. Well, from my point of view, this movie has:- Few new elements (at least for me).- Fair scattered scares (jumps) in different portions (different stories!!) of this movie.- Majority of acting is fair but not good.- Some scares are of the type that can creeps you out.- Lot of unnecessary elements and scenes that got me bored.In overall I didn't like this movie because I got bored as there is no build up of story maybe some people can see it but I couldn't. Maybe because of that ..I couldn't get scared into the level I expected (I expected it from the reviews I heard!).It is a &#34;watch once&#34; movie for me.",Negative
"I didn't expect such a goofy episode to be big on character development, but my oh my poor Claudia. It makes complete sense that her deepest fear is that her life now, weird weird warehouse life, is just a figment of her mind. She came off as genuinely terrified, and I wanted her to be okay.I could have done without dufus calling the monster-Hannah ""Beotch"" and all of the lampshaded fanservice, but overall it was a good episode.",Positive
"Was really looking forward to this as the premise mirrors my own life in so many ways, but oy, the writing is weak, the main character is a piece of wood (we're supposed to think he's deeply disturbed and divided through flashbacks of him as a kid protecting his older brother), but there's no vision of the turmoil inside Barry (Basam) except through his tepid American (blonde, of course) wife, who keeps pestering him and saying there's no joy in their life (well, why hang around so long then?).  So Barry/Basom clearly has issues to work on, and I liked the storyline, but there's no depth, it's all formulaic cartoon that was done much better in Syriana and other films on Arab potentates, the potential for political reform, good son vs. bad son, etc.  Bummer.  Could've been a contender.",Negative
"I love every minute, every human entree, every psychological twist.Give this show your undivided attention or you will miss the fabulous (subtle) details in Hannibal's cooking, attire and art.If you don't want to pay for season 2 on Amazon, you can watch it on NBC online ( for free)",Positive

"How It's Made documentary series are awesome for anyone who needs to know how common items that we know and use everyday are made. If you are a person with 'inquisitive' mind then these series are a true goldmine of information. We never had cable TV before so I never came across these series before as they were aired on Science channel. I accidentally discovered these while browsing Amazon Instant video offerings for Prime Members.I have just finished watching Volume 1 and I do like it. It was very informative and I am sure you will like these series too. Having said, Some episodes are too crammed and combines various manufacturing techniques in very short period of time. The information is there but the depth is missing. But for inquisitive mind this is a good start. I hope future episodes will get better.Worth watching to satisfy your curiosity. Four stars! for Volume 1.",Positive
"Even though the season just started and I just finished watching the first episode, I have to say I was very impressed with the season starter.  Just as with prior seasons the unexpected happens and the gore is just as impressive as in the best, but better because of the prior seasons of working on the models, sculptures, etc. that make the unbelievable, believable.  One thing always amazes me, and that is it is always summer in the series, never winter. Georgia is not hot and humid all year round, but that is just a minor issue.I started watching ""The Walking Dead"" since the very beginning and I hope the rest of this season compliments and connects well with the past seasons.  BTW, great title for the first episode of the season.Cheers!",Positive
This show is great. I really like the characters a lot. They are very relatable and you care about what happens to them.,Positive
Our family loves how I met your mother.  We watch it as often as we can.  Barney is such a funny character.,Positive
"When the savagely distasteful reviews for &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; dropped earlier this year, I was baffled.  I mean, &#8216;Drive&#8217; was pretty much critically applauded and continues to earn raves from cinephiles, and Ryan Gosling is kind of like beloved by nearly everyone (I said nearly), so how in the world could the much anticipated follow-up to their surprise masterpiece be such a terrible film?  I chucked it up people just not &#8216;getting it&#8217; and figured that they MUST be wrong.Nicolas Winding Refn couldn&#8217;t have dropped the ball THAT far, could he?You can go ahead and sound the alarm, because the world that hated &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; was correct and pretty much hit every nail on the head.  I&#8217;m just as baffled as the ten other people who have yet to see this (I&#8217;m always late to the party), but believe me, this film is atrocious in ways I can&#8217;t even put into words.  I&#8217;m almost loathe to admit that I liked anything about this movie (the cinematography is gorgeous, the costumes are divine and that score is Oscar worthy) simply because the overall product is so dreadful.I am an advocate for the whole mantra &#8216;less is more&#8217;.  I love a subtle and inviting flow to a film because that slow burn allows the characters and the plot to thrive, unravel and blossom.  &#8216;Drive&#8217; had that, despite what you may think.  I think that was a chief complaint from the movie going public, since they were anticipating another &#8216;Fast and the Furious&#8217; and wound up getting something much slower, deeper and darker.  When I read the countless reviews complaining that &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; was too slow, too vacant or too quiet I actually thought that the critics were experiences a bad case of memory loss.  Didn&#8217;t we go through this already two years ago?  Don&#8217;t you know that Refn&#8217;s films are NOT what they appear but so much more than they appear?Memory loss or not, those complaints are legit.That is my biggest issue with &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; and a chief complaint I had with another film I saw recently (&#8216;To the Wonder&#8217;).  In fact, I foolishly watched those films back to back and I felt like I was watching a double feature on absolutely nothing.  Where &#8216;Drive&#8217; developed not only an intricate plot but a protagonist who felt real and crushing, &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; forgets to develop much of anything.  Instead, we are given scattered characters who say very little and only know how to emote a singular expression (I&#8217;m still not sure what that expression is, although I strongly feel that it could be constipation) and then one broadly stroked caricature who has all the obvious clich&eacute;s of the &#8216;monster mom&#8217; and yet none of the grounding to make her feel real, believable or even remotely entertaining (I love you Kristen, but what are you doing here?).  The plot itself is another &#8216;shrug of the shoulders&#8217; as it fails to be interesting or gripping but instead serves as a blank canvas for the characters to inflict horrific bodily pain on others and for the effects department to produce large amounts of fake blood.Gosling plays a man named Julian, a drug-smuggler living in Bangkok.  The film&#8217;s opening sequences portray Julian&#8217;s unstable brother butchering a young prostitute and then being beaten to death by her father.  Julian&#8217;s unhinged mother shows up to bury her son and exact revenge on the men responsible for her son&#8217;s death, including a sadistic police officer.  Julian doesn&#8217;t want to get involved, but his mother is a whirlpool and he&#8217;s soon getting beaten up by the cop and avenging his mother.At least I think so.There are so many distasteful things about this movie, and so many lazy aspects.  I didn&#8217;t expect Refn to pen such a poorly constructed disaster, but his script is so bare and so unintelligent, and the barely there dialog doesn&#8217;t help any.  I think Gosling says about ten things, and he doesn&#8217;t wear any expression on his face but that of &#8216;deep concentration&#8217; (or constipation, as I mentioned already) and so you really get no handle on who this man is.  Many scenes in the film feel so unnecessary or not even that but more pointless or ridiculous (as in, they don&#8217;t belong).  The relationship between Julian and his mother is never fleshed out and so it winds up feeling put upon and laughable, especially when he subjects a prostitute to dinner with his tactless mother (seriously, remind me again why he wants her to meet his mother), bares up under his mother&#8217;s insults and then berates his date (at least he shifts his facial features long enough to scream), demanding she take off the dress he purchased for her.I don&#8217;t think I can count the amount of times I stared at the screen, completely lost as to why anything that was going on was going on because nothing really &#8216;was&#8217; going on.Much like &#8216;To the Wonder&#8217;, I&#8217;m left wondering if the bulk of this film is sitting on the cutting room floor somewhere, and if so, why didn&#8217;t someone take the editor out and shoot them?  I mean, this can&#8217;t be the film Refn intended to release, right?  Is this his idea of a joke?  Maybe he intended to create something so hideous and so nonsensical that it could only be considered genius, because there really is no other explanation for it.Guess what Nicolas; you&#8217;re plan didn&#8217;t work!",Negative
"I loved this series, I remember when it first started and my daughter was hooked on it, I didn't think I would like it.  Then it came to Amazon Prime and I fell in love with it.....okay lots of holes in the plot and lots of issues with logic, but it is still a good watch.",Positive
I didn't think this one would be too good but I decided to give it a try. Overall it's a pretty good show - has some funny stuff and a pretty good plot line. Good entertainment!,Positive
"Great Characters, great situations, moves quick, Episodes are short and entertaining a lot like a comic strip. Well done Trudeau!",Positive
"NCIS Season 9 - excited to get to this season, but still on season 6.  Love the DVDS - only wish all of them had the option to PLAY ALL episodes.  Some seasons do and some don't - I like to start the DVD and let it play through the 4 episodes without interruption....Great show and great cast.",Positive
It's kind of a weighty and deep-seated film about a young man or boy(?) trying to find his way in life.  Not for the carefree and light-hearted.,Positive
"Interesting first-rate actors, interesting plot twists.  There are always at least 2 subplots going on simultaneously.  One of them is recurring, so it makes you really want to see the next episode.  Also a touch of humor to go with the detective murder stuff.  I wish they had made more seasons of this show.  But the lead actor went on to even bigger and better things.",Positive
"If you think you are feeding your family well, you have no idea just how wrong you are. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to be healthy or thinks they are but are so far off.",Positive
"I have found it just un-self conscious enough to watch without any negative vibes.  She looks good in all disguises and can really run in stiletto heels.  Don't know if all the exotic scenes from around the world or actually &#34;on location&#34; but they add.  Piper appears to be a real athlete, but this is Hollywood.",Positive
"Serving up drag realness, hunty! Loving every minute of the show. I hope it continues. Lots of laughs. Great cast. RuPaul is witty and wonderful. Love Santino and Michelle Visage. Lots of celeb judges.",Positive
I was intrigued by the dramatization of the series at the movie theatre but this TV episode is just awful. I have had enough. Nothing further need be said!,Negative
My husband and I really enjoy this show. The team is so professional and they have great rapport with each other. We would really like to see more seasons from time to time available with our Prime membership. This is just a tease,Positive
"I love this show, it is funny and when I need a little break this is just the thing.  They really did this well.  I have been telling my friends and found out that my cousin likes it too.  If you want a little light- hearted entertainment this is the one.  I think it is great even for adult who are young at heart.",Positive
"falling skies keeps you on edge constantly.  every episode is packed with what is going to happen next, it just keeps you riveted to you chair.",Positive
Too much on the long deep philosophic speeches during crisis that just require grabbing your butt and heading out. We got the deep connections after the first 10 minutes.  Coulda been good. Too forced.,Negative
BY FAR - The funniest episode in &#34;It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.&#34;  It's not just the main story but the subplot of Dee trying to create her own Sex and the City 'girls club' is hilarious.,Positive
"The show is enjoyable and I'm interested to see where it's going, though I wish I cared more about the main character.",Positive
"I just started watching this program, but I like it very much.  It has some interesting story lines such as using a Chemprinter to make your own medications at home instead of relying upon a pharmacy.  I wish!",Positive
Not great but entertaining... You always look for the few seconds of one of the Characters to morph and reveal their true nature...,Positive
The acting is not that great but the story is very relevant to todays social media addicted world.  it definitley deserves a full season of viewing.,Positive
"This series is on a whole other level.  The main character reminds me a bit of Fox Mulder, clinging to an ever deteriorating foothold on reality.  You know who the villain is, right from the start, but that doesn't stop or even dull the suspense from building or the surprises from shocking you.  This is a slow burn psychological series you can't help but enjoy.",Positive
"As much as we all make jokes about lawyers, this series shows the thinking of lawyers and some of the very human aspects of the profession.",Positive
"Great storyline, good characters with exciting action. This is a fun to watch action drama from the History Channel, good quality fun entertainment, a must see!",Positive
"I am enjoying he first season of Defiance which is an interesting look at a future St. Louis in which humans and aliens coexist, although not always peacefully.",Negative
It's a shame that there are so many addicts that there needs to be a reality show about them. I am forever ashamed at how self absorbed so many of them are!,Positive
"Team Umioomi is a bit derivative; it uses the same conventions as Dora and other shows to ask kids to participate. However, the pattern and geometric object recognition aspects are wonderful introductions to mathematics. The episodes are never &#34;scary&#34; and they always seem to have a positive emotional outlook.",Positive
This is my favorite show to watch every week. I was never a zombie movie fan but I do like watching the group go through their struggles each week just to stay alive.,Positive
"Having worked in the animation industry as a composer for 30 years, and more recently as a writer of children's programing, here are my thoughts.The Show's LookLittle Airplane's signature is all over this show. Always pastel in coloring with a soft and cottony look to it. Though it is limited animation in that it's mostly mouth movements, eye blinks and computerized figure morphing, it has a charming look and was quite appealing with beautiful backgrounds. Certainly aimed at a preschool to k-1 demographic.The ConceptI'm not sure what the format of ""The Jo B. & G. Raff Show"" is within the series itself. It appears that the show ""inside the show"" is always postponed because G. Raff has gone on an adventure all by himself and Jo B. is abandoned by his friend? That said, the interim resolution of needs is a great lesson for kids:""If I give a little and you give a little, together we can meet in the middle"".However, it seemed like G. Raff got EXACTLY what he wanted and... when he wanted it.What's not clear is what ""The Jo B. & G. Raff Show"" is inside the show? I'm not sure it matters as we seem to have a little performance of it at the end of the episode. But is seemed odd not to know its content.CurriculumThe rest of the show's concept appears to be exploration by G. Raff of new places and things - what they are like and what's there to learn - G. Raff's discoveries. Here, the lesson is... to learn something new one must move out of ones comfort zone AND...  ""If I give a little and you give a little, together we can meet in the middle"" and learn something new! An SEL (Social Emotional Learning) basis for the show.Plot / Story ArcIt appears it will develop the same way each time. Jo B. will try to start the show and notice G Raff is missing. What unfolds will drive a novel plot structure. G. Raff is in a space station. G. Raff is in a rain forest. G. Raff is exploring butterflies in New Guinea. But the negative here for kids and parents may be abandonment issues.The CharactersFor me the character's traits are embedded in the voice casting. That's not a criticism. It's excellent voice casting and direction. However, what's on the page probably doesn't ""read"" with the flavor that IS imparted by these wonderful kids voices.Joe B., ""I like it under the sea but... we have to get home and do our show... like now"". G. Raff, ""Your right Jo B. but I've been doing some fantastic exploring down here under the sea"".Additionally the singing fish were quite fun and a novel twist on the plot.The MusicAs a professional film music artists, I can't underscore enough (ha) how will the music is done for this series. It is excellently timed and paced to the emotions in the scenes. If one could hear the dialogue tracks alone, the realization of what the score is accomplishing dramatically would be a revelation to the average viewer. However, as it is a complete executed unit, it's contribution disappears. But... it was NOT lost on me!ConclusionThe Jo B. & G. Raff Show is right up there in production values and content of the other Little Airplane shows. Is it as strong as ""Wonder Pets""?  I guess that will be told in the other episodes and in the marketplace. Conceptually, my feeling is, though beautifully executed in every way, its format and style is not so strong as to totally capture the hearts and minds of preschoolers and their parents as did Wonder Pets.",Positive
Its's easy to feel for the tortured main character. His confusion and frustration is relayed well by the former Lucius from Harry Potter.,Positive
"We loved this fast moving pilot. The writers/directors did a wonderful job building Bosch's character over the course of the pilot. I'm a big fan of the Michael Connelly series, so it is no surprise that I enjoyed this show. However, my wife, who has not read any of the Bosch novels, enjoyed the show as much as I did. You have a sure winner, here, Amazon!",Positive
"I liked the performance of Michael Gambon. He is a very good actor. I liked the premise of the show, he had a home life, with a wife. What I found difficult to deal with, a British actor playing a French policeman? It would have been better on location in England. I only bought the first show, disappointed. Thanks!",Negative
"I loved this show and the entire time had know idea what I was really going on.  I loved the characters, especially, the &#34;old woman,&#34; played by, Sharon Lawrence, who is not old at all, and the prisoner, played by, Aldis Alexander Basil Hodge, who I thought was really great!  I do not like scary movies, so I am surprised that I enjoyed this show as much as I did, and want to see more!",Positive
My 3 year old son loves this season. Always new things to learn & the music is great too. Cookie Monster & Elmo are his favorites. Will definitely keep watching!,Positive
"The cast is stellar and the acting is superb.  There are original songs, dance numbers and plots and sub plots that keep you coming back for more.  Bravo!",Positive
"I loved it. Well written, acted and directed. The 26 minutes flew by and I wanted more. Too often with TV today, we have to sit through a few awkward early episodes before the show either hits it's stride or just fails to gain traction. Betas hooked me right from the start with no reservations and I wanted more!This is another Pilot that actually would serve perfectly as a first Episode with out a need for any reworking of the show, cast, writing, etc... Top notch and Network TV worthy, definitely has potential to match some of the best cable network programs as well.",Positive
This show is quite different from Stargate because it has a story line from one show to the other and can be followed accordingly.  The plot has a lot of suspense and mystery to it but is quite intertaining.  Would recommend this show.,Positive
"The show is a great start to what will hopefully be a full season.  Bill Murray's breakdown in the first few minutes is comedic gold and the rest of show keeps rolling from there.  The characters all reside in an atypical frat house and seem quite settled in their arrangement.  The real juice of the show comes from the fact that they are all politicians, seasoned at that.  I like that the show did not delve to heavily into political intrigue, but kept it a light, satirical level.  Great show, funny, witty, excellent cast ( looking at you John Goodman)...seconds please!",Positive
"I am a massive fan of the Fringe series, but this season was a let down. I understand they tried to wrap everything up as they knew it was the final season, but it didn't wrap everything (or anything) up. The idea was great, I loved the premise, but it left too many questions unanswered for me - how can any of the Fringe events occur if the observers are prevented from being created? How can an observer pull Peter and Walter from the river if Walter stops them from being created??? How, I ask you??? How????So basically, while the series is exciting, it doesn't make sense. If you can overlook that (which I certainly did in the end), then you will like this season.",Positive
"A community's symphony orchestra transitions from the long-standing conductor/maestro to the young, internationally-renowned one - with all the political intrigue this situation would generate.  Nothing like talented, artistic individuals to want things his/her own way.  Concurrently, the drama and lives of young musicians are showcased.  A really unique premise for a series.  A breath of fresh air, actually.Hope this one makes the cut to move forward.Thanks, Amazon!",Positive
Love to watch.  Always want to get rid of things after watching.  Definitely something that keeps my interest and will watch again and again.,Positive
"I always have had a certain interest in this area, and I just find the show  really good and more believable than others I've seen.",Positive
Harry Bosch is a compelling character. A fine detective who to his detriment marches to his own drumbeat setting dramatic tensions that are suspenseful and engaging. This was a great pilot. Please give us more.,Positive
"I was surprised and delighted with this excellent Norwegian riff on the ""found footage"" genre.  This time we have all the clips from a student's documentary on trolls put in chronologically order.  Shot in verit&eacute; style in the vein of films like CLOVERFIELD, TROLLHUNTER follows three persistent Norwegian film students as they travel to a remote mountain region in hopes of capturing a real-life troll on camera - a creature whose existence has been understandably covered up for decades by the local government.  They claim there's nothing to worry about - it's just a problem with bears making trouble in the more remote mountains and forests of Norway.  Yes, there have been attacks.  Local hunters and the film students' don't believe the disinformation and their determination pays off when they stalk a shadowy poacher and finally get him to agree to let them record his hunt, their encounters wit the fearsome giants and the troll hunter's heroics.This is the coolest monster movie I've seen in a long time.  Having to read the English subtitles while listening to the Norwegian sound track only added to the verisimilitude.  The beautiful cinematography makes ample use of strikingly beautiful, sometimes frozen, Norwegian locations.This entertaining and sometimes funny movie was written and directed by Andr&eacute; vredal.  Although everyone, including Andr&eacute;, is an unknown to US audiences, I understand the Otto Jespersen, the wonderful actor who plays the dour troll hunter, is a well-known satiric comedian in Norway.  The creature effects are top-notch and I even felt kind of sorry for the fearsome, deformed, gigantic, dumb, mutant trolls who are the last of their mythic breed.Among the several extras including a director's commentary, there's an interesting but too brief but fascinating featurette that shows the steps and ""wire frame"" schematics required to insert the seamless lumbering, fearsome, pitiable, digital trolls into the action.",Positive
"First off, let me say I thought this film was good, full of action & excitement, but having watched all the shows (except Voyager) & all 10 past films, I really was disappointed that the writers & filmakers chose an alternate timeline, Vulcan's destruction & the death of Spock's mother makes some ""TOS"" episodes & the films ""Star Trek I, III, & IV"" no longer exist, this is quite a disappointment, & the fact that the show ""Enterprise"" has been constantly critisized for certain inconsistencies & no one is making that same argument here based on current reviews leads me to think that those critical of ""Enterprise"" never really watched it or they just didn't like Scott Bakula's Captain Archer, anyway despite this, the film is well done, Karl Urban really captures Dr.McCoy's mannerisms, no suprise there, he did the same thing playing a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones' Woodrow Call for ""Commanche Moon""(""Lonesome Dove's"" prequel), the guys playing the younger Spock & Sulu were really good picks & very true to the characters, Sulu weilded a sword in the TOS episode ""Naked Now"" & the woman playing Uhura was also a good pick, Bruce Greenwood was very commanding a Pike, much like the original character, however I am still unsure about Chris Pine as Kirk, sure he captured some of Shatner's mannerisms, but I am not sure he really looks the part, I had a hard time believing he could evolve into William Shatner, the guy playing his dad at the beginning looked more like a young Shatner than Pine did, & would have been a better choice I think, Simon Pegg was half & half on Scotty, he had the mannerism, but was bit goofy, unlike the original Scotty, Ben Cross was good as Spock's father Sarek, as was Winona Ryder as his mother Amanda, they really reminded me of the older counterparts in the 80's films, & finally Eric Bana is again underused here just as he was in ""Troy"" who's Romulan echoes that of the Picard's clone in ""Nemesis"", in fact it seems they couldn't come up with nothing but a retread of ""Nemesis'"" villian here, this is what happens when you put a non-fan in the director's chair like J.J. Abrams, who is a good director, but him being a non-fan really shows here, again you would think that Paramount would have learned from all the complaints fans had about Rick Berman & Brannon Braga on ""Enterprise"",but then again do stuido cheifs really care about this franchise? NO!!! just how much it will make & what name they can attach to it, this new film is an attempt to capture new fans & give older fans the finger in the name of the almighty dollar, however when you watch ST:NG's ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", there are parallels somewhat in regard to an alternate timeline, & ""Deep Space Nine"" was guilty of doing episodes like this too, as did ""Enterprise"" with the ""Mirror Darkly"" episodes, which is how I see this film, an alternate timeline pure & simple, can't hate this one since the shows did it too.",Positive
"19 Episodes on 5 DiscsHaving never watched ""Saving Grace"" before, I didn't know what to really expect from this series. Academy Award winner Holly Hunter heads up the cast as Grace, a detective who happens to have a guardian angel named Earl. A show like this could easily get preachy and turn certain people off, but I was surprised to find it presented in such an even matter that most people could stick with it.Grace herself is a flawed character and no angel. Grace isn't sure what she believes and doesn't pray. Not being perfect and having lots of issues as well as a tough job facing homicides, bombings, and a near-death experience makes her someone to root for. Holly Hunter is a down-home kind of girl with a very distinctive accent that clearly dictates she does not believe she is better than anyone else. The short version is that she is the opposite of every stereotype naysayers might expect and she is very easy to relate to since she doesn't have all the answers.Holly Hunter's wit, enthusiasm, and sense of humor when things are going down around her are very attractive and charismatic qualities. She pulls out serious acting chops of emotion whenever she needs to as in one case where Grace needs to convince an alcoholic that she is one too and trick her into breaking her three year sobriety to get answers. Hunter never shies away from a challenge and always manages to bring the mood back to a light place full of laughs eventually.A great deal of this season revolves around a girl who falls into a coma that Earl claims Grace needs to help. A series of challenges are put in front of her in her work life, her family, her relationships, and her friends. Eventually her own spirituality and faith are questioned, but only in retrospect to bigger issues taking place in the plot.There is a love interest component, a best friend angle, and lots of crime drama to solve and all this helps keep it a more rounded story.Bonus Features: None",Positive
"This is the season when Dean dies because he has dealt Sam's survival in the place of his own life by trading his soul with a demon, and he got a one year delay before going to hell. The whole season is going to turn around the dilemma for Sam and for Dean. Sam will resist the idea of Dean's death and will do all he can to save him, including by dealing his own death instead, but Dean is willing to die since he-they has-have given everything to this war against the Monster, the yellow eyed demon that killed their mother, and that they supposedly killed at the end of the second season, and this war has brought them nothing as for life, enjoying life, etc. Better dying than just surviving on nothing at all, or even a dry bone. For Sam the only problem is that Dean's death means he will be alone to go on with this fight and that frightens him though we see him operating a couple of times alone and he can manage properly.We could think then the season would be rather dull. But there you are wrong and the next season is being prepared very carefully.First it is fun to fight demons. So we have a Christmas special this year, and a real Christmas special it is with reminiscences from the past when the two little boys were alone for Christmas when their father was hunting. And neither of them both forgot to get a present, no matter how little, for the other since anyway Dean did not believe in Father Christmas and Sam was told it was all a fake, a scam, a tall tale. But the Christmas party they enjoy now with two nice little Celtic survivors who decide to have some fun for this Christmas and enjoy a good old cannibalistic feast gives quite some enlightening for to the celebration. We can wonder if the mention of the pagan and Christian sides of Christmas, and this including Christmas in the show mean something or at least are there for a reason; other than simply a Christmas special because it was broadcast one week or two before Christmas, though the series being in real time, there is no reason why Christmas should not be present, especially since it shows how the two brothers when younger and forlorn, some could say neglected if not abandoned by their father, looked after each other including with Christmas presents that were valueless in themselves though emotionally of great value for the two boys.Second it is Reality Show TV time really and fully and they have to have their own reality show and they do with some real blood and flesh dummies who want to visit and track if not trap the ghost who is haunting the Morton House. One of the dummies will die in the adventure, the intern of course which does not count much, not one of the brains of the caper, and they will not be able to put the money in their bank though because Sam and Dean have manipulated their computers with a big magnet that erased all the programs, reformatted the hard disk in a jiffy.Third let's think of the poor children that are chased away from the TV and this series because of the gross nature of these horrible monsters. So let's have one full episode on fairy tales. Unluckily it is a girl in a coma who should have been unplugged from the survival equipment a long time ago by her own father, the doctor, who is reenacting in real life the fairy tales her father is telling her in her coma. The versions of Snow White and the Little Red Riding Hood are amazing and the way Sam and Dean manage to save the poor Little Red Riding Hood from the Big Bad Wolf is heroic and absolutely entertaining for very young children who will be able to learn that they must not go alone to the woods nor get in the cars of strangers.But the war against evil is serious and has little to do with a fairy tale. So let's go back to work, boys.This year is built on the presence of two women. Bela, who could be Bella of course, is a girl whose specialty is to steal ancient objects in order to sell them for a profit. She steals anything the boys, particularly Dean, may have in their pockets. A mummified hand for example, an enchanted rabbit's foot or the famous colt that can kill the Demon with one bullet. But that is too much, far too much and that will lead to the ferocious end of Dean being taken to hell by the Hounds of Hell and will end up, like in Hellraiser and Hellbound, two fairy tales told in many chapters and volumes by Saint Clive Barker, stretched out at the tip end of hooks tied up to chains that are going to dismember him forever and ever, each body part growing back after having been ripped off, I guess. A delicious ending for a monster hunter.A second woman, Ruby, who is a demon possessing a woman, is going to haunt the two boys because she wants to help and Sam is ready if not keen to listen and accept. But Dean and Sam refuse bluntly when she suggests to Sam to learn how to use his psychic power that can defeat Lilith, the demon who is after Dean's life. So he can't in the final confrontation with the girl who was possessed by Lilith and had caused a lot of damage, who has been able to get a whole gang of demons in the neighbors all around, so that the boys are trapped when they finally come into the house where the girl is living. And at the very last minute when Sam is going to kill her he is stopped by Dean who is able to feel demons since he is minutes away from Hell. Lilith in fact is in the body of Ruby who is possessed twice and since the boys do not have the special colt they can't kill the spirit Lilith in Ruby. The spirit keeps them at bay till midnight when the Hounds of Hell are introduced to get Dean away. She is so powerful she can keep Sam at bay against the wall but at the last minute the spirit Lilith goes away leaving Dean in Hell, Sam beaten up against the wall and Ruby with no good sense left in her. End of the season. Let's wait for the next one to revive the good Dean.But there is even more in this season that prepares the next season. They get rid of Gordon, the black hunter and some of his acolytes, all of them black except one. They have decided that psychic people like Sam have to be executed straight away and they have already executed a few. But Gordon will end up a vampire and Sam will behead him with a good old thick cable just as if it were a butter wire cutting up a block of soft butter. Altogether at least four Sam-hunters are eliminated, three of them black. If that is not a bias or maybe a prejudice, what is it then? Once again with these Sam-hunters or hunters of psychic people we have a case of their nave feeling they are doing a good thing when they are only doing what seems to them the only right they can do, though they are trying to destroy the only person who can save them, save humanity.At the same time another black character is redeemed, Special Agent Victor Henricksen, who is possessed. He arrests the two boys on a lead given to him by Bela who is escaping with the Colt. But a whole gang of spirits arrive and start killing people around the police station. The demon in Victor makes him shoot the Sheriff but he is kind of forcefully taken under control by the boys who had managed to get a crucifix and had made some water holy. And the boys exorcise the demon out of him. It is then Victor is redeemed and they organize the siege and the trap that will kill all the demons inside as soon as they are trapped using an infernal contraption: the intercom of the station that broadcasts the exorcising ritual formula. Brilliant. He let the two boys go, but they will learn later with Ruby on TV that the Demon Lilith, possessing a little blonde girl (evil can be everywhere and come in all forms) came herself afterward to get some vengeance and she destroyed the police station into ashes on the ground killing all those inside and close to it, including of course the redeemed FBI Special Agent. Isn't that sad? The two boys have it more and more difficult to save one person and when they do then the demon kills a dozen outsiders and innocent bystanders. But the redemption of Victor Henricksen, Special Agent by profession, is good news after all since that one was saved before being destroyed. His soul will go where it should and that is not in hell.The last remark I would like to make on this series is the great number of allusions to other classics in the field. The Shining by Stephen King is so often alluded too that I will not even specify. Come with me, Come with me, come with me, and you will know. Of course you also have Clive Barker at the end. But you have so many others like the Night of the Living Dead and in a way Michael Jackson's Thriller, If you do have some time and energy left when you have finished watching the next three seasons I would advise you to go back and identify them all. And that's where plagiarism is not what it used to be. Plagiarism used to make pale imitations of real stuff with tit bits stolen here and there, like Canada Dry instead of Whisky and ginger ale instead of real ale. We could of course think of the fake Frankenstein's monster who is the doctor himself and who has become immortal by substituting in his own body the parts that are getting old. Mad scientist, mad doctor, or whatever. There are so many of them running loose and free around in the street. Aren't you afraid of going out to smoke your cancer stick in the yard? I would be if I were you. You might be snatched by two moths from out space. Plagiarism you said? The pleasure is not plagiarized though.I will not insist on the debate between the two brothers and the love that becomes at times dense and impressive, but also at times pathetic and our empathy for the death of the elder brother is wearing out, especially since we know there are three more seasons to go and a fourth one running right now. But the car is also less present in this season. Sam has his own, by the way, and the Impala seems to have been reduced to a gadget in these episodes. It is present for sure, but certainly less than before. I hope it is not for long because I like the machine. The car seems to be less present since their future as a pair of hunters is compromised. They own the car together and it brings them together. The car being their only real possession, something they inherited from their father and that created a unity in their family, keeping them close and bringing them from one point to another together. On the trail leading to Dean's death, the car cannot keep them together or close, because one will surely die and the other is trying to save him by following new paths to save him, sometimes in ill-advised directions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE",Positive
"These were the highlights of this one for me:1. Details of Carson's early life and the experiences that may have motivated him to host a television show. There is evidence his need for approval may have come from a mother whose approval he sought - but never quite felt he received. There is also a fascinating timeline of Carson's first television shows, not all of them successful. He was, of course, in the right place at the right time and able to take advantage of television's first days.2. Interviews with other comedians as well as those connected to the Tonight Show (Ed McMahon, Doc Severinsen). It was both interesting and touching to hear the admiration and awe from people like Dave Letterman, Jay Leno, Ellen DeGeneres, and so many others who credited Carson with paving the way for them - as well as being the benchmark for excellence.3. Clips from the Tonight show as well as other programs featuring Carson. I did wish some of the clips were longer or showed the full segment, including a hilarious one where Carson is surprised by a baby orangutan and another where Doc Severinsen discusses Thanksgiving plans with Carson. Both deserved to be seen in their entirety, instead of as excerpts. So I'm deducting a star for that.Both diehard Carson fans and those who want to know more about him should find this worth watching.",Positive
"This series just tries to be witty by playing on tired old stereotypes. Dull, no insight, puerile. There are so many better things to watch these days.",Negative
My 3 year old great granddaughter loves this show and watches it on the Kindle before bed.  She never seems to get tired of it.,Positive
The best and most entertaining program yet on Kindle Fire.,Positive
"The program is not about dreams but about reincarnation. Two young boys have inexplicably strange obsessions and horrific nightmares, describing events they could not have possibly witnessed or been exposed to. One child claims his name is something like Peter, seems to understand German, makes drawings of WWII fighter planes and of evacuating children from a war zone. On the forth of July, he is terrified by fireworks and leaping on his mother begs her to keep her head down. The other child keeps saying he has to go to Hollywood where he works, claims his name is something other than it is, tells his mother, Jennifer, that Jennifer is his daughter's name and says that he was born on a different date than his birthday.Through patient research and excavation, both sets of parents identify who the children may have been in former lives. Intriguing and thought provoking.",Negative
"Well, it's no 'House of Cards'---I think it's great amazon.com is branching out, but this show is soooo boring and unattractive...and full of old ugly men and stereotypes....Hello--'Doomberry' crawl out of your ivory towers, the American people have known for sometime that there is no two party system it's all one big oligarchy corporatist statist new world order. But sooo glad to be reminded of the paradigm; Republi-cate BAD, Demo-ican GOOD, soooo original---Thanks 'Doomberry', I forgot for a moment we are suppose to have a two party system, and most importantly that there was a difference-wow soooooo enlightening.....not. I'd rather watch the Dr RonPaul Channel or 'BreakingBad' or 'GoT' for the nineth time then this dated crap.  Anyway, Keep trying amazon, I think overall you have a better selection than Netflix; can't wait til GoT season 4 is available.",Negative

"Thank goodness that a good space opera series is still being made.They really try to put out a quality show with stargate atlantis.This series may not be as exciting as season 3 overall but it's still agood show and well worth watching. I do think it was a mistake toremove the head of atlantis; the dr. wier character from the show, just as removing  Dr. Becket character from the previous series was not the best move in my opinion.  Still it takes guts to remove major characters and the Samantha Carter character does a good job at being the bases new leader. She has to let the others do most of the work though as she mainly runs the base.  I still loved the show though due to it's overall quality and fine acting so it's worth watching for even non stargate fans who enjoy good sci fi that is very well made.",Positive
"Although there have been comparisons to Blair Witch (pfft) and even Cloverfield, those movies fell well short of expectations whereas this one excelled. The characters are all quite engaging and believable, and the plot is believable, in a fictitious sort of way. There are so many underlying messages about government and society (at least as pertains to Norway specifically, but to the world at large as well), that i wont even bother regaling you with my views there. Suffice to say that this movie doesnt rely on unseen foes and hidden agendas. You actually see the trolls, and bare witness to the protagonists dealing with the situations, as a college filmcrew finds, then follows, then joins with an official government troll hunter/preservationist. Kind of a zookeeper with much larger confines that sometimes has to become a hunter as well. I would definitely recommend watching this, unless you cant keep up with subtitles for some reason, in which case, you wont like this. However, it is my experience that within the first few minutes, you forget you're even reading them as you become completely engaged with the story. Watch this movie...and enjoy!",Positive
Great program for the family no sex bad language or real violence good family show you must watch from season 1 to understand,Positive
I've seen every episode except for season 14 and the beginning of 15 but trying to get up to date.  I stopped watching because Elliott Stabler is gone now but still is a great show.  Wish he would come back!,Positive
"Let's be honest no first season is a five star, but this is close. The acting is rough, and some of the tech jargon is gibberish (trust me I'm a programmer). The story is a bit disjointed and hard to follow at times. The character development is slow but coming along.",Positive
good show.,Negative
"Lots of cliches and stereotypes in the pilot.  Is this an &#34;after&#34; event borrowed from Revolution?  Is this purgatory borrowed from Lost?  Who knows?  I go back and forth as to whether or not I even care.  It could improve dramatically--but if it stays stuck in this back and forth, cliche, stereotype warp, I would give up after a couple of episodes.",Negative
Awesome!!! I can't wait to see what will happen next. I wasn't a big kevin bacon fan but I am now.,Positive
"and a great cast, it's remarkable how the show has taken off and the characters developed from the elmore leonard story &#34;fire in the hole&#34;.  am looking forward to season 5.",Positive
"It reminds me of a car wreck.  You don't really care to see it but you can't turn away.  It's funny,  sometimes a fact is brought up that little know,  but you have to wonder why anyone thought a show with drunks giving history lessons would be a hit.  Still it's entertaining; weirdly and wrongfully so.",Negative
Characters were very believable and funny. loved the rookie VS  GM Scene. Hope Amazon continues this Sports comedy. Good acting,Positive
at first i didn't think it would be a good show but it is an awesome show i like the story lines they have done so far and the little hints here and there as they mentioned what happens in the new Captain America movie any for any Marvel fan out there and even if your not it's a good show to watch,Positive
"Ryan Gosling is among my favorite actors and I thought he was brilliant as the bizarre David Marks.I did not like this movie probably because it's based on a true story and it's very disturbing andalarming.  I thought Kirsten Dunst was okay and Lily Rabe was excellent.  Having researched this storybefore watching the film, I still was not prepared for how difficult emotionally I would find it to be.",Negative
"The story itself been done before, what they have done is introduced a mystery that will keep you interested though the movie.The acting is good. The characters are interesting. The dialogue is not particularly good.The filming is good enough but do not expect any brilliant special effects as there is none.If you are into soft zombie movies that are a bit clever, then most this is for you.",Positive

"One of the side effects of Amazon instant video, is that if an installment of my guilty pleasure tv program is missed, I can buy it and watch it at my leisure.  And besides, if it is too outrageous to be believed, I can watch it and shake my head in dismay all over again.  This is why I am pleased with the episode availability ofReal Housewives of New Jersey.  I can't believe they are real, but thanks to Amazon, there is solid proof.The quality is excellent, the color is good, and the attitudes and activities are a whole world away from my pleasent, happy, humdrum life.",Positive

"Just about the time that I thought just about every possible variant on the TV cop/detective/crime solving show had been explored by the creative geniuses who provide our nightly broadcast television ration of pap, piddle and trivia -whoa - here came a show that tickled our Sherlock Holmesian/forensic knowledge fancy.  Whoever would have thought that poking around with microscopes and spectrum analyzers and picking up little bits of fluff at a Los Vegas crime scene with a set of tweezers could be interesting? But yes, it was and has continued to be for going on eight seasons now and has given rise to a couple of variants set in New York and Miami. All three of the CSI iterations offer a distinct challenge to a viewer who possesses a decent ration of curiosity about puzzles and mysteries but a very, very low gross-out threshold. CSI season 7 mercifully let up a little on the really gross visualizations and focused a little more on the puzzles. Nothing I watched this season sent me gagging from the room, so either they let up or I have gotten a little more used to maggoty corpses.Three of the special features in this collection focus specifically on episodes which made season 7 stand a little apart. The first is  a `making of'  ""Built to Kill"" a two part episode set backstage at the astonishing Cirque d Soliel, another covers  the definitive stunt-casting of all time;  Roger Daltry playing five different guest parts in ""Living Legend"".  And a third extra feature focused on the hunt for the ""miniature"" killer, which continued intermittently all though the season. I found the ""Miniature Murders"" feature to be especially fascinating, as I had built many inch-to-a-foot scale model interiors and buildings. Having a series of perfectly replicated half-inch-to-a-foot murder scenes showing up within hours of a real, full-sized murder offered a puzzle to Grissom and his crew that lasted all season. Very obviously, it would have taken an artisan of miniatures days and weeks to build such a detailed replica, and the feature made it very clear what a challenge it was, even with the resources available to a television studio. Other extras include commentary tracks for seven episodes, and a tour of the real CSI-Las Vegas offices; which, astonishingly enough, are very much more cluttered and not nearly as plush-looking as the series sets.",Negative
"Herccule never disappoints withnhis &#34;little grey cells&#34; but I love watching the settings which are put together with such care as to be as close as possible to the real thing.  The clothes,hair, trains, cars, jewelry--all are perfect.",Positive
"Well, I really liked it! Definitely had me wanting to watch more episodes!This is another animated Amazon Pilot that would be just as at home on Comedy Central's Adult Swim block of programming. I think it's a good niche to exploit and should offer them a good entertainment return on the investment.The show sort of strikes me as a mix between Ugly Americans and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. That's a good thing.This pilot, unlike some of the other Pilot's commissioned by Amazon, would serve as a worthy first episode with out any need to be reworked in any way.I definitely hope they pick this one up!",Positive
Lots of action and surprisingly good acting. I've enjoyed every episode. If you like comic book entertainment I recommend watching the series.,Positive
"LOVE this show. Sad to see it end. The whole season is excellent, but I only buy a show here and there, because my AT&T DVR goes to hell and I have to get caught up intermittently.",Positive
"Abby is an absolute egotistical monster and sooooo very entertaining. I think the dancing is okay. It's little girls. Not my cup of tea although I admire their efforts and toughness. Abby would have destroyed me as a kid. I had a vocal coach who nearly did. Anyway, I love the fighting. What can I say?",Positive
"Must watch from the beginning...good story line and great actors..if you like history and detectives, you will love this..series...modern times.",Positive
"Where to even begin with this? For starters, I guess I could say that while it is nice that females are getting leads in comedies, it is sad that Elizabeth Banks, quite a talented actress, is saddled with this kind of unfunny crap. There were some funny moments, like the opening credits, but it was all downhill from there. The plot has the thinnest of conceits: a local news anchor loses out on a job offer, and goes partying with her girlfriends. Afterwards, she meets a guy who she goes home with and after waking up, she begins her &#34;walk of shame&#34; to try and get back to her job on time. Having such a thin story acts as a double-edged sword. It means we aren't saddled with a lot of narrative detours, but it also means that there really isn't much time for character development. And once the plot kicks in, it's just a series of comic set-pieces, a few of which work, but most of which don't. Oftentimes, the humor they were going for was too awkward and bordered on creepy. They also gave away a lot of the best jokes in the trailer. At the end they try to make up for all of it by having Elizabeth Banks' character give a speech about how it's wrong to assume a girl is a whore based on what she wears. Still, it wasn't enough to erase 80 minutes of racial stereotypes and misogyny (as well as some momentary gay stereotypes). Overall, this movie was about as clich&eacute; as you can get. It was largely devoid of laughs, which is very bad for a supposed &#34;comedy.&#34; No need to shame yourself by watching this garbage, even for the few laughs it did provide.",Negative
"This season of five episodes starts off with a complex plot: a detective who is retired is writing a book about his old cases, all of them successfully resolved, but one.  He is killed, and the chapter goes missing.  As Morse and Lewis dig deeper and deeper, several possible suspects emerge as to who might like to keep the information quiet, and who has the most to lose if the secrets are uncovered regarding the circumstances surrounding the crime and why it was never resolved.These shows may seem slow-moving compared to current mysteries, but the magic is in the script and acting.  Morse always has wise observations and his face is a joy to watch as John Thaw underplays the subtle emotions.",Positive
In this season Vic is trying to be as good as he can and not pull his usual crooked methods. The writing is still very good for an adult show. while my wife does not like the show I am enjoying every episode........when she is gone.,Positive
The humor and beautiful sunny setting makes the sometimes gruesome subject matter less gruesome.Looking forward to finding out the outcome in the next season.,Positive
"The original idea for the series wasn't particularly novel but the execution was pretty sharp. The first series was worth watching - tightly scripted, nicely directed, the actors not too wooden. But the second series rapidly deteriorated into the stock North American Soap Standard with a drawn-out master plot, lots of small sub-themes (many of which failed to be developed adequately) and worst of all, the old clich&eacute; of key characters being related to each other. What is it with North American soaps? Why does everyone have to be related to everyone else? It's boring, trite, and doesn't advance the storyline at all. By the end of the second series we have too many characters with too many sub-plots and not enough primary interest. So what could have been a nice tight series has degenerated into a long-drawn-out morass simply because writers get stale, ideas get recycled (I suppose it counts for ""green eco-consciousness"" to re-use second-hand plot lines and character arcs...), and the whole thing becomes very tedious indeed. Sadly what could have been a nice series has become very predictable, very boring, and without sufficiently interesting lead characters to compel anyone to stick with it. Watch the first few episodes of the first series and then pretend it was cancelled - that way you'll have enjoyed the best and avoided the worst.",Negative
"I really liked Endeavor Morse best.  But because I like the English police crime solvers, I also thoroughly enjoyed Inspector Lewis & his sidekick.  Really fun to watch.",Positive
Too bad I did not find this show until years after it was canceled.  They make me feel almost normal.,Positive
"I love this show. The balance of characters and great story writing make this one a winner. In my book, second only to Breaking Bad.",Positive

"I think it was the hat that made me shrug off the thought of watching The Blacklist at first. But I had a little time over a weekend and decided to take in a show. Then another. And so on.I was thoroughly entertained. Lock away the need to analyze plot for 48 minutes, and you may find The Blacklist--and James Spader--fun to watch.",Positive
"""Echoes"" is the seventh episode of Joss Whedon's ""Dollhouse"" and it has, to me, a different feel than the previous episodes. I strongly recommend you watch these in order since the back-story and plot lines build from episode to episode.No plot spoilers from me: The main story involves a dangerous situation on college campus that requires the use of most of the ""Actives"", except for ""Echo"". Still, ""Echo"" manages to be central to the plot and we learn a lot more about her back story. This was an odd episode that shows us a different side of the ""Dollhouse"" residents.Recommended!CFH",Positive
I've watched a bunch of the Amazon Prime Pilots and this was by far the best! Haven't laughed that hard out loud in a long time.,Positive
"There is something about this season that doesn't work for me... the setting all seem low budget, in studio. The fight scenes are worse than any previous season. No attention is being put into making the world feel real, but instead reads like a bad Marvel series...oh no...the end of the world.  Again.",Negative
"if for no other reason, select this season and admire oscar in all his glory! this man's smile will break hearts around the world...",Positive
The first season characters are back with a few additions. The back stores of each character continue to come out with some surprises. As before the stories are tight and it is a challenge to watch a single episode and not continue immediately to the next.,Positive
"My husband and I both really liked Bosch!  Its rare for us to find a tv program where we both get what we are looking for - action for him, a good story line for me, and great acting for us both.

"Let's put it this way, back in the late 60's there was a Lee Marvin/Angie Dickinson film called Point Blank about a guy who gets double crossed and left for dead in a warehouse after a successful heist and his gang betrays him.  It was about revenge and was one of the best Lee Marvin films I ever saw.  Then in the 1999 it was remade with Mel Gibson and Maria Bello as Payback and was an even bloodier telling of more or less the same story, but with less classicism about it.  It was just good but not Point Blank, however, it did present us with the talents of Ms. Lucy Liu, who was absolutely sadistically hilarious as a crazy, violent, dominatrix.  That is why I remember the film.  Now they have remade it with Jason Statham and Jennifer Lopez and guess what?  It is almost as good as Point Blank.  There are some updates to the story and new characters thrown in but Parker is still the same characters with the same moralistic views and I have to admit that Statham is grand in the part.  It's a triumph for him because for once it isn't all about his fighting skills and relies more on his acting chops.  Lopez is fine too as she is no longer trying to play the cute rom-com hottie and admits to approaching 40 with a lousy success rate.  When she makes a play for Statham and realizes he's not interested she just shrugs it off like she expected he'd reject her and still remains loyal and accepts his friendship.  I like it when women play real women, kind of like Olga Kurylenko rejecting James Bond in Quantum of Solace because she had other aims to accomplish as did James.  Parker is a very good film and since no one has tried to restore or clean up the print of Point Blank, which is horrendously damaged (at least the print I saw recently), it's the only way to see one of the best heist/revenge film made today.  Also, included is some of Statham's and Lopez's best performances.",Positive

"I've never been a big fan of Eli Roth. I know many think of him as the new face of horror but most of his movies to me have amounted to minor of the plot/story with a focus on the gore. I have no problem with gore in movies, but gore for gore's sake gets boring after a while and for me most of his films have been that, boring. So when I heard his name connected with this film I viewed it with trepidation. Once I found out he wasn't directing I felt better. In the end, we have a decent movie here that offers some chills along the way from start to finish.The movie takes place in Chile where three friends (one played by Roth who gets a co-writing credit on the film too) and business partners are enjoying the night life that the city they're in has to offer. One of the three is Chilean so he speaks the language. Moving from club to club, night spot to night spot, the three end up connecting with three women and the six of them carry on with the partying. So much for about 30 minutes of the film. It's not quite enough time to make us care about the group or perhaps it's the antics that involve them but when things change we care.While in one of the clubs a huge earthquake hits and panic follows. The required amounts of gore and blood flow as people are crushed beneath the columns and pillars that decorate the club they're in. One of the friends has his arm crushed and as the group gets out they begin to search for the nearest hospital. When they hit the streets the amount of devastation confronts them as they roam the city seeking help while dealing with the looting and rioting that follow each aftershock.But that's not enough jeopardy to put this group in. Someone mentions that there was a prison nearby that housed the worst of the worst, the nastiest killers the country had to offer. So on top of trying to find help and dealing with the wreckage around them they now must try and decipher who is safe to trust and who might be one of these mentally disturbed prisoners.This adds a nice touch to what could have been a rather standard disaster film. The group does their best to make it through but along the way is hunted down by the escaped prisoners. Just who will and won't make it through the night becomes the question that follows them from street to street. As would be expected, not all of them will survive. Who does and doesn't adds to the suspense (limited though it may be) and moves the story from point A to point Z. All would be fine with the exception of the ending (which I won't spoil but saw coming a mile away), which makes this film a part of the sort of movie Roth would make. If you don't understand that comment I won't ruin the ending for you.Not great acting but passable, some decent gore effects and a well shot film. The story moves along at a snails pace to start but picks up once the earthquake hits. If you're not a fan of Roth then there is one piece in this you will love. On the whole this is a movie worth watching if you like disaster or horror films. If you don't like either or are planning a trip to Chile, I'd pass this one by.",Negative
Great show. You get hooked on the characters. Really like the hard work values and laid back ways of this bunch.,Positive
"Ok, here's the premise.  Hank the ER doc has two emergencies.  He lets the poor kid live & the fat rich guy die.  End of career you say?  Well, yes, in the big city hospital but Hank's bro Evan whisks him off for a weekend jaunt in the Hamptons.  Here they finagle an invite to a high end Par-Tay & he proceeds to use his newfound Jungle Medicine Powers on a party goer.The brothers are invited to stay in the guest house of a rich enigmatic German who Hank refers to as your typical Bond villain - probably because of the shark tank in the basement.  The brother Evan is a CPA who's always looking for an available female and/or a new rich client for HANK/MED, the medical corporation he's set up.  This starts the trip down the newfound life path as a concierge doctor to the rich.A great assortment of offbeat medical emergencies present themselves each week from upper respiratory infections presenting at a dog's Bark Mitzvahs to tracking devices hidden in boobie implants by jealous hubbies.  Hank meets each riddle with aplomb and MacGyver tactics.I think Hank may be too serious & Evan too foolish but they play off each other well and the result is a believable sibling rivalry.  The entire cast is first rate with a big thumbs up to the PA Divya a beautiful Indian actress who lends reality to the whole medical scenario.I really like this show; it's a fresh and unique medical drama that steps out of the genre.  I'd recommend it to all.",Positive
"Great voices, story, animation, humor. I SO want this to be a regular show! Haven't been this jazzed about a show for awhile now.",Positive
"Castle has been one of my &#34;go-to's&#34; since cable cutting.Basically, Castle is a writer of mystery novels, got involved with the cops, when a murderer started mimicking murders from his novels, found Kate Beckett and spent the next 4 seasons chasing tail, until he finally caught up to her in season 5.I had worried that it would lose it's momentum after the relationship tension abated, but to date they've managed to keep it all going and fairly intelligently.  It's gone through phases, completely secret relationship, only close friends (not management) knows, up to season 6 where's it's all pretty much public.You get a murder, a gross murder scene and most times a decent mystery of sorts.  Characters interactions are well written and at some points priceless (season 5 &#34;Undead again&#34;, one of my favorite episodes).There is some diversion where they break from the formula.  Season 6, beginning, Beckett winds up getting a job in Washington and the supporting cast for the most part gets left behind.  BUT, they've since sorted that out and the episodes are &#34;decent&#34; this season.  I have hopes that it's on the upswing, so sticking with it.Lord knows how many times I've watched some of these episodes (my son has started throwing objects at me when I repeat the dialogue along with the episode.... so, there's that).A bit gross at times, but good humor, good mystery and seldom gets too full of itself.",Positive
Not sure about this one. I'd have to see a couple more episodes. The pilot has me curious but didn't grab me. I felt I was in between the Twilight Zone and Lost.,Positive
I give this show five stars because it continues to entertain!  So much material out right now simply forgets the objective.  I wasn't sure they would be able to pull it off with the rather &#34;out there&#34; story line.  They are pulling heavily from the character development investments made in the first two seasons.  Good thing!!  It keeps the show entertaining.,Positive
"We absolutely love the entire Breaking Bad series. It is a great mix of drama and suspense. Beware, it is highly addicting, even if you think you'd have no interest in the show! It truly sucks you in... The final series did not disappoint, but we are sad it's over!",Positive
"This wonderful series and the people in it just gets better and better. The writers have rounded out the character development of each  personality by this fourth season so that viewers can either love or hate them with vigor. Wishing this exciting program would never end is not realistic, but I do! It does not stay confined to a few locations, but we travel the world over in beautiful and rather horrible scenery and settings the average person would never see or set foot in. Congratulations to the makers and stars of this absolutely fine program!",Positive
Continues to deliver funny episodes season after season of clean and wholesome fun:)  we love watching this show every week and can't wait for more episodes,Positive

My husband and I enjoyed watching these shows after my daughter-in- law and granddaughter recommended them. I think they are watch worthy.,Positive

I like the cast of the show. I like that the show is not over-the-top. The show moves at a good pace. I like the humor.,Positive
"In what appears to make an attempt to be 'Lost 2014' this show is somewhat of a let down.  First off, folks so easily accepted that there were suddenly thrust into &#34;the end of all things&#34; yet the still clamored over cash money, electronic devices with no way to power them and silly conversation.What a disaster of a pilot from Chris Carter, the mastermind behind X-files.",Negative
"Another excellent production from the FX network. Margo Martindale walks away with it just as she did in Justified. The issues raised, and the very fact that issues are raised, makes this well worth watching.",Positive
"Witty, funny, both the casting and the acting complement the well developed characters. The directing is exceptional as well.Enjoy....",Positive
"This pilot was entertaining, but music and art are not my thing.  I could see liking this as a movie or mini series, but not as a full show.  Where would the plot even go?",Negative
Love this show.  Can't get enough of it.  I want Olivia and Nick to get together.  Still wish Stabler was on it but it still an excellent show even without him.  Love all the crime and drama.,Positive
"This is a real fast pace exciting, Oh Wow Drama, I cant believe it. I was not real excited about it at first. it moves really fast and sometimes I had to rewind to figure out what the heck was being said. I'd be like &#34;WHAT?&#34; but I am additcted. I just love it. it is wild and make you wonder..... really wonder....",Positive
"It's a funny show if your into funny bathroom comedy, The characters are great in this show...Im still watching and laghing",Positive
Gets more and more crazy each season.  I'm watching this with someone else and I'm not always laughing when they are.  It can cause you to be squeamish if you are not into people choosing to do things that are not actually 'by the book'.,Positive
I was very young when this show was aired on television.  Now I can appreciate the humor and the cleaner programs of that era.  Not quite as funny as some of the other programs of that day; but you'll still get a laugh.,Positive
"This show didn't remind me of the books i've read from the past, yet when I found myself negative, this show brought a calming effect that allowed me to choose to feel something else.  I can't think of any other show that has done that in such an innocent way. Pleasant surprise, can't wait for another season.",Positive
enjoy it all the way the characters remain episode one after another. Wish I wasn't charged for every one would rather pay a one time fee.,Positive
interesting characters and stories.,Positive
Great show absolutely love this series I hope it continues to stay this good. I would love for this show to stay on for years to come.,Positive
They did a good job recreating the show.  I am glad to have just got in through Amazon since not sure what a movie screen would have done..  Obviously sets up a possible 2nd movie depending on how much it makes.,Positive
"This is an amazing Tv Show, one of my favorites. This series is very exiting and interesting. If you like science fiction genres then you will love this show, Just try it out and You will love this show.",Positive
"These dramatized documentaries are murder mysteries that really occurred. If you are interested in this topic, they will entertain you.",Positive
"The actors are attractive and wooden. Good series for adolescents who are more into clothes, cars, gadgets, and romance, with a now-and-then bloody fight to break the monotony. As to &#34;Arrow&#34; himself: I am reminded of a review of Talullah Bankhead in Cleopatra: &#34;She displayed the gamut of emotion from A to B.&#34;",Negative
I so enjoy it and get caught holding my breath at times afraid of what will happen or I will get happy when things are positive,Positive
Looks very promising. Definetely one of the better cop show episodes I've seen in a while......Love that Titus Welliver finally got a lead role..... great actorAmazon Studios should make this and keep the quality as high as in the pilot,Positive
"Unfortunately, The Walking Dead is no longer must see TV.  It is feeling recycled these days.  The music track has improved however.  I am just not sure it is worth paying 2.99/episode though.",Negative
"interesting from the start. i am not typcially a fan of any sort of cop show, but this one was so good i cannot wait for the next episode. bought the season pass before it was even half over.the writing here is particularly good for network tv. this show could easily have been on hbo. i just hope nbc doesnt drop the ball on this one. judging from the rest of the slate available so far, this is the only one that isnt insulting and stupid. indeed its grand, nuanced and wonderful. and as i said, very very smert.",Positive
"USA knows how to do summer television right. With hits like Psych and Burn Notice, it's difficult for the network to do any wrong. After tackling different sides of the law, USA decided to take on the unique and fascinating world of white-collar crime in their exciting new comedy police procedural White Collar.In White Collar viewers meet con man Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer), a sophisticated white-collar thief who has finally been put behind bars by his archnemesis CIA Special Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay), an agent in the white-collar crime division. Just months before his parole comes up, Neal escapes from prison to track down his ex-girlfriend, Kate (Alexandra Daddario). Peter hunts him down, but finds that Neal may be helpful when it comes to solving white-collar crimes. After solving their first case together, Neal joins up with the CIA as a consultant and works with Peter to fight white-collar criminals.The centerpiece of the series is the hilarious relationship between Neal and Peter and the way they play off one another - basically bickering like an old married couple. Though I admit this relationship feel somewhat strained in a few episodes, it cleans up as the show goes on and the actors become more comfortable with the characters. Aside from Neal and Peter, the eccentric, quirky Mozzie (Willie Garson) constantly battles the pair for attention on scene and, honestly, occasionally wins. Garson's whimsical delivery and throughly developed character is one of the highlights of the show, and it'll be interesting to see how he continues to develop. Of course, you can't forget 90210 alum Tiffani Theissen as Peter's wife Elizabeth. Though she seems weak aside from some of the other characters, she's not the typical TV CIA wife and grows into her own lively character as the season goes on.Unlike the popular prime-time franchise CSI, White Collar focuses on sophisticated, high-end crimes such as art theft, forgery, fraud and embezzlement rather than violent crimes of passion.This allows for a fresh type of feel to police procedurals, rather than chasing criminals around New York or LA after discovering a murder, Neal and Peter put their heads together to unravel complex, sophisticated crimes that take a few more brain cells than the average murder.This three disc set is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound, but only in English. Subtitles are available in English, French and Spanish.The bonus materials were pretty good for the first season of a new show that USA was taking a gamble on. They include DVD staples such as a gag reel and deleted scenes - my personal favorites - and a handful of features that include interviews with cast and crew and a discussion of the crimes that inspired the episodes ""Pro and Con,"" ""A Cool Cat in the Hat,"" and ""Nothing But the Truth.""White Collar is another wonderful series from USA that breathes a refreshing summer breeze into some exciting television. If you haven't see the first season, you should pick it up before diving into season two, or else you'll miss some important plot points. Don't let this white-hot summer series pass you by.",Positive
"A colleague asked that I view this season because there is an overlap in our specific medical interests. With heroine addiction as in other types of substance abuse, there is decreased ability in the body's immune system and infectious disease becomes more difficult to treat. I very much doubt that I would be able to accomplish what she does with interventions. There seems to be so much darkness before there can be light again . . . if  death doesn't intervene! Yes, I do understand addiction and the absolute need for intervention and treatment. Diagnosing an infectious disease process for substance abusers requires treating both conditions . . . it's the same body/mind. It was past difficult to observe that one intervention and this is certainly an accurate portrayal of the 'real' one.Recommended? That's a good question that I don't have a glib answer for . . . those considering an intervention? Substance abusers? Those interested in human behavior? Perhaps one episode if you are interested in finding a few answers to your own questions.I've viewed 'Chasing The White Dragon,' 'The Global Addiction,' 'Afghanistan: The Opium Trail,' and 'One Man's Seduction.'  If you have an interest in grower to user, 'The Global Addiction' is a 30 min overview by ABC Australia, that is well narrated and reasonably accurate.[Season 10 review]",Negative
This show is very good and exciting. Love the way the characters interact. Funny how all different types of people are drawn in.,Positive
Two guys bringing their special skills and unique perspectives to the law office.  I like the twists and turns of the relationship.,Positive
"The series started out OK, but after three episodes, I lost interest. Hard to figure out just what the point is and how the characters interact. Not much suspense, particularly at end of episodes to keep the viewer coming back. Yawn.",Negative
"Honestly, I think Clara Danes is beautiful. My wife died about 6 years ago and Clara looks like her. Pathetic I know, but in a weird way it's like having her back for 60 minutes. The storyline is excellent, I'm ex military and find it somewhat insulting at times. Things aren't what the TV says, it ain't like that. They freaking hate us with a passion I have never seen before. So I'm on our side.",Positive
This here is the best neo-noir hard-boiled postbellum/western detective show ever conceived and produced ... and (almost all) the girls are real purdy too.  I'm proud to have watched every episode.,Positive
"The talented ensemble cast is essential in keeping the show interesting. The show features the usual hardships of white, middle class life in suburban Berkeley, California. An autistic son, an unplanned pregnancy, divorce, single mother hardship, empty nest divorces. The reason I watch is because I care about the characters. The episodes are poignant and brilliantly acted.The directing and cinematography are very good, particularly for a network television program. The writing is crisp and authentic. Each character has a unique, resounding voice. Flawed and genuine, we keep watching, wishing our family had the kind of resolve the Braverman's have.The abundance of characters allows a smooth shifting between each life, allowing more realistic events to provide entertainment, drama and comedy. Single subject sitcoms, tend to require increasing melodrama to retain viewers. Not so with Parenthood. I can't stop watching.",Positive
"This was an enjoyable show. The script was good, acting good, lighting and sets good. I hope to watch it again.",Positive
"really i would have given a 4.25, but it was not an option. i am not a big fan of much on tv, but most of the time &#34;Bones&#34; leaves me happy i watched. Like the idea behind the story--brainy woman and macho man and their personal interactions. also like all the rest of the characters and the way they've been developed. very entertaining. often thought provoking. wonderful music. frankly i thought once bones and partner were married off the writers would be hard pressed to keep the story interesting. they have done very well and continue to make this story work.",Positive
"This is fun and light-hearted--needs some work, but over all has the potential to grow. Good, strong cast. Natalie Zea is a wonderful actress. If the writers veer away from clich&eacute;d story plots they will be able to create a fun comedy.",Positive
Extremely informative and captivating. You get a &#34;glimpse&#34; of what goes on behind the scenes in our government. True or not - I'll leave that up to you?,Positive
"Love this show. This is a TV show; can see characters and plot on a season-long show. Love Rory on here; can he say meow meow a bunch of times, pretending he is a cat? Check out the Todd Glass show. Well shot, well written and great acting. This is the next Office.",Positive
pure escapeis  sponly flaw is all the cursing and references to JESUS and GODwhy don't the writers ever use mohammad,Positive
This is such an excellent and intense season.I love Opie and I hate seeing him go through so much :(Watching jax and Tara's relationship unfold is pretty awesome too,Positive
"We love this show.  Last time we watched it, my ten year old grandson did not want to go home.  This is always a thrill.",Positive
picks right up from last season and if you liked Season 1 you will like Season 2 (so far at least),Positive
Not much to review. Quicker than expected delivery a plus.  And a great season of HIMYM.,Positive
"For a small British film this is just amazing and stands up to Hollywood movies any day, written by the talented Noel Clarke who also stars, the story is simple yet brilliant with a group of people stuck in a security storage facility after it locks down due to a power malfunction caused by a massive explosion in the middle of London, a military plane crashed carrying what turns out to be an alien, a deadly alien that likes human flesh. The entire cast is great, the effects are top notch, the monster effects are old school man in a suit but look awesome and very original and scary, there are a few cool gore moments and stand out scenes, this is a gem of a film and must be seen, if you love sci-fi then this will certainly bring a smile to your face especially the very last scene of the film. Brilliant!!",Positive
"Surprisingly entertaining movie, well made, good actors, good editing, appropriate music, etc. The story had a few unexpected twists, and the ending sets the stage for a sequel.",Positive
This show is a fresh way to go paranormal hunting. I have watched two seasons and have enjoyed each show.,Positive
I really like this series and can't get enough of it.  I love the interaction of the family.  Donnie Wahlberg is absolutely fantastic; he is completely believable.,Positive
"Okay ... when I had cable, I fixed it so my remote would NOT land on MTV.  I was sick of the creeps from New Jersey and the trashy pregnant teens or anyone turning 16.  This show was available for Free on Amazon Prime.  Who doesn't remember the awkward high school teenage years?  (I see you ... raise your hand)The very first show had the star female lead giving it up to the popular high school jock.  Awkward.  Eeuww.  It was a little creepy seeing the actor doing a pretty good job of being, let's say ... &#34;high schoolish&#34; -- eeuw.  BUT all that teenage activity comes with serious things to ponder for those in the teen group and the story ends with good angst-filled messages of being true to yourself, standing firm, and maybe not giving it up so easily.For the rest of us sophisticated, suave and not awkward adults -- you will enjoy the kooky and loveable adults on this show.  Hard to believe we've got a Mouseketeer from the Cristina/Britney/Justin era playing a mom to a teenager.  The high school counselor is a wacky, loveable, character.  The teen girl lead has a hunky, adoring and adorable dad.I was surprised that I loved the show -- it is on MTV.Cute, show.  I hope they don't mess it up in the new season!Do you have Amazon Prime?  Stop reading this and watch Awkward!",Positive
This version is more like the history of Batman.  It shows how he is developed into the hero he is and how the supporting characters factor into who he is as a person.,Positive
"Haven't watched all the episodes on this set yet, but they are as good the second time around as the first.",Positive
"Really like this show. Interesting crimes, great cop with his own issues even borderline tortured in his personal life. Real breath of fresh air after way too many cop shows from the u.s that always seem to deteriorate into some sort of relationship with the lead that takes over the show. He does have a nemesis which provides an interesting back story. Have since picked up a couple shows from bbc america since finding luther.",Positive
"Couldn't get past the obnoxious sitcom audience laughter. I mean, they pushed the button for ""laugh"" EVERY time someone said something.....Corny as hell. Still an Anna Faris fan though, but this show is some bulls***",Negative
"Season 3 of Storage Wars was yet another hit. If you like season 1 and 2, then you won't be disappointed with Season 3 as everything stays the same: characters, show's format, and of course the hard fast bids! The only things that is different is the storage lockers.The only thing I wish this show would do more of, which I think would make the show even better is have more characters on there. They need to have new characters or bring back some old ones. The regular cast is fine, but gets old. There is only one new character on the show this season, Jeff Jarrod. He got to be in 3 shows, but he quickly disappeared after that.If you love storage wars, then this season is a must see!",Positive
This is a charming story with wonderful characters and the delictdful Dorcas is beautifully done. I can't wait tk see where the story takes me in each episode. I hope BBC will continue thF story.,Positive
"The series was consistently entertaining if a slightly offbeat look at the Arthurian legend.  This year was the last for the series which fortunately either knew it was being canceled or planned on ending after five seasons and was able to plan the year's story arc accordingly.  Without revealing a ny spoilers, suffice to say the end was well done in context of the storyline the series had pursued.  Generally well acted, with reasonable special effects given a relatively spare TV budget (noGame of Thrones here) the series was quite enjoyable and if you have any interest in the period or in buddy films, you would enjoy this series and certainly year five.",Positive
Season 5 is yet another winning season for Theresa. I just adore these shows as an end of day treat!,Positive
"Suits embellishes the law with wit, charm, intrigue, and style (high-end fashion).Appealing to the passive as well as the aggressive, this fast-paced drama is the modern-day Perry Mason.One Black Eye - the show over-indulges in foul language.",Positive
"Derivative in the worst way, with a low budget look, cliche acting, and lazy editing. Wanted it to be good but.....",Negative
"Although I cannot say that I like it as much as the Last Airbender, it is still a five-starer.... We are all enjoying watching this as a family.  Each night one of us will say, 'let's watch just one more'...... You really enjoy the characters.  Good, clean fun entertainment.",Positive
"Great Sci-Fi, Well done visual effects. Can't wait for Season 4. Hopeful that the show will have a long run",Positive
"This film is an enigma to me.  It has terrific atmosphere.  The acting is uniformly excellent notably Eric Bana as a slightly unhinged stick-up man.  Ultimately it lies in the story which really isn't that compelling or even plausible.  I think that the end of the film where all the film's principles are gathered together, albeit on Thanksgiving Day, is pretty contrived and,yes, ludicrous.  All said, though, the film is certainly ambitious if not wholly successful.  Worth a watch but don't expect a thriller that has any resonance.",Negative
"To this day I still believe the 1st season is still the best season out of all the dexters. The future seasons tend to drag on too much and dexter doesn't get enough kills by taking out bad people from the world. The first season has nearly one bad person in each episode that dexter eliminates but as the season progresses to 2,3,4,5,6 etc you find that Dexter starts to get bored and is surrounded by so much life drama bull crap that he can't even kill anymore bad guys!",Positive
"The song they sing &#34;GO GO GO GO GO!&#34; from Race Around the World episode is part of her &#34;new talker&#34; repertoire. When they sing it...she sings it. It's very cute that among her first dozen words or so...she pulls many from songs that she hears, like some of the ones the Backyardigans sing.",Positive
"One can always depend on Jon to be topical and funny. His is the best satire on TV on a continuing basis. It's obvious that the &#34;Steve Corbert Show&#34; is influenced by this one, and often Steve is funnier than Jon is, but he also goes off on the deep end sometimes and is totally not funny. Jon Stewart rarely goes off of the track.",Positive
"Curious George has been a classic for years, however, I believe that the Curious George show is better than ever.  There is always a lesson hidden in these adorable episodes.  My son LOVES to watch it, and I am happy to let him watch.  They discuss topics from counting to instruments, colors, nature etc.  The graphics are wonderful and sharp, music is so cute!  I truly find myself singing the opening song with him&#8230;always! It is nice for our children to have shows that are fun, as well as educational.",Positive
Keeps my one year old entertained but not much more. There could be a little more education to the show.,Negative
"This show should have come back for a season 5. In fact it wasn't until the summer that we found out it was axed. It had dropped from 20 to 12 episodes. IT could have continued at 12 eps but that's the way it goes. So this show doesn't have a real ending , instead it has a good fourth season that is similiar to the other series and has the same cast. This is good sci fi with decent effects. In fact the show was a pioneer in special effects screen techniques. It did a great job for the budget it had.  Scy fy has axed many a great show including eureka. Which is shame also. Of course at this stage you probably have seen the first 3 series and if you haven't start with those blu rays or dvd sets.",Positive
"As usual, I'm really impressed with the way some of the truckers, most notably Lisa and Daryll, can get themselves out of anything the ice roads throw in their way, whether it's fixing their trucks on the road, getting themselves out of snowbanks, dealing with an oversized load heading towards a narrow bridge, or loading a cement mixer stuck in a parking lot. The contrast with some of the other drivers and between the two companies makes this season one to watch.",Positive
"This was actually much better than expected. Contrary to one review, I found the narration fast paced and interesting. The technical details are well presented and accurate. The tactical skills of the fighter pilot are graphically demonstrated and the original footage has been well chosen. If you are interested in technical details and tactics this is a well formatted docudrama. For those who are curious about the aura of the 'fighter ace,' this includes a psychological  profile. The description of the F-86 Sabre and the MIG-15 is accurate and includes manufacturing  details as well as maneuverability and equipment.  Worth the time to form your own conclusions.",Positive
"When the main character says &#34;I just want this to end&#34;,  boy did I agree with her.  Since she is french, I'll try to say it in french:  Qu'est ce qu'on charge de merde!Everything about this was awful.  From the idea to the writing to the acting.  This is an unoriginal, uninspired cross between the Walking Dead and the show where Ichabod Crane is in 21st C New England.  it also cleaves to convention heavily; the pilot plot was quite predictable.  Oh, wait:  was that seriously Peter Sarsgaard in there for a minute?  It is shocking to see an actor of his caliber in this tripe.  THAT was unpredictable.  Honestly, this wouldn't make it ten episodes on network TV.  And that french chick is so annoying I found it difficult to make it through even one episode.  Her acting is worse than my french.  Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.",Negative
I tried to like it but this comedy is anything but funny.  I didn't even like the trailer but I happen to like everyone of the cast members.  I just don't understand why none of the cast members ever ad libbed something funny every so often.  It would have kept my interest.  I held out as long as I could but got to a point where I could no longer waste my time watching.,Negative
"I just rented this with zero expectations.  It's actually hilarious not just for a low budget movie; some cgi but decent practical effects.  Same old apocalypse schtick (common in several movies) post-rapture where random asteroids are falling from the sky, locusts are yelling at you, crows are sexually harassing you, and satan lives in a mansion in seattle.If you can get past the ""blasphemy"" (and it is blasphemous) and like deadpan comedy (bizarre for the sake of bizarre) you'll probably find it very funny.  Most of the humor is deadpan so if you're not into that kind of comedy you're probably not going to like it.Of course ken jeong plays God because he's in everything!",Positive
I waited for 25 minutes for something to happen. Its like this show is trying to be edgy or trendy or appeal to &#34;hipster&#34; crowd. DO NOT....DO NOT make this show into a reality.,Negative
"Very good, enjoy probably a little more action but the shows the 60s, the sheriff and gangster excellent, hope it continues another season",Positive
This is one of the best programs I have watched in a long tome. When it started Annie had no gun but later she did and did some bed hopping I thought cheapened the program but will still watch,Positive
One of the best TV made series. War of the world has been one of my favorite Si-Fi movies so this got me right off. I has just enough special effects great acting and great plot. I am watching  season 2 for a second time getting ready foe season 3's start.,Positive
Two pills in pupils.....well maybe its not pills but Walt's back and badder than ever.  The first episodes are a little slow but I think it is a ramp up to a huge season with twists and roller coaster action.  Heisenburgs run isn't over yet.  But it won't boad well for him I think in the end.  If you get a chance to watch do IT!,Positive
"Loved the X-Files and was really hoping for another well-written show with great characters and great writing...this wasn't it. It's a bunch of unlikable people dropping the F-bomb every other word and making dumb decisions. The ending was definitely a shocker, but not enough here to bring me back.",Negative
"This is the most original and creative writing in television. But if you're easily offended, this is not the show for you.",Positive
"Stalked: Someone's Watching is a documentary ""true crime"" program produced by the Investigation Discovery network.  The first season, which premiered in 2011, features 6 episodes based on actual cases involving stalking.  The stories vary in scope and type, and although males are typically the perpetrators, stalkers of both genders are featured.Like other true crime programs, the episodes feature interviews with those involved, along with reenactments featuring actors.  The stories are usually concerned with strange, often obsessive behavior, and are somewhat interesting, as people can do some weird things.  Matters do not become extremely violent, but while it's available on Prime, those interested in true crime might want to see if this program has any appeal.",Negative
Enjoyable show with great storylines.,Positive
I am completely addicted to this show.  I can't wait to see the next episode.  Interesting to see the spin these writers put to our classic fairytales.,Positive
We bought a few favorite episodes and will probably buy the season when it comes out in full. We often use them traveling and sometimes at home. The show has been great. She has learned ALL her shapes and numbers from it. How many almost 2 year olds know a trapezoid when the see it? Or how to count to 100 by ones AND tens? The only downside is she can have a day when she overstresses about everything (toddler much?) and too many OH NOs from bot and it'll be time to stop it before she cries over nothing.,Positive
New subject matter leaving some new series in the dust.  Interesting concept but sure someone can master it.  Worth your time.,Positive
My 3-year-old liked this one a lot: from the colorful characters to the message about the value of art. He wants to see more of this!,Positive
"I don't know why the ratings are not higher but luckily they were high enough for another season!!!!!!!!!!! This show is a 6-8 season show for sure. Lots of REAL action (I was a cop a long time ago) and they got the streets pretty close :) Good acting, good story, pretty woman, tough guys but they all go perfectly together for the story.",Positive
I'd say this one comes in at number 4 in my daughter's top 5 shows. She can usually sit through an entire episode. She absolutely loves Boots.,Positive
"After the huge cliffhangers of the season 2 finale, season 3 seemed the beginning of an awesome season. This first part of season 3 is not the exception. Season 3 makes some big changes (for good), and the story just grows more and more with each episode. With this part of season 3, I felt like it was a little weaker comparing it to seasons 1 and 2, that had exciting episodes all the time, but I still think season 3 was solid enough to keep me entertained as a viewer, We get to meet new characters that have huge parts on the story (Kali, the twins, Jennifer, Cora), and that keep this season moving as we see the main characters dealing with new issues that come along with the new characters. The cast is definetely good. But I felt there wasn't enough Lydia until the last 5 or 4 episodes of the season. She needed more screen time! The Decaulion plot felt a little weak sometimes, but by the last episodes they finally give it the quality it needed since the beginning.But anyway, the quality of the series is still good, the plot twists and the little jokes are still there and overall, the show is so unpredictable. Can't wait to see what's going to happen on season 3B!",Positive
"Great writing, acting, cinemetography, editing, etc. Love good Swedish detective drama and now Maria Wern is topping my list. Hope Amazon gets more seasons and that they will be Prime eligible.",Positive
Love the show no violence just a real life show with kids playing foitball and a coach  with his family,Positive
House of Cards was/is better.  This is not the best written series I've ever seen.  It needs better actors. OK?,Positive
"I'm sorry in advance for being frank, but the cuteness of Maya Erskine and Margo Harshman hardly makes up for the ugly cast that makes up the rest of the actors, which made this hard to watch. And why did everybody's eyes look like they were about to burst out into tears? Also, this seems like the kind of series that would just keep dragging on and on. If it were a movie, it'd be fine - you'd watch it for 2 hours, and then it'd be over. But as a series, the plot just doesn't have the potential. Many will say that the road to commercializing an idea is a long and twisty one, and I don't disagree, but I just don't think it's one that would make good television; especially not as a comedy. The silly romantic interests of him and her are just a cliche attempt at distracting you from realizing that there isn't enough in the story alone to keep you entertained.",Negative
"I had read about this film and was glad to finally see it and own it on DVD. The story is based on a character created by Robert E Howard the man who released Conan the Barbarian on the public many years ago. Solomon never reached the heaghts of Howard's Barbarian tales but this film just may bring in enough interest in the stories for some to try and find them.The story deviates from the pulp source it came from, but the story is well told. It gives Solomon a back ground and purpose. The film is well put together and the cgi effects and make up are effective.James Purfoy is fine as the hero and brings a harsh quality that is needed in this character. All of the acting is top notch and the sets are also very impressive. My only quibble is the pacing was off and that slowed down the film in parts. Overall a rousing film worth taking a look at.Anchor Bay did their ussual solid transfer and sound on the dvd and I really enjoyed all of the extras. Commentary is something I always look forward to and enjoy.",Positive
We enjoyed the first two seasons and will enjoy the third and fourth as well.  We hope we will have more to come.Thank youThe Crosbys,Positive
I enjoyed the show. It was food for thought. It's uplifting to see what a groupis capable of under adverse  conditions.,Positive
"This has a fantastic story and actors who were made for the roles they played ... Although it is quite long, I've watched it several times - and will continue to!",Positive
"Love this show! So fun and funny. Characters are great and love the stories that usually end abruptly. The Ice King is so sad but funny - we love him. Kids can watch too but they won't get it all. I love having a cartoon to watch that is something besides The Simpsons or Family Guy. I like those shows, but some of the humor can get to me after so many episodes. Not so with Adventure Time. Also like two short episodes within each show, which is much more like the cartoons of old. What time is it? Adventure Time!!!",Positive
I'm awaiting this TV series Grimm S-2 so I cannot review something I have not received. Sorry but show me later after I get the series two.,Positive
I've really enjoyed this show. It has a great story line and is different from most shows out there. I love the characters. I hope they put all of the seasons on prime,Positive
"AH, English comedies. I may be sucker for period pieces but this series from 1983 (I think) matches 2 great English actresses, Geraldine McEwen and Prunella Scales.Miss McEwen went on to appear as one ofthe Miss Marple's in Agatha Christie's stories on Masterpiece Mystery. And Prunella Scales was in Faulty Towers. You'll love them in this comedy.",Positive
"one of my favorite shows and certainly one of my favorite episodes.  will certainly watch it again and again.  you will too,",Positive
I liked this show.  It was fast paced had numerous story lines starting and it was easy to relate to the characters.  Was kind of shocked at how some of the actors were killed off so soon!,Positive
this is absolutely the best &#34;cop&#34; series i have ever watched even if it is an oder series.  thanks for offering it!,Positive
"This particular show, now cancelled, started slowly and could have benefited from tighter writing and certain story line adjustments along the way. However, as it progressed one couldn't help but get hooked by all the twists and turns.  DECEPTION was a perfect title for this series and was applied in the broadest sense of the term.  Indeed, there were MANY deceptions leading up to a number of cliff hangers.  At that point, NBC dropped the axe leaving its viewership hanging.  Was Victor Garber the murderer of his own daughter? Did the drug to heal cancer really work? Who put out false information about it? What will happen to one of the lead characters after she discovered that her sister was really her mother? Is Victor Garber's younger son truly innocent?  Is his relationship with a former maid's daughter real?  Will the maid's daughter's current occupation - detective - be uncovered?  What role does the former maid play and what does she really know regarding &#34;household activity&#34;?  What is the situation with VG's second wife?  What will happen to VG's granddaughter who was just kidnapped by his second wife's boyfriend?  Get the picture?CBS did the same thing with &#34;GOLDEN BOY&#34;.  ABC did it with &#34;666&#34;.  When will the networks' &#34;powers that be&#34; give shows a break and realize that not everything can be first in its time slot?!  And it takes time for particular shows to catch on, especially when they are not your usual run of the mill.  It's also time to stop pandering to the 18-49 group.  The rest of us also spend plenty of money.  Or are advertisers as thick as the Network CEOs?  Why should one invest time watching any network show when it is liable to be cancelled all too soon by an impatient programmer?",Positive
"A simple concept... a tiny budget. Great stuff! A cast of three... and probably as many locations. Wow. Nicely done... taut, tense... genuinely interesting story with surprises, twists etc to boot. All unexpected.Surprised and delighted to have seen this. :)The writer/director J Blakeson did a terrific job IMHO, as did the actors... Gemma Arterton (Alice) apeared genuinely frightened, young Martin Compston (Danny) and Eddie Marsan (Vic) were genuinely cold and menacing.",Positive
This was pretty over the top with the amount of drug use and the premise has been done before in both football and baseball (see Major League).  Limited potential for future development.,Negative

"The Bay is a message hidden within a film, similar to 2008's the Happening, The Bay tells of the consequences of destroying our environment. In this film, dumping into the Chesapeake Bay has caused a harmless fish parasite to evolve into a human killer. What makes this film unique is the way in which it was shot. The film is shot as a documentary that was posted on a fictional Wikileaks type site, and tells the story of the outbreak in a small Maryland town, on July 4th. The cinematography is made up of everything you'd see at a small town festival, camcorders, cell phone cameras, news footage, police dash-cams, and security cameras. Through a collection of footage from the day, we are told the story of the outbreak by one of the only survivors, who had to let the world know of this tragedy that was covered up by the U.S. government. The different angles and the fact that their really weren't any main characters also make this film unique. The story really isn't much, as it just like a million other horror films. Everything is normal, until people start getting sick, and chaos ensues. It's not the story or even the actors that keep you interested in this film, it's the different pieces put together in documentary form by the narrator, Kether Donohue. Without the narration, it's just a collection of web clips, but there is some interest in finding out what happened to each of the people we see and in seeing them figure out what's going on at the same time that we do. It's not a great story and there aren't any stand out performances, but the film itself is done in such a unique way, that it will be like nothing you've ever seen before. Yes, The Bay is another way of telling us about the dangers of not caring for our environment, in a story that is severely lacking imagination, but it's worth seeing, simply from a stylistic point of view.",Negative
"As most fans of British t.v. dramas know, we don't even make series such as this in the U.S.  This is for adults, with great character development and unfolding plots, not boxed into a 1/2 hour.  And no vampires.",Positive
"The series has undergone many changes over time.  I liked Father Vincent.  He brought a more down to earth approach to his ministry.  The ending leaves you with the feeling that all would be well, if it had been a real story about a small community.  Overall the series was very entertaining.",Positive
"I've been reading Norse and Greek mythology since I could pick up a book, and even when I could understand the differences between the two, I knew that for the most part, Thor and Loki got along. Unlike the Greek gods, the Norse gods could die, but they never grew old -- and even Odin retained his savage strength until his death at the battle of Ragnorak. So to see Loki old and missing teeth is repulsive; and being so stereotypically evil is a sign of poor writing. Pass on this. True, Loki's actions in regard to Balder's passing did lead to Ragnorak and to his own death, as well as Thor's, Odin's and the other gods, but he wasn't the cackling super villain  depicted in these ridiculous cartoons. Buy the movies instead. They're more entertaining.",Negative
"If you have never heard of this film, chances are you will very soon.  Why, you may ask?  Well, aside from the fact that it&#8217;s an excellent, laugh-out-loud horror-comedy, it is also somewhat, um, unique in its subject matter.  I mean, how many movies about demons living in a guy&#8217;s bowels can there be?  BAD MILO! is a bizarre but amazing film that will have even the heartiest of gore-hounds laughing as they cringe.  Push your reservations away, and check out this film as soon as you can.You might expect a movie with this type of plot to be full of bad one-liners and poop jokes.  Surprisingly, it&#8217;s not.  The production team handles this concept very delicately and instead finds humor everywhere else.  I am very impressed with how they did this, and the end result has to be seen to believed.BAD MILO! is shot very well and features some inventive camerawork to capture the &#8220;ins and outs&#8221; of Milo&#8217;s experience.  His host, Duncan, obviously endures a bit of uncomfortableness, but that&#8217;s to be expected given Milo&#8217;s living arrangements.  The film is even shot on a RED camera, which makes the vivid picture even more extraordinary.The special effects are excellent.  The production crew uses practical effects for Milo, which makes this a more than noteworthy creature-feature.  Too many flicks today rely on CG, which lessens the believability factor of a monster.  Not so, here; thanks to realistic effects, Milo is slick and creepy&#8230;but with a hint of a sick cuteness factor as well.The acting in BAD MILO! is also very good, but the story itself is what really wins the prize for me.  Inventive and original, this is one of those films that only comes along once in a great while.  While the subject matter may make some folks cringe, it&#8217;s not nearly as grotesque as it sounds on paper.  You just simply have to see it to appreciate it.BAD MILO! is a huge win for me, and I recommend snatching this one up ASAP.  Be sure and get it on Blu-ray if you can; the enhanced picture and sound quality are worth it.  There are also a nice batch of Special Features to go along with the film, including an extended outtake reel (they show a few outtakes during the credits), a deleted scene, and a couple of behind the scenes featurettes.  Regardless of what format you choose, give this one a look for sure.  It is available now.",Positive
This show was hilarious and I'm sure I would have loved the whole thing if I didn't have to turn it off due to the massive amount of swear words. This show would reach to a much larger audience if the language was cleaned up. Does throwing in the f word every other sentence make something that much funnier or does it lose its shock value. Unfortunately I couldn't finish this.,Negative

"If you liked vampire diaries you will love this. Same people in vampire diaries, but different. It is exciting to watch. New vampires and hybrid.",Positive
"This season really takes you there as far as a fan's commitment to SOA.  All the characters are getting a peel.  Jax, Clay and especially Gemma have morphed into some creatures that at some point in this season are unrecognizable.  Chibs, Happy have always been down for whatever ride that has a spare seat.  Bobby and Juice, however, are seeing things through a completely different lense, it's about time.  This season gives you a lot of education on what is becoming of each character.  How life in the club isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  And I believe us fans knew that from the start.  It's just the characters are picking up on it.  And it's a wonderful experience watching it all unfold.",Positive
"Background... Republicans housed up in a &#34;condo&#34; somewhere in Washington.Characters are somewhat interesting, plot... well, no real progression through the series plot, more like a weekly sitcom with a bit of carry over from one episode to the other.Trudeau (Doonesbury fame), is the major driving force behind a lot of this, and honestly, I never clicked all that well with Doonesbury.So, thinking it's an acquired taste, I have been watching the series.Started out as less than okay, slow, stilted conversations, not a lot of bantering interaction with speed (something that I like, see Sherlock)....But it's been growing on me, last episode or two it's been picking up and they've even thrown in some &#34;sight gags&#34; that to my mind worked.So, started a 2, about a 3 now, but showing signs of getting better.Personally, if I hadn't invested time in it already (and somewhat desperate as a cable cutter), I'd wait it out the first season, pick it up on the second (where I'm hoping it will gain more momentum), and back track to the first season, just to backfill my knowledge of the characters.Pilot by the way, had Bill Murray in it for all of about 5 minutes, but was the highlight of that episode.",Negative
"Weird but I rather liked it. The acting was good the story unique. Worth watching especially on PRIME, free instant, Don't know how I would feel if I had to pay for it!",Positive
"I like this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" better than any other. It's true to the book, the cast is excellent and the locations are wonderful too. Colin Firth will always be Mr. Darcy for me.",Positive
"I've enjoyed this season. I do miss the Mitchell and Glenn segments. But that said, I still enjoy the very different experience of watching this show. It is a welcome diversion from the fictional shows that I usually watch.",Positive
"After a slow and not funny start, the series gains momentum and becomes one of the best curreNt comedies. Indeed, after changing a roommate after the initial episode, the series had an uneasy start with its humor feeling forced. What was obvious is that they were not able to capitalize frm the start on what would become the strength of the series: the irritating cute charm of the star theyy had in deschanel. Indeed the first episodes ( and I mean all of the first DVD) are unfunny and forced and make you want to cringe. However on the second DVD suddenly everything changes, basically the writing is much improved and this becomes one of the best series around overall.",Positive
Always so much going on! I never get bored watching this show and that's why I have rated it like I have.  Read my post on season 3.  Having a marathon over a weekend watching each and every episode is way fun for me.,Positive
"I don't understand other reviews, this is a 0 star movie, but I had to put 1.  The acting is bad, what happens in the story is bad (at leaast 1 stupid decision by every character in the movie that make you go ""oh, come on"").This might just be the worst movie I've ever seen.",Negative
"Longmire, The First Season, is a solid series. Well acted and written, fantastic camera workcombined with interesting character studies. Each episode has it's own uniqueness, while maintaininga consistent theme. Well done!",Positive
"Just barely a 4-star rating, even though it honestly deserves a 3.  Due to liking the first half so much I'll be generous.  The Motel Life is about two brothers who are drifters, but because of guidance from their mother when they were teenagers, they've decided that no matter what, through thick and thin, they'll remain together even during the worst of times.After the one brother accidentally kills a little boy riding his bicycle, he gets a little crazy in the head and eventually shoots himself in the leg after making us believe he killed himself due to the tricky timing and camera angles of the segment.  After destroying the evidence (catching his car on fire alongside the road one brisk morning... and why do they always wait until morning?) he's not quite out of the clear despite finding a way to cover up the windshield/car damage and blood marks.For much of the first half, it's all about covering his tracks with his brother coming up with clever ways to thwart the police so they don't catch on and realize he's guilty of murder.  The first half is actually awesome for the most part even the memorable gambling/boxing match which did a great job of fooling me pertaining to the outcome.  In fact the brother who hit the bicyclist is responsible for some surprising moments of storytelling since I could have sworn I knew his fate based on his nervous ""ready to crack at any moment"" character but I was wrong.The only parts that seem unusual and out of place are the occasional animated storytelling segments you will see throughout the Motel Life.  It seems like more movies are throwing in oddball animation in between storyline segments to tell the story from another (deeper) perspective, but in this case these particular segments don't really add up to anything substantial.  They barely feel related to the storyline.My only issue with this film is that the second half *really* loses steam and often gets boring as it focuses on drama.  Get ready for more drama/talking segments to occur after a certain hospital escape scene.  Otherwise the two brothers are believable and interesting in their characters, Dakota Fanning never adds up to much since she could have been easily replaceable by any number of actresses out there, and treat the Motel Life for what it is- a simple story involving two drifter brothers.",Positive
"End-of-world scenarios are always fun to watch and think about afterwards&#8212;there are so many avenues to go down and so much raw potential! I'm also a huge X-Files (Chris Carter) fan, so I had high expectations going into this.After watching, I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of this pilot. Where it falls completely flat is with the acting and dialog. The characters are incredibly cliche&#8230;nearly every line made me want to facepalm. Also, there was a bit too much emphasis on her phone in this episode&#8212;honestly, what's up with that???The creatures at the end looked pretty cool, and I would definitely watch the second episode just to find out what's going on here (hence my 3/5 rating). But overall, I would've liked to have been able to buy into the storyline more. It's really difficult to immerse yourself in a good story when all the characters are just so annoyingly fake.",Negative
"This is the most coolest series. It never lacks for adventure. It has suspense, drama, scary stuff that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It has some funny ones sometimes like when Dr. Mckay had another persons consciousness inside his brain that was hilarious among others. you can't  beat this series it's one of the best. you won't be disappointed. try it you'll see.",Positive
"I can't wait for it to be Friday and watch this show. It's funny and entertaining and a joy to watch. Characters are extremely well defined. I'm an engineer in the east coast, not from this country, and I use the close caption when I don't get a lot of the things and words they say; I've learned a lot about how some techies talk. Utterly funny and I my non techy family watches it because I told them how refreshing this is.",Positive
"I love this show but feel there is too much repetition in the filming, which has nothing to do with the Kilchers. This could be a wonderful show if the people who filmed it did a better job.",Positive
"My real pleasure in this sitcom is watching the interplay between the chief geeks: Leonard, who wants to be normal, and Sheldon, who disdains normality.  Perhaps that's why this show has such a following: many brainy types find themselves torn between wanting to fit into the human race, and having little interest in being ordinary.  I teach at the university level, so I see this basic pattern play out among my colleagues every working day.Leonard has fallen for Penny, the pretty aspiring actress living across the hall.  Sheldon has a very narrow range of interests, in which he continually tries to improve himself, but little concern for anything outside his comfort zone.  Leonard would love to shut off the ideas constantly whizzing around his brain.  Sheldon would love to shut off the world and retreat into those ideas for the rest of his life.  Neither one can have what he wants.These brainiacs attract a huge audience, I contend, because real-life brainy types have both these paradigms at play simultaneously.  I'd love, like Sheldon, to care nothing for sex or approval, and just do what fulfills me.  But I'd also love, like Leonard, to reach outside myself and join the human race as an equal.  Sadly, I can do neither.  So I, and studious geeks worldwide, will sit back and watch these nerds fight that battle for me.",Positive
This is not a show for everyone. If you like fairy tales with twist this would be a show for you. For me it captures my thoughts and makes me think.,Positive
"Pretty good movie. The acting is over-the-top like it's suposed to be. The violence is extreme, as it should be. It reminded me of the Troma films. I really enjoyed Rutger as the hobo. He is probably the most restrained of all the characters and that seems like the right way to play it. I'm glad I watched it, but I don't want to own it.  For me, more nudity would have made the movie a beter example of the genre. The scene with the topless women hitting a guy with baseball bats and then Drake taking a swing was great. If the violence, story, lighting, etc are nonsensical then showing skin should be too.",Negative
"The two remaining innkeepers at the Yankee Pedlar Inn get more than they bargained for when they set out to capture evidence of the hotel's legendary ghost in THE INNKEEPERS, Ti West's highly-anticipated followup to HOUSE OF THE DEVIL. Once again, the director moves to impress with his incredible talent for balancing a slow, deliberate pace with clever characters and spooky suspense, though the same can't be said for the plot, itself. Sara Paxton and Pat Healy couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the two awkward leads, bringing their own dry wit and innocent charm to the characters. For all West's skills as a writer and director, however, he is found lacking as an effective storyteller. He simply doesn't know where to go with his films, and as a result, they typically fall apart in the final act. THE INNKEEPERS is no exception. While we have fun sitting back and laughing with his two bumbling hotel clerks, the questions set up in the first several chapters are left entirely open-ended, and the mild shocks do not compensate for the lengthy build and anticipation. Still, it is impossible to deny the man's skill behind a camera. Even the most trivial scenes are made interesting through his keen visual style, which keeps the audience glued to the screen despite the overall lack of action. Fans of the slow burn will appreciate the many redeeming qualities in THE INNKEEPERS, and it is sure to receive a cult status amongst other subtle haunts like THE CHANGELING, THE SENTINEL, or BURNT OFFERINGS.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",Negative
"I have been a huge fan of Zoey Deschanel ever since she was in A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. She also made appearances in several of my other favorite films including The Bridge to Tarabithia and Tin Man.  Zoey has a unique beauty and a witty personality that makes her shine in any role she undertakes and New Girl is no different.  In this funny series a young girl moves in with three bachelors. That would lead to comic episodes no matter what, but  Jessie and her quirky habits and New Age ideas don't always fly with the All-American men she resides with and more than once, personalities clash.  The story line was pretty predictable in most cases, but told with humor and personality that made it seem more interesting. Jake M. Johnson, Max Greenfield, and Lamorne Morris also add a healthy dose of eye candy. I love the show and I'm hoping it lasts a few more seasons, but I think the writers will have to pull some more original content in the coming season for this to work out.",Positive
"One of the best police dramas on any medium.  I love the characters, The Interplay, even the Villains are Great. I wish the episodes were longer.",Positive

"The show was hilarious, I do wish it focused on the Onion empire (infomercials, talk shows, reality shows, etc) but the news only angle was still solidly done. Much like the Onion news stories there were times when it was so close to fact about the source material (in this case over-dramatized news dramas) that the two were almost indistinguishable. Well done. If you enjoyed the show I would suggest taking a look at some of the 1-star comments; the morons, adolescents and christian fundamentalists are funny enough, but the 1-star reviews that satire the aforementioned groups take the cake. One person was deeply offended at the mention of Jesus' bulge while another wrote the show off because nano-millimeter is not a real measurement. Moral of this story; watch the show, rate it five stars, then read the 1-star comments and revel in the feeling of intellectual  superiority.",Positive
I just love these British mysteries.  The plot is very interesting and many times I am surprises with who done it!  The main characters are human and interesting.,Positive
I loved this series and so did my wife. I love purchasing and watching using my Roku. Amazon allows me to keep my movies and music in the cloud at no cost. Easy access from any mobile device.,Positive
"Swamp People was an ok show. I chose to watch this show after seeing it pop up as a recommendation here on Amazon. I love the show Mountain Men and I love the show Duck Dynasty and Swamp people seems to try to capture some of the same feelings from these shows. You have the &#34;redneck&#34; feel from Duck Dynasty and the &#34;tough guy&#34; feeling from Mountain Men. While it was definitely interesting to get a peek into the unique lives of the people on this show, I didnt feel like any of the characters really had that appeal or charm that a reality show needs to keep viewers interested. Plus, there are really only so many times one can watch people catch crocodiles in a swamp. &#34;Meh&#34; is my overall opinion of this show. I wouldn't recommend it or choose it again.",Negative
"JT is one the strongest players to play Survivor. Stephen is one of the smartest to ever play the game. These 2 paired up makes up one of the greatest duos in survivor history. Coach is an obnoxious player who thinks he knows everything and is a big joke. This is his first appearance out of his 3 times playing and is one of a kind. Eddie George's wife Taj is in this game and probably would be voted out early but she finds something that helps her stay in the game. Tocantins is probably the worst location Survivor could ever choose. The island setting is more fitting for survivor and Africa is a good switch up because of the wildlife. There really isn't anything good about the Brazilian highlands. Exile island is a big sand dune and 2 people from opposite tribes get an opportunity to form an alliance. I didn't like Tyson at first, but he grew on me and I realized he's great at challenges and he can have a really tight knit alliance. Give Tyson a chance and he will win you over. There is a surprise vote in the beginning and turns out that it really is a good or bad thing depending on the decisions the players make after they get voted for.",Positive
"I almost didn't watch this show, it didn't really appeal to me.  Boy am I ever glad I did!  I loved it!  It kept my attention from start to finish!  The characters are great and very well acted.  I say if you only keep 2 shows, then it has to be Bosch and Mozart in the Jungle!  Bravo!",Positive

"This is the third season of Adventure Time I've reviewed. It's also the first time I've been moved to review so many seasons of a single show. As I said in my review of season two, ""Watching an episode of Adventure Time unfold is like poetry."" As I also said in that same review ""The thing I love most about this show (covering all seasons in fact) is its unique combination of extreme simplicity, gentle playfulness, and profound depth.""Well, all that still holds true.  But do I have anything fresh to say? Anything more to add that justifies writing this third review?As an audience, we're no longer automatically blown away by the sheer range and depth the creators of this series are so obviously capable of. We've just come to expect it. So we're not going to be stunned by this offering in quite the same way that we might have been by earlier seasons. But we are in no way left wanting: the quality has not dropped one jot. And although on one level this series is more of the same, the show most definitely continues to develop. It's never reduced to mere repetition or self referencing.In keeping with the underlying trend of past seasons, the complexity of the characters continues to evolve. Perhaps the most marked and obvious examples of this are in two of my all time favorite episodes, ""Holly Jolly Secrets, parts 1 and 2"". But I'm not going to say any more than that. If you've seen those episodes, you know exactly what I'm talking about. And if you haven't,  I don't want to deprive you of the experience of going on that journey for yourself.This trend towards ever increasing character complexity is also apparent in such coming-of-age episodes as ""Too Young"" and ""Incendium"", although never in an obvious or heavy handed way. As always in this series, there's a wonderful lightness of touch. The deeper layers of meaning are readily apparent, but we're not hit over the head with them in the way we might be in more standard Hollywood fare. They're just there for those who feel ready and inclined to think about them. Indeed, perhaps this show's greatest virtue is that its creators know when to leave things unsaid.Yes, they actually have enough respect for the intelligence of their audience to do that.Incredible, huh?Which also brings me to the single episode that perhaps best embodies my earlier statement that watching an episode of Adventure Time unfold is like poetry: ""Thank You"". For those who know the episodes but not by name, this is the one that focuses on the Snow Golem. It's also episode number 17 in this season.Finally, it's worth adding that this is the season that sees the first appearance of ""Fiona and Cake"", the gender swapped version of Adventure Time! Honestly, I think this season is worth buying just for that alone. I especially love the way the existence of stories about these alternative versions of the characters is justified within the show's own universe. Which could get me back to ""Holly Jolly Secrets"", but... No.Like I said before: some things I want you to experience for yourself.Theo.",Positive
"Yeah, I thought so too, but I decided to check this out of the library anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's clever, well written, with appealing main characters you care about, even though they're a nerdy werewolf, a ghost, and a vampire (who's trying to quit ""live"" blood, really, he is honestly...oops, there he goes again.  ""Hi, my name is Aidan, and I've been off live blood for 0 days.  Rats."")  I haven't seen the UK version yet, so I don't know how it compares.Has blood, violence, people in their underwear, and a naked guy with his hands strategically placed, so, not for little kids.",Positive

"`The Burning Plain' tells the dark and dangerous story of a young woman named Sylvia, who is battling memories of a tragic incident that took place while she was a teen.  This story, told in four parts, is rich with character development and pure insight on the process of pain, and forgiveness.  While those stories can at times become a tad confusing (bouncing from teen love, an adulterous affair, a clinically depressed woman and then a father/daughter accident storyline can get a little too garbled for its own good) they truly work out a beautifully told story in the end, one that highlights the tragic aftermath of poor decisions and the cooling power of atonement.  The film is also packed with marvelous performances.  Charlize Theron, Kim Basinger and Jennifer Lawrence are all spectacular.  Theron attacks her character's growing pain with sharp rawness.  Basinger trembles with aching realism as she contemplates her actions and Lawrence, far more natural and organic here than in her Oscar nominated role in `Winter's Bone', is a marvelous portrait of teen misunderstanding.  The story is heartbreaking and yet, that final frame encapsulates all the hope needed to give a more tender and realistic `happy-ending'.  And that score is just superb!",Positive

"Having read, watched, researched samurai, this is one of the few that really express the intensity and life of honor that the true samurai lived for. Their education included so much more. They looked for and cultivated art and beauty, within and without. And honor, that was an art. This was an epic film, and although there were some minor plot holes, such as how a small village and 13 men were able to create a trap of such magnitude in such a short time, still it echoed the true spirit of the samurai, and for that it gets 5 stars. There was no glossing over the brutal life and death situations they found themselves in, chasing and being chased with 3-foot razor blades. There was also none of the fly-by-wire fights or over-the-top blood sprays.  Samurai didn't believe that life had no meaning, they believed that one had to GIVE it meaning, and boy did this film show that in spades. Yes, it was somewhat dark, but in several scenes one can see the care and grace with which they lived. Also, at this time, samurai were pretty much 'titled', and most did not have the training or the desire to pursue the ascetic life that often was required. That is shown here as well. Those who enjoy stories that have historical significance and deeper meaning will really enjoy this film.",Positive

I liked it but found it hard to pull for the Russians.  There were several unexpected twists which make the future more exciting.,Positive
I love this show. The stars are great together. Love Alex O'loughlin as Steve McGarrett & Scott Caan as Danny Williams that partnership makes the show.  Like Daniel dae kim & Grace Park too. The shots of Hawaii are also the stars of the show. EXCELLENT show.,Positive
"I would rate &#34;Justified&#34; with 4 1/2 stars if I could, but it is very close to perfection for me.  Interesting, quirky characters, action, suspense, and plenty of humor (although usually very dark).  I have to give most of the credit to the writers, but the acting by the entire cast is top notch.  Timothy Olyphant (Raylan) and Walton Goggins (Boyd) are incredible to watch, especially in the scenes they share together.  Jere Burns, as Wynn Duffy, turns in another great rendition of his signature creepy psychopath.  It's the eyes: even when he's not supposed to be creepy, he just is. Margo Martindale is exceptional (as always) in her role of Mags Bennett.  I've never seen a female villain quite like her.  She somehow manages to be sympathetic, which is very difficult to do.I would highly recommend &#34;Justified&#34; to anyone who enjoys character-driven drama or action-suspense mixed with the right amount of unconventional humor.  Just be prepared to be hooked; one episode quickly turns into three or four in one sitting!",Positive

"As the camera slowly moves in on Danny brushing his teeth, there, on the left side of the wall is a sticker of Dopey from Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Later, after Danny is revealed by Toby some of the incidents that will occur at the Overlook Hotel, it would appear that the sticker is no longer there. The ""theorist"", by way of narration, explains that Danny is ""no longer a dope"". Yup, this theory and more abound in ROOM 237, a supposedly insightful, highly subjective, examination of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.I was not really sure what to expect. Will I hear about symbolism? Hidden gestures by Kubrick to reveal the larger truth of the film? An explanation of the film itself and what some of the more mysterious moments meant? You will not be treated to any of these things that one might assume at face value. In fact, nothing that is ""revealed"" has anything to do with the movie. Apparently all of the theories relate to some outside dilemma that Kubrick (presumably) was grappling with and felt the need to embed these ideas in this film. Why that is the case no one answered.If anyone has seen the documentary Kubrick's Odyssey, they will well learn that Kubrick faked the moon landing for Nasa using the same effects as in 2001, and that, for keeping this a secret, he revealed clues laid out throughout the movie in this film. In ROOM 237, the same author retells much of that theory in this film so it might be redundant.Other theories regard its a film about the Holocaust, the genocide of the American Indians, or the mythological Minotaur. Or you just need to watch the film forward and backward simultaneously. All of these theories might be interesting on their own with no regard to content or context. Together they are just a mash of ideas with no thread in place. One even wonders if The Shining is a basis for their conclusions or if its just their own fanatical ideas being projected onto a very psychological playing field.It becomes clear that these 5 people who admire Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, know how to inspect the film and its intricate details, but do not seem to know how to watch a film. Or at least interpret properly the language of cinema. What they explain gives the view no insights into the film itself, nor of Stanley Kubrick. Beginning with the obvious, that Jack Nicholson's character slowly goes mad from isolation might be a good place to start to draw the viewer in their thinking. Instead we are slapped with obscure objects in the background that is faintly paid attention to by most casual viewers.Because of this, I cant help but feel that all these interpretations are complete non-sense and have no place in a serious discussion of the film. The film is almost a joke and I wonder if the director is exploiting these people who seriously believe in their theories? It would be sad that Kubrick's film was used to make such a joke by the director. If he believes anything these theorists propose, then the director needs to revisit a book on symbology. I can't recommend this film, but I suspect ardent Kubrick fans will want to see it and understandably so. If that is the case, then it is not a terrible viewing.

"Where is the creativity, the genius, the work ethic of characters who say they are proud because an alcohol induced courage allows one to go on stage and perform with no talent?  This &#34;comedy&#34; may mirror what some think is the nature of their lives, but it is in very sad in that it seems to limit all that there is and does not allow any characters to rise above the pedestrian life they live.  This is a soap opera about limitation the victims a technically advanced society creates and gives them an excuse for their limitations because of the society that has created them.  Perhaps there is a degree of truth in this series, but it does not rise to the level of comedy in a contemporary sense.",Negative

"The Fringe team, after investigating numerous paranormal crimes, discovering and traveling to an alternate universe and saving the world many times is now traveling in time to a future where the Observers have taken over the world for a purpose as yet unknown. The Fringe team has been seperated for over two decades frozen in amber and unaware of what is happening in the world. Olivia and Peter's daughter was raised as an orphan in this totalitarian new world where humans are little better than slaves. The overall arc is how to beat the Observers and put the timeline back to its original shape.In this episode, Walter, as usual, has the beginnings of a solution but has hidden it in beta tapes that are scattered around the country, a country where humans are no longer free to travel, but the team sets out anyway and discovers a group of people, who are recording humanity's true history in the face of extinction. Clues are found, sacrifices are made and the season long arc is added to. A solid episode of Fringe and an interesting reinvention for one of television's most surreal sci-fi shows. Recommended. Newbies of course should go back and watch the entire series, available here on Amazon Prime.",Positive
we have been watching the show since season 1..good acting - good storyline..one of the best crime shows currently out there...,Positive
This series is just addictive. I saw the commercials for the second season not knowing that it was the second season. Someone told me so I went to Amazon to see if it had the first season and it did. We marathoned the first season last weekend for free with Amazon Prime and then purchased the first episode of the second season to get caught up.Thank you Amazon Prime for getting us caught up with Vikings.,Positive

"When unmanned probes suggest that a hidden ocean could exist underneath Europa's icy surface and may contain single-celled life, Europa Ventures, a privately funded space exploration company, sends six of the best astronauts from around the world to confirm the data and explore the discovery. After a nearly catastrophic technical failure that leads to loss of communication with Earth and the tragic death of a crew member, the surviving astronauts must overcome the psychological & physical toll of deep space travel, and survive a discovery on Europa more profound than they had ever imagined.I hate to admit it but what originally sold me on this film was the trailer. What excited me about the film was the fact that Europa Report was conceived on a real-life event in which scientists, back in November 2011, discovered water beneath the ice of Jupiter's moon Europa. While the film does a good job of creating and maintaining tension throughout it and the story keeps you interested, the payoff at the end just doesn't warrant sitting through its' ninety-minute length. It reminded me alot of Apollo 18 in that respect. That film was fantastic all the way up to the end...then you find out that what was attacking them was&lt;spoiler alert> actually killer alien rocks? &lt;smh> It was anticlimatic, to say the least.At any rate, for what its' worth, Europa Report isn't too bad a watch. It does set things up nicely if they decide to make a second film. All I can say is--don't expect an outstanding ending because there isn't one.",Negative

"I like Titus Welliver.  But, this show seems like a bad adaptation from a mediocre crime novel.  It does not adequately transform whatever the original material was into an interesting television show.  It seems like an ABC show that would be cancelled mid-season.It's a throwback to 80's noir TV dramas, but lacking in depth or interest, with cliched, hackey dialogue, and some incredibly lackluster supporting actors.I was utterly uninterested after several plot developments and didn't care at all about any of the characters.",Negative
I'm a Stargate fan since the original movie came out.  The original TV series SG-1 was a good one that lasted many seasons.  I checked this one out after watching the SG-1 series to the end.  This one has a different spin but a similar show (same creators).  I've enjoyed this one as well.,Positive

"As a sci-fi fan I had to check this one out and usually I review after the first season is over, however I think in this case after episode 12 we have enough material to do a thorough review.Cast: 5/5  Nothing to really say here, they are all good-looking, young, sexy actors who don't suck.Character Development: This is one of the main areas that the show fails for me. There is significant development in the characters, however, don't feel like the characters MATURE much.  In fact, I would say that several of them (you will know who I am talking about) who started out as mature, stable, and kind characters, devolve rather quickly into petty, arrogant, power-hungry brats. Relationships are fluid, unstable, confusing, and shallow. Usually there are at least one or two characters that jump out at me and make me say ""that one is my favorite"", but this one the characters are all so ""lukewarm"" that I don't find that my interest stays glued to any particular one.Plot: This is also where I took off one star. The show keeps repeating ""We are at war"" every episode. Just to try to convince the viewers that there is supposed to be a serious plot going on, even though it's lost somewhere in translation and I just can't take the show that seriously. Every episode the ""Tomorrow People"" sit around chatting merrily and playing pool, having fun, while the leaders and the ""double agent"" are risking their lives to ...  I forgot. Yeah it's just that memorable. Even the scenes where they go ""grocery shopping"" to try to explain how they sustain their subterranean lives don't have any sense of urgency to it. Many parts of the plot are disjointed, and the ""inability to kill"" as a genetic trait is laughable. It invalidates the whole point of being at ""war"" and the plot holes such a device creates are big enough to drive a train through.Relationships: Didn't take off a star for this because as  confusing and muddled the relationships in this show are, it seems to be standard among almost all of the modern series, and so I will leave my commentary at that.Special effects/CGI: Average. First time I have seen telekinesis represented as blue lightning-bolt kind of blobs. Darth Vader was much more convincing and he didn't need visual aids to be scary, and the last time I checked telekinesis was not a visible power.Overall Rating: 3/5Don't expect any depth. This is an interesting show to watch but if you are hoping for something that will leave you glued to your chair biting your fingernails waiting for the next episode, this one isn't probably for you. If you want to see something averagely entertaining with an average plot with confusing contradictions and muddled relationships then this might interest you. There are many times in the show where you will do a facepalm and ask yourself ""if they could have done that in the first place, they would have!"", and this show would have been reduced to 1 episode.",Negative

I (myself) haven't been privy to kiddy programs in quite a while.  (Daughter's in college) So when I was babysitting my sister's grand daughter I was at a loss as to what to choose for &#34;quiet time&#34; watching.  So I got out my Kindle Fire and SHE got to choose for herself!  What a hit!  Not only did she feel a little independant that it was HER choice but I was impressed (& comfortable) with her choice.

"The Fox series Prison Break debuted in 2005 and had a first season that was intelligently written, intelligently executed, and endlessly exciting. The series miraculously had two more seasons (with season three being cut short due to the writer's strike) and Fox announced the fourth season would be the final season. I absolutely love this show, but the idea to end it was a good one. Prison Break was a one-season concept that made two seasons work but just got more and more ludicrous as it went on, while never failing to be entertaining. With that said, the fourth season is very entertaining. It's this season that the writer's throw all logic out the window. Character's who were dead return, character's who were forgotten come out of nowhere; the writer's of this season seem to have had one rule for writing; if it can go wrong (no matter how implausible), make sure it does.We've followed these character's as they escaped from prison (season one), ran from the law (season 2), and had to escape from another prison (season 3). In season 4, they have to break in to a building. Sounds interesting, right?Everyone has escaped from Sona, the prison in Panama that housed the characters for the third season. Now in Los Angeles, Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller), his brother Lincoln Burroughs (Dominic Purcell), girlfriend Sarah Tancredi (Sarah Wayne Callies), Sucre (Amaury Nolasco), Brad Bellick (Wade Williams), and former FBI-agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) are recruited by Homeland Security agent Don Self (Michael Rappaport) for a top-secret operation to help take down The Company for good. With an offer of immunity for everyone on the table, the group agrees to help Self retrieve Scylla, the Company's little black book.All of the characters are back, including everybody's favorite villain T-Bag (Robert Knepper), who (as usual) has a different agenda than the rest of the group. Also, in a much larger role, is Leon Russom as General Jonathan Krantz, but more on that in a moment.Season four will have you shaking your head several times throughout simply because of how completely ridiculous many of the plot twists are, but it ranks high on the excitement scale. As for how it ends...Well, those who have followed this show and these characters for years will be divided, but how else could they have ended it? The ending works, but could have been executed a little better.Now, on another note...I'm not the first person to complain about the weak, anything goes-style of writing on Prison Break, but I wish to mention that the writer's never failed to write strong main characters. It's hard to deny this is a show with strong characterization that has a knack for establishing characters for us to care about and establishing characters for us to hate only to trick us into liking them later. But, I will not let the actors escape without credit.Prison Break, during its run, was never honored for the actor's it had on its show. One doesn't have to even watch this show very long to see that this was a shame. Wentworth Miller, for example, is the only person I can see as Scofield. He's quietly menacing, committed, and charismatic...Not to say he doesn't overdo it sometimes, but he balances the tough and emotional in a way most actors would not. If one denies the range of Wade Williams as Bellick, watch all four seasons of this show and tell me how Bellick goes from one of the most unlikeable characters on the show to a very sympathetic one in such a short span of time. Even Purcell, who never had to do much in the series besides look tough and be intimidating when needed, embodies Burroughs. That description of his acting is pretty much all the character needs to do, so it all fits. Finally, we have Robert Knepper whose performance as T-Bag only got better with each season. If this had been a theatrical film as opposed to a TV series, Knepper would have received an Oscar nomination. If not for fan-reaction to Knepper's portrayal of the devious, depraved T-Bag he likely would've been killed off at the end of season one. Knepper takes a relatively simple character and just molds him into one of the most memorable characters I've ever seen on a television series. It's no easy task to take a character that frequently betrays and hurts the character's you care about and make him likeable and every moment Knepper is onscreen, he'll keep your attention focused there. Finally, Russom as the General has a very menacing look coupled with a deep, foreboding voice...He makes a great antagonist for Scofield's gang. All of the other actor's are great too, but this has already taken up a large majority of my review.There's not much to write about the fourth season of a television show. If you're reading this, you've likely seen the previous three seasons or you've already seen all four. If you're a fan, this season is definitely worth checking out if only to see the last hurrah of these character's you've watched for so long. While Prison Break lost some IQ points along the way, it never lost its ability to keep your heart racing and keep your affection for its main set of characters. With that said, if you're a fan of the series...This is essential.GRADE: B",Positive
"Our hero, Nick, with the help of Monroe (a reformed wesen) & briefly Nick's mother, is growing into his family's line of reasponsibility as a Grimm.  Hank, his police partner, is freaking out because he doesn't know what to make of what he has seen.  Juliette, his lover and friend, was attacked by an angry, vengeful wesen and after being in a coma for three days, remembers everyone around her except Nick.  The captain is able to hide his wesen side, perhaps due to being a royal.  This is a wonderful show, at times side-spitting and at others terrifying.

"We needed a good Viking show. I like this due to the fact there isn't a lot of Spartacus porn, like the other series. Enough is enough with that crap. I can tell when I really like a show because I am bummed out when the episode is over and I have to Wait a week for the  next one. I highly recommend this series.",Positive
"The overall look (lighting, cinematography) of the show is great. The werewolve makeup relies too too much on sideburns and contact lenses.  The scripts, while slightly meandering, keep the intensity up to make you want more. Since the show is geared for the young MTV aduience, the cast is of course beautiful, but manage to hold their own. A very good sci-fi series which is a rarity.",Positive
"A thoughtful and highly original tv series. Great acting, first rate stories.  Accept the highly unusual premise and enjoy it.  Jason Isaacs is a unique and appealing star.  Since it's so good it will undoubtedly be cancelled, so watch it now while you can.",Positive
"I saw the reviews on here and read some internet posts about how great this show was, so I bought it. I'd seen a clip of the show on the internet and thought it was interesting, but the lead just gave me bad vibes. Watching the first three episodes last night, I just couldn't take it anymore! Callie, his love interest, is totally annoying. She is a nurse who also goes to medical school and has a son. Jim is a know-it-all punk who always magically has the upper hand. There is no explanation at all for why or how he outsmarts everyone, he just does. The characters is very smug and unlikeable. Maybe he appeals to narcissistic Generation X and Y types, but not me. Furthermore, Jim doesn't have any depth. He is in jerk mode all of the time. He's not even vulnerable. This is the worst written show on TV!The character is just not believable as a cop. He acts like a rich prep schooler. I believe that he is supposed to be middle-class, but the writers probably can't even comprehend how to create a middle-class character, so they based one off of their own privileged lives. It's almost like they couldn't stand writing Callie as just a nurse, so they made her a nurse who is trying to be a doctor! Now she's classy enough for the show!I got bored during episodes. The shows I watched began with a murder, then just became disjointed as time went on. Jim would investigate, meet up with Callie, make sarcastic comments, then there would be a final magical scene that resolves everything perfectly. The Carlos Gomez character is the only interesting one that comes across as human, but even he has no chemistry with the lead.I just couldn't stand the show anymore and I put it up for sale. I really don't recommend it.",Negative
We enjoy watch Annie as she progresses in her skill set as a spy the interaction she has with her sister in hiding that she is a spy to when she reads her sister in and how Annie handles rejection as well as how Annie and her sister make amends.

"Heroes season 2 I think was pretty good considering that they cut it down due to that uselesss writer's strike. I mean the strike was useless, not the writers themselves. It left us with nothing but crappy reality shows through-out most of the year. Heroes season 2 told as good of a story as it could've due to the short time. It does start out a bit better than it ends though. Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka) still steals the show. Him in the past where he meets his childhood hero Takezo Kensei (an excellent David Anders of Alias) led to some of the more engaging stuff of the season. Parkman (Greg Grunberg) finding out that his father is infact Molly's nightmareman was a little disappointing I admit. However the nightmare scenes were done well enough that I didn't care after awhile. I just wish that their was more of him since he was one of the fresher things about this season. He also was a little creepy.Speaking of creepy, Sylar (Zachary Quinto) is back but powerless. He shows that he's dangerous even without his powers though. He meets a woman with a dangerous power that kills everyone around her when her eyes turn black and bleed. She's a good person but her powers kill people and only her brother's power can control her power if that makes sense. Sylar gets in her head and makes her think that he's a good person that wants to help her. When he's really just fascinated by her power and wants it for himself. Well when he gets his back that is and he thinks Mohinder (Sendhil Ramamurthy) can help him get them back.While Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) mysteriously lost his memory and doesn't remember his brother Nathan or even having powers. He falls for a women who's brother says he can help him remmember. He wants him to use his powers for bad though before he'll help him. While Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman) moves his daughter Claire (Hayden Panettiere) somewhere to protect her from the company. He tells her to stay low. That's easier said than done when a kid there sees that she has powers. It's ok with him though since he can...fly.I was entertained by the season. It has many twists and turns. Does it all lead up to something great though in the end ? No, I can't really say that. Instead of NY being threatened by a bomb it's now threatened by a virus. While instead of Hiro seeing the future and seeing that NY is doomed, Peter does instead. So they could've been more original, it was too familiar to what we already seen in season 1. While Ali Larter has shown she can act as Nikki, she's wasted in this season with little to do.It also bugged me that some new heroes have powers that we have already seen. Such as, one can fly ""like Nathan"", while another can heal ""like Claire"". However those were probably my only problems with the season. Other than that they did what they could due to the strike and it could have been worse.",Positive

"Ok, so I am not big on Aliens or Nuns but this show is the greatest.  From the crazed patients to the even more crazed staff, the story line is weird but keeps you hooked.  Better then Season 1.  Can't wait for Season 3.",Positive
This tv show is just very boring and weird. Also the animation is absolutely repulsive and sore on the eyes. Its the kind of show that makes me wonder if the people at cartoon network are crackheads.,Negative
"First of all, this is an Eli Roth film. If you don't know who he is, he's the man responsible forCabin Feverand the line ofHostelfilms, all of which are grim, violent movies. (Leader of the ""Splat Pack,"" some journalists have dubbed him.) CABIN FEVER I actually enjoyed, but only because it had a sense of humor about what it was doing, and you get the impression from some of Roth's other work (specifically some of his cameo appearances as well as his work with Tarantino) that he doesn't take himself too seriously. That's to his credit, because when your movie is an onslaught of relentless doom, gloom, and death, it helps to toss in a joke or two to help soften the blow or else you end up narrowing your audience down to masochists, suicidal goths, and aging serial killers who miss the good old days.This movie is about a random group of people in Chile who experience a massive earthquake and then must deal with the horrific aftermath, including aftershocks, looting, crumbling buildings, and general anarchy. The movie is notable for refusing completely to follow any kind of traditional story conventions. I can't decide if they were trying to be avant-garde or if they thought it would lend the story (as much as there is any kind of story) more impact, but a lot of choices left me scratching my head. For instance:-- Nothing happens for thirty minutes. We meet three guys -- Gringo is white and Ariel and Pollo are Spanish/Latin American -- who are partying hard down in South America. They party and talk about/hit on girls and dance for about thirty minutes. There are a few stabs at character development (the white guy has a daughter; the fat guy has a rich daddy who's funding his fun; the skinny guy is obsessed with an ex-girlfriend), but mostly nothing happens.-- Approximately 60-70% of the dialogue is in Spanish, and at least in the version of the movie I watched, there were no subtitles. I actually looked around for a version with translations, but I couldn't find any. If you know Spanish, you'll get more of the movie than otherwise. It's not that hard to get the basic gist of what the Spanish-speakers are saying (maybe this decision was meant to make non-Spanish speaking viewers as disoriented as the foreigners in the film), but it is also off-putting.-- Protagonists? Forget about it. There seems like there could be, but ultimately isn't, any kind of lead character that you can hang your hopes on or root for. The film starts by following the three guys, but people join and leave the group intermittently as the disaster causes them to run for their lives. Maybe they thought that if audiences realized anyone could die at any moment then it would give the movie more tension and suspense, but what it really does is make it impossible to get too attached to anyone at all, making the chaos and killing even more mind-numbing.Relentlessly nihilistic to its final frame, this movie is only entertaining if you enjoy watching people suffer for literally no reason at all. At least with the Hostel films (at least the first one), you could argue a point is being made about the corruption of power and wealth, and there's definitely a hero figure who satisfies even a splinter of the audience's empathy. This film, however, has no deeper message (other than that life sucks and then you die) and no satisfying level of personal engagement unless you have the heart of a barbarian and get your kicks from vicarious raping and slaughtering.I give the film points for most of its actors doing decent jobs (Roth's general aura of smugness implies that he's a much better actor than I think he is) and for also pulling off a lot of horrific stuff with an obviously small SFX budget, but the overall film is so brainlessly dark and despondent that it made me wonder how anyone with such a vision in their heads would also have the motivation to put it up on the silver screen. Seems to me anyone with this kind of outlook on life would be more compelled to take a bath with a toaster than actually write a script about it. Movies are usually made to a) tell an interesting story, b) entertain, or c) teach lessons about life. This movie doesn't do any of those things unless you think the cold, tarry abyss of your waiting grave is a) intriguing, b) enjoyable, or c) a profound morality play. If you do, congratulations, you're among this film's target audience and should enjoy it. Otherwise, I'd steer my ship to calmer waters if I were you.",Negative
"UPDATE: I am now able to review on this show from all episodes. I still think it's a great show that has left me with anticipation of where this story is going. But I must say....I knew there was something up with his family & they need to hurry up & get us new episodes so we know what his family is. I have changed from 4 stars (from pilot episode only) to a full 5 stars based on entire 1st season. I hope there is a 2nd season, there are to many shows now that only give you 1 season &/or a story with no ending episode.My review is based on the pilot episode...that's all there is at this time. Personally I enjoyed it however, around almost every corner any fan of Charmed will recognize several things! The set, the story line (remember the girls stuck in the picture?) & right down to the color of the cop. One sister is a bartender, the mom tries to spare the girls from being witches...this won't describe it all. But if you love Charmed, grab this free pilot...it appears to be Charmed revamped at this point.",Positive
"A version of the sons of anarchy,interesting will keep watching it,simply because there aren't  many good programs out there right now.",Positive
"My kids love this show.  When I heard a familiar song in it, I watched and discovered it is from the Mr. Rogers foundation.  A delight to hear these sweet songs again!  It has great messages and songs for young children and not too annoying like some other children's programming...you parents know what I'm taking about!",Positive
"Not willing to let a good thing simply just be, some writers and directors strive for greater relevance.  For them it isn&#8217;t good enough to craft a film about, say, spousal abuse; rather, they strive to craft &#8220;the most didactic piece of art about the horrors of spousal abuse&#8221; when just being about spousal abuse might really be enough, might really say everything that could, should, and would be said about the topic.  Leave well enough alone.  Don&#8217;t try to lace the plot with greater metaphors.  Don&#8217;t try to enamor the feature with probative images.  Figure out what works best in the story, and then drive it home.  At the end of day, everyone will appreciate the work more for staying true to the cause than they will being abused, amused, and confused with theatrical pomp and circumstance.That&#8217;s a lesson the makers and shakers behind DARK TOUCH probably should have heeded.  Instead, they&#8217;ve produced a film about keeping secrets that, while impeccably assembled, feels a bit too impersonal for the subject matter.  Or maybe that&#8217;s just me &#8230;(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)11-year-old Neve (played with solid conviction by the young Miss Keating) has suffered the worst night of her short life &#8230; or has she?  After witnessing the bloody massacre of her parents and infant brother, she&#8217;s taken in by her friendly neighbors while the police conduct their investigation.  However, when it becomes clear that Neve&#8217;s trouble may not have only just begun but also may be following her around, everyone begins to doubt the young girl&#8217;s version of events, and that very well may spell the town&#8217;s unimagined doom.Here&#8217;s the thing: without spoiling it, audiences are given a very clear idea of just who exactly the culprit is in DARK TOUCH from the very beginning.  No, I won&#8217;t ruin it; I&#8217;ll only encourage you to be watching closely from the first scenes, and, like me, you&#8217;ll probably see very much of this one coming.  That isn&#8217;t to say that the film is predictable; I don&#8217;t think it is, but I do think that this idea has been explored before.  Is Neve truly a &#8216;bad seed&#8217;?  That&#8217;s the conceit the filmmakers juggle perhaps too often in bringing this particular story to life.What works here is the young, affable, doe-eyed Missy Keating.  At such an impressionable age, it&#8217;s remarkable how this actress manages to hoist the weight of the film &#8211; all of its ideas, scenes, trickery, and twists &#8211; on her capable shoulders.  She effortlessly leads viewers to see one thing while perhaps suspecting another, and, so long as the script allows, she keeps you guessing quite probably up until the last futile images are committed to celluloid.  And, sure, the players chosen to surround her all turn in some quality work, but theirs is inconsequential (in more ways that I&#8217;ll disclose in this review) when compared against the burden Keating carries consistently.What doesn&#8217;t work is the ever-present tug of war writer/director Marina de Van weaves around the audience.  While her film remains at all times stylish in frame and texture, the script tries all-too-often to pull viewers when it should&#8217;ve pushed &#8230; or, better yet, let them make up their own mind on what&#8217;s happened and how this particular world all came to be.  Because of the Herculean effort put into keeping the final secret just out of reach, I thought it was very easy to see past the misdirects and, instead, see most of this one coming a mile away.  (Make that two miles away!)  Perhaps a script penned with greater nuance and not so much deliberate obfuscation would&#8217;ve worked better or more satisfyingly.DARK TOUCH [2013] is produced by Element Pictures, Eurimages, Ex Nihilo, Film I Vast, Filmgate Films, and the Irish Film Board.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group through IFC Midnight.  As for the technical specifications &#8230; wow!  As I tried to be clear above, this is an immaculately well-produced film with the highest quality sight and sound lending themselves to the exploration of this nightmare.  Indeed, the picture is ripe with some of the most impressive horror cinematography of the last year; I just wish the story could&#8217;ve left out some of the layers.  Sadly &#8211; a huge miss &#8211; there are no special features to speak of, except the relatively predictable theatrical trailer.  Boo!RECOMMENDED but more than a bit frustrating.  At its core, I&#8217;m not entirely convinced I know what happened in DARK TOUCH.  I get that it&#8217;s try very, very hard to be a horror film &#8220;about&#8221; something greater than just the pursuit of horror, but I&#8217;m amiss at exactly what that is.  We all have demons.  We all have things that have happened that might cause us some grief, trauma, or pain &#8230; but not all of us develop psychic powers as a result of them.  Instead of staying true to that central intent (i.e. be relevant), DARK TOUCH has to give in to the path of least resistance in the last act and, essentially, serve up the usual terrorizing trickery; at that point, I figured I must&#8217;ve missed it.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD copy of DARK TOUCH by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",Negative
I can't count the many times my grandson--who just turned three--has watched this video. He watches it over and over.,Positive
"to your sleeping time.  The show is very addictive and intriguing as it keeps you into it throughout every episode.  Of course we have Glenn Close playing as a top notch, take no prisoners and ruthless attorney defending people that were swindled out of their pensions and savings from the corrupt boss played by Ted Danson.  Who also does a wonderful job is his role.  As does the new attorney played by Rose Byrne who starts out as a wide eyed, the world is wonderful person.  But by season end so many things will happen to her that will change not only her views.  But her very way of life as well.An excellent show and an well written and directed first season.  There are so many other characters in the show that do their thing acting as well.  Well worth your buying but rent a couple episodes first to make sure this show is your cup of tea.  Really looking forward to the next season of Damages without a doubt.",Positive

"This show used to be about two guys, one a cocky attorney and one a genius pretending to be an attorney, and it was also about the interesting process of trying to survive as a rookie (with secrets) in a highly competitive law firm, a topic which had never really been explored before. And the writers did a good job, for a while. But - and this is what gave it moral weight - it was also about clients. Clients. That's right, real people, non-attorneys in danger from the law, who needed very good representation to win them justice.Then, as season 2 ground on, this show became only about the war-ing egos WITHIN the law firm, the jostling for power that the writers just make up the rules for as they go along - and it had so many twists and turns that no outcome was ever earned dramatically. It became like watching a bunch of smart alecks exchanging zingers - the equivalent of teenage boys in an alley saying, ""No,YOUR mother eats golf balls."" Or whatever. Gabriel Macht (Harvey) is a very watchable actor, but the writers no longer give his character anything that means more to him than his own vanity. Patrick J. Adams (Mike) is a very limited actor, and he can't convincingly play a hetero guy. He may be one, I don't know or care - but he can't PLAY one. Yet his story arc has degenerated into: ""But Rachel, don't you love me, now that we had completely unconvincing frantic sex in the law library?""We need stories that aren't just about a bunch of overinflated egos vying for dominance in a sterile corporate environment. Ultimately, the human ego is boring. We need stories. There aren't any.",Negative
I'm a big fan of a lot of British TV shows and I like Dominic West.  But I couldn't get into this show at all.  I really wanted to like it but it seemed to be dropping breadcrumbs all over the place and never picking them up.  I suppose I had the wrong expectations going into it.,Negative
"love this series, unfortunately I just cant get enough and the seasons are over, please help a junky out and send me more.",Positive
Excellent writing.  The writers are taken an old idea and making it worth watching.  The actors are making the characters much more real than previous attempts.,Positive
"This is one of our favorite shows and was glad to see it return. I did not purchase the entire season because I can watch it on its programming channel on the computer for free vs paying such a substantial price to buy each episode just to see it without commercials! Not me, I'll suffer through the commercials and watch it on hulu or the computer!",Positive

I can't stop watching it. The acting is fantastic. The story is riveting. I can't say enough good things about this show. Just watch it for yourself. Jessica Lange deserves special mention for her portrayal of sister Jude. Haven't seen her since the 1960's King Kong. Where has she been? What a great actress.,Positive
"For a film with so much buzz, especially for its director and his bag of tricks, `Monsters' is disturbingly ineffective.  I should have listened to my Ammy buddy MKIA, but then again, even he said I may like this.  I wanted to.  While heavily clich&eacute;d, I just wanted this to scare the pants off of me, and we all know that atmosphere is the scariest thing of all; and this film supposedly had a lot of that.It doesn't.Okay, so the film takes place at a time when alien life forms are terrorizing humans.  These gigantic squid like things have been contained in Mexico by a gigantic wall that runs along the Mexican border.  A young photographer is in Mexico chasing after his big break when his plans are derailed by a sudden attack and the need to escort a young woman back to the States (that young woman happens to be the daughter of the photographer's boss).  Their journey back to the States is littered with oddly placed emotional connections and a few scattered attempts to scare us with brief glimpses of alien creatures.Take away the fact that this monster film hardly showcases the actual monsters; the film itself had major promise.  I mean, I'm all for a film about emotional growth and human bonding in the times of trial.  The script itself, while heavily clich&eacute;d, could have really proven deeply arresting, and the final scene is expertly handled (and by final scene I mean just that; the split second before the credits begin to roll).  Still, there are two things that really prohibited this movie from being any good; Scoot McNairy and Whitney Able.  These two actors are atrocious.  I mean, they probably put in the worst performances of the year; period.  There is no chemistry, and the dialog they have to suffer through is horrendous.  I know that this film was done on a small budget, which actually says a lot for the crispness of the scenes (the cinematography is especially marvelous) but you can feel an air of `cheapness' in a lot of the voice over work (I don't know if the sound wasn't good on the original shoot and so they basically dubbed all the dialog, but there are many scenes where the crispness of the vocals is distracting and phony sounding).The `scary' moments are few and far in between, but they are effective to a degree.  The opening scene is pretty great and got my hopes up very high, but in the end `Monsters' barely registers with the viewer save for some beautiful cinematic shots and a shivery score.",Negative
"I bought the entire first season of prime suspect and I must say I enjoyed almost every episode now of course it is written in the typical American television format with typical antagonists and subtexts but I just like Maria Bello so much that I could watch her in just about anything although she is not a classic beauty there is something about her that I find extremely attractive and thus my opinion is probably severely bias but compared to what's on television today I do not think that you will be disappointed in any of the episodes even though the writing is only mediocre you'll see many good character actors who you may have seen in many other television and movie shows this is because like the show itself is just a show that works, the dynamic between her father and her has been used in many different ways in many different police shows but even though it's clich&eacute; it still is rather endearing and just watching the other three or four good character actors practice their craft it's worth a watch I'm not saying it still Street blues more am I saying it's NYPD Blue I'm just saying hey give it a look Maria is very watchable respectfully Johnny Irish",Positive

"One of the best things about DVDs, notably the release of TV series on DVD, is the fact that you actually get a chance to watch some of the best shows on TV that you may have missed the first time around. Such is the case with BIONIC WOMAN.This remake of the hit 70s show that starred Lindsey Wagner (that was a spin off of THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN) updates the original, keeping only what's necessary. Jamie Sommers is young, in love and pregnant. After breaking the news to her boyfriend Will (Chris Bowers), the pair are broadsided on the way home.Damaged to the extent that she might die, Jamie is saved by Will as his true occupation is revealed. The man she thought was a simply college professor actually is a brilliant surgeon who works for a secret government agency. And rather than lose Jamie, Will takes her to their facility and enhances her.While her legs, one arm, one ear and one eye were completely obliterated, this facility replaces them with bionic parts, mechanical computerized parts as well as nano technology that boost her healing. Horrified at first, Jamie begins to accept the new her. When Will is killed by the last candidate for bionics, Sarah Corvus (Katee Sackhoff), Jamie joins the agency that rebuilt her.That's the simple set up for the series. Super strength, eyesight, hearing and more. Working for a government agency. And with a revenge motive strong enough to fill any number of stories. But the series doesn't stop there. As well as her new found life, Jamie has a kid sister to raise. Troublesome and a handful, the teen was dropped at her doorstep by her father and was the reason Jamie stayed where she is. A combination of love and loss revolve between the two.The series takes a natural progression, from Jamie being talked into her new career path to how she deals with Sarah. The series shows her progression, her training and her learning to deal with her abilities. But what makes this series work best is that it's not a straight out remake. Instead, it takes those bones from the original and makes the story it's own.Michelle Ryan stars as Jamie and does a fantastic job, showing a young woman who takes what life throws at her and survives. Miguel Ferrer does his smarmy best as the cold hearted bureaucrat who's in charge. Sackhoff is equally casts as the killer who wants to change but has technology that wasn't perfected within her.Cost of living what it is, there is no way Jamie can have been made for a mere $6 million. Times have changed and so has this show. But that's a good thing. While the original seems silly to look back on now, science fiction fans can find much to enjoy in this one. Look for it on your shelves or add it to your own. It's a series worth having.",Positive
"This is another example of terrible, awful mothers that will do ANYTHING for two minutes of fame, even sacrificing their children in the process. Often times guilty of out right child abuse, these looser's are so desperate for fame, they even allow the human blimp named ""Abby"" to abuse everyone, in every show without ever thinking of anything close to love or pride or protecting those beautiful, talented, wonderful young girls that give so much trying to please everyone else. The same people that get out of the car at accidents to view the carnage, are the same ones that watch this god awful, disgusting program that clearly demonstrates just how low parents can sink for cash or fame.Just AWFUL.",Negative
"This show is a comedic hit that seems to grow funnier with each season.  If you love silly, random comedy, you have to watch Workaholics.  All of the characters are funny in their own ways.  Even the minor characters could easily support their own episodes.  The scenarios are fun and often gross, but no matter what they throw at you, you will laugh.  Yes, it can be a hit or miss comedic situation at times, but something funny (or potentially funny) happens in each scene.WATCH IT!",Positive
This show keeps my wife laughing throughout the show. It is a bit crude but fun to watch. We have not missed a single episode.,Positive
"As I've said in all my reviews, I love the Stargate shows SG-1 and Atlantis, not so Universe.  I like the way they spun off the whole Atlantis discovery as the foundation for extending SG-1 which was great, but ran it's course and was in decline at the end.  It allowed some new characters, albeit with familiar personalities, along with keeping alive some old favorites with vague tie in's to their ongoing lives as well as bringing Samantha Carter back for a season to head the program (in addition to all her guest appearances).  I think the 3rd season of Atlantis was its best.  I knew from the start it would have a shorter shelf life than SG=1 because the premiss had already been pretty thoroughly explored in SG=1. A whole new universe allowed for some new bad guys, but the SG teams and the predicaments they can get into are finite before they are like plots different show.  I enjoyed their greater familiarity with the ancient technology but being Hyperspace or Warp drives, the technology is simply a backdrop to the episode storyline and seasonal/show ones.  I couldn't have stood waiting as long watching Stargate for them to develop defensive technologies and fight the enemies effectively.  I enjoyed the show and season 3 was at its peak as it was becoming a formula rotated through the seasons by season 4 and season 5 it is hard to get enthused when it begins by them canning a long time character who was well liked by fans and characters, replacing her with someone that I would have enjoyed having run Stargate for two shows and then get eaten by a Raithe no matter how much they tried to make it fun watching him have to change his ways to deal with the realities of being in the field.  The characters had become familiar such that losing main ones was difficult in this season making for some heavy shows, but also began the rotation that made it less upsetting when one was lost.  The only thing that sort of always left me in question was how on Atlantis they dealt with exploring an entire Galaxy with a few SG teams while back in the Milky Way they had a ton.  I realize there were more finite resources in the beginning, but by season 3 they had the huge city fairly up and running and enough trade partners to support a much larger military presence which all things considered I think back home on earth they would have been cranking out as many starships as possible because in the big picture they would need a fleet not a couple of ships.  i know they added on, but over years given the stakes I believe an international governing body would be funding mass production of those things so there was always one by earth, one by Atlantis and others for missions and with force.  It is part of what started to become a little to familiar, the desperate situation with impossible odds solved by a miraculous discovery at the last minute.  Great for a show, or a movie, but when it becomes cyclical it eventually translates to a show formula and the interest just begins to wane.  I did appreciate the writing around the problems they faced were of their own making many times (waking the wraithe early, messing with the replicator programming, genetic experiments on the wraithe to make them human) and the moral questions they raise in parallel with the real world application of genetics.  How much knowledge is to much before we are dabbling in areas we don't have enough seem to be evolved enough to have in our hands as they represent to much power, to much danger.  But for Star Gate fans I think Atlantis was a comfortable spin off that allowed a few more years of enjoyment of their &#34;world&#34; but unlike the Star Trek franchise that dealt with all universes the &#34;world&#34; created via the stargates became to self contained limiting the growth of the plots.  Bottom line is by this season you know what your getting and enjoying it, where in the seasons to come it started to get old and thus the show faded away.  Good, even great for periods, but limited from the start by being set in the present.  Great run while it lasted.",Positive

I usually like the paranormal shows but this one was just bad.  The Wraith how bad can an interview be?  The whole story and the acting was very much lacking in everything.  Definitely not worth spending time watching and I want my 1.99 back.  This is the first time I really disliked something bad enough to write a negative review.  Don't waste time...there are much better shows out there.,Negative
One of the best series on television. Season one was a little slow. Season two picked up the pace and now season three... amazing! The actors on this series are awesome. They do an amazing job making their characters real. The writing is excellent. Make up is superb. These zombies scare me. I noticed more gore in this season. I liked how this season is showing more of the human response to the zombie apocalypse. Not everyone who survives is going to be good. Not every good survivor will stay good. Writing this into the show makes it more realistic. I could say more but do not want to give out any spoilers. Overall this is an excellent series that just keeps getting better.,Positive
This season was better than season 3 which was boring as hell. Brought back  a lot of players from the first 2 seasons and got rid of a boring person from the third season. This show had good twists and a shocking ending. Wrapped everything up nicely.Overall a good series.,Positive

"I bet this is the kind of show actors thumb-wrestle their agents to get into: a chance to play a different role in every episode.  Subtle writing, lurking secrets, and explosive action make even jaded viewers like me hang on.  I only wish the performances were on par with the background.  Then this merely good show could be great.Deep beneath Los Angeles, a shadowy organization uses advanced tech to reprogram human beings into whatever they need to be.  Working at once to evade the law and to get immensely rich, the Dollhouse promises the moon to anybody who can afford to pay.  What they can't promise is that they can control the implications.Series principal Eliza Dushku is an odd choice on which to hang an action drama.  The role was created for her, and it plays to her strengths, letting her be essentially vacant as the camera longingly admires her body and her fighting chops.  The show operates at its peak when the camera turns its gaze on the other actors.And what a supporting cast.  Harry Lennix, Olivia Williams, and Tamoh Penikett lead an ensemble through the kind of paces that must make Equity lawyers see dollar signs, from action to romance to comedy and back.  They are capable of so much, but the camera so loves Dushku that they get far too little face time.The story benefits from Joss Whedon's distinctive humor and eye for an off-kilter story.  But not every actor is up to Whedon's particular demands.  Fran Krantz in particular wants to overplay the humor, and winds up mugging for the camera, while Miracle Laurie, so good in the dramatic and romantic scenes, sucks laughter away like a comedy Hoover.Moreover, the show's political implication, that technology's force panders to human weakness, is good but overplayed.  At various points, different characters state the series thesis explicitly, apparently because the creators think we're too thick to put the pieces together.  Considering how subtle the story is, the moral should be equally restrained.This show will likely be remembered as one of TV's great ""Almost-Was"" moments.  Like Whedon's other lost classic, Firefly, people will talk about it in wishful tones, mourning all the missed potential.  I enjoy the show's smart intensity, but it should be so much better than it ultimately proves to be.",Negative
"This is an excellent movie.  It is not the ""chucky"" horror flick, it is heavy duty drama which in its own way is a ""horror flick"".  The actors were excellent and the story good.  It's story that fringes on true horror. The evil intentions of one in authority manipulating the innocent towards the destruction of their own soul; by committing atrocious vile acts against others.  I gave this movie five stars for the extremely talented Actors, Director and Writer of this film. I had almost forgotten what a really good movie was...",Positive
"What is it about this competition that I just can't stop watching? I've even spent lots of time discussing each episode in detail with others, who are all similarly addicted. The skill of the dancers is Heaven to watch. They are sweet, real kids who obviously love what they do and want very badly to please the judges and parents.However, Abby Lee Miller's character unfolds as increasingly abrasive. At times she loses my admiration as a dedicated teacher. Instead, I sometimes view her as a narcissistic parent pitting one child against the other to hold her approval. The Moms, however, are often more childish than their offspring. Please make note I called them childish, not childlike!In the end, it is the children who bring me back for every single episode. Will their constant efforts to succeed get them past the manipulations and warfare of the adults around them? And, make no mistake, this is a skill they must develop very well, because the world of professional dance is cut-throat. No one will stop to pat your head and hold your hand at an audition.",Positive
Only watched one episode. it was too political for my taste. but i'll give another chance after I finish Game of Thrones.,Negative
very good educational TV viewing. ;I like these kind of shows and this one is on my sist of science shows to watch.,Positive
I never get tired of this show. I think it will go down in history with a following like Seinfeld!,Positive
"This was my first test movie, and it was more enjoyable than I thought it would be, given some of the other reviews of test movies I've seen.  I guess you just need to realize that this isn't a completed, polished movie.The animation and voice work was better than I thought it would be.  The premise of the story was interesting, and although I think a few areas of the script could use some work, I'd rate this as a positive experience.  It was loads better and more interesting than a lot of the movies shown on places like SyFy.  The ""love story"" needs a little more development, as does Blue's initial choice regarding Tyler. I was left scratching my head at that particular point in the script.  The typical Hollywood shortcuts were taken for the ""romance"", which I don't think presented Blue well.  It came across as more of ""I'll love whoever can touch me without giving me pain"", than about Tyler.  The ""twist"" wasn't very surprising to me, but I thought it was well played within the script, and actually made sense.  The ending leaves things open for a sequel, but also makes sense, given the hope presented to all Screamers during the final act.All in all, I'll be watching and reviewing other test movies.  Good job to all involved, and good luck with your project!",Positive
Scary and funny.,Positive
"This show is great.  Just when you think you figure out where the plot is going, it takes a twist or turn.  The show is fun!",Positive
I have grown tired of the series.  I will not finish it.,Negative
porsha porsha porsha!  lmfaoooooooooooooooooooo rofl. yaaaaaasssssssssss! hahahahaha. Good season cant wait til season 7 lets goooooooo! I am ready darling .,Positive
It kills me how parents act when they'er kids do something. they need to sit down and shut up. they pay her to teach them to dance then they complain about her teaching them,Positive
"I found the premise intriguing so gave it a try. History is presented in story form by actors who are totally tanked. As a non-drinker myself, I had low expectations of a show centered around alcohol. I'm almost embarrassed to say it - I'm crazy about this informative, yet comedic series.  Looking forward to season 2!",Positive
"I do miss Rory and Amy but I am really looking forward to watching the Doctor running to keep up with Clara, what ever version of her he is dealing with at the time. Jenna plays Clara/Oswin with style and an impudence to match the Doctor. I love this show and have for much of the last 42 years of my life. The 4th Doctor, Tom Baker, set the hook when I was a kid and the 9th, Chris Eccleston, 10th, David Tenant, and the 11th, Matt Smith, have made it so much fun that I recommend this to strangers as my friends already have heard about this from me.Don't take my word for it. Watch it and decide for yourself.",Positive
"During the first season - and even though I saw the mature audience rating - I was a little shocked at the material. BUT ..by the time I got to season 3, I felt tied in to the characters and was rooting for Grace to face her demons. Earl is my new favorite angel!!! I later watched all of the seasons available and was sad to see it end.",Positive
Good show to watch with the family. Shows how a group of people come together to stop an Alien force.,Positive
"Would have given a 5 stars,  but the profanity and sex scenes I don't feel comfortable watching with grandchildren and other family members!",Positive
"This is going to be a great series!!  I can't wait to see the next episodes.  I have seen the characters in other series/movies, and there are quality actors in this drama.  The characters have texture, and the storyline is believable.  I love crime dramas, and I never get enough.  I just hope we won't have to wait long for the next installment!!",Positive
These are OK shows...some of them seem a little hokey. I used this show as a filler when Paranormal Witness goes on hiatus. It was not as fulfilling or very scientific based.,Negative
Love the actors. It is very raw. The way it probably was to a large degree. The relationships are very interesting. I was sad that the lead guy left his beautiful wife. I like the wife and I totally understand her needing to give it up and walk away after another woman bares his child.,Positive
"What's going to happen next .. In this season after (spoiler) finding a planet which they can live on things happen that they have to leave it and keep on the search for earth.. There are many problems on season 3 that has you thinking of human life, based on the show and what flips are next to be shown on season 4.. Overall a great season .. So far this show has me hooked..",Positive
"This is a rare sort of film. Its visuals are stunning - including a long trek through a jungle at night and a woman who has intercourse with a water pond. It is metaphysical. As our hero approaches death, he is joined by his dead wife who is visible not only to him but to his younger siblings as well. He is visited also by a son who is now a red-eyed, shaggy-haired beast. Do not expect continuity, just revel in the visuals as they are given to you, and think about it later. This is a truly original film. Watch and enjoy.",Positive
"The quality is as good as can be expected from a 10-year-old cartoon, but it plays smoothly.  One odd complaint--the Nickelodeon &#34;intro&#34; is MUCH louder than the rest of the cartoon for some reason, and that's consistently true across all of the Dora and Diego cartoons.  When watching you may want to adjust the volume down (or mute) until the intro is done to save your TV speakers and possibly your ears.  The cartoon itself is cute and well-structured for younger children, that eventually understand what Dora is asking for and the order in which things happen on the show.  My 2-year-old girl loves it and would watch an entire season straight through if I'd let her.  It's the first cartoon like this to really capture her attention for an entire episode so that alone makes it worth the recommendation for younger children.",Positive
This show is without a doubt the funniest show on TV. (Okay that's a bit biased) Maybe only ONE of the funniest shows on TV but it's definitely in the running for Funniest.,Positive
"whitechapel's second season is a complete surprise: historical fiction, the swingin 6os, london, england, take its darkest, most corrupt and chilling chapter, ending with the iconic murder of the 1960s, see if you can catch it. great stuff.  if you like luther, you will enjoy this whitechapel season, lots.",Positive
"I loved this show from the first season. However. this seven and final season, collected in this dvd set,  seemed disjointed, over-played  and lost direction of the original show's concept. I know every good show has to change, but this went a total 360 and tried to alienate its fans with this season's grittier edge.. Micheal's deep undercover mission would have been great for another show, not for Burn Notice. Show creator and producer Matt Nix just went too far off the basic concept and its showsThe cast was and is amazing.This is one great reason to get this set. The acting is never better. Jeffrey Donovan as Micheal Weston leads this cast so well. Gabrielle Anwar (Fi),Bruce Campbell (Sam), Sharon Gless (Maddy), and Coby Bell ( Jesse) blend so great together.The highlight of this season is the casting of John Pyper-Ferguson who is larger than life villian,  James Kendrick. When he is on screen, his powerful and hypnotic presents compells you to watch. His character is only in six episodes, you can wish he was in moreThe fatal twist is a death is the last episode of a beloved character to save the rest of the group. I felt the death of unneeded and was a waste. It is an emotional turning point in the final episode, this  after last year death of Micheal's brother Nate . This character unselfish act is something you would not see coming, since all these character have cheated death all seven seasons.One note, with only one commentary of the forget me not episode makes me wish they did a few more commentary, especially since this was the show's final season.This is one show I would love , in five years,  to see a reunion movie and find out where many of these character are.RIP Burn Notice ..you were great escapist TB for seven season..ThanksBennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD",Negative
I thought this was an excellent assessment of our value system in assessing level of happiness.  I would recommend it to all.  Especially those who believe that you need &#34;things and money&#34; to be happy which are fleeting and temporary.,Positive
"My 5 yr old and twin 2 yr olds love this show, very imaginative and entertaining!! Educational as well, love it!",Positive
I love Sci-fi so this show is right up my alley. Great FX and two great lead characters make for entertaining TV. Karl Urban and Michael Ealey are very effective in their roles as Detective John Kennex and his unique android partner Dorian. Their chemistry is already evident and I hope they get  the chance to hang around and explore it further. It would be nice to get to know some of the other characters in the show as well.,Positive
"This overall is an honest, good show.  You get to see real law enforcement at work and real criminals which is eye opening sometimes.",Positive
Timothy Olyphant....what more is there to say!  The plots are fun and the dialog is great with many lines that make you chuckle.I love the verbal sparring between &#34;Boyd Crowder&#34; and &#34;Marshall Raylan Givens&#34; & Timothy Olyphant!,Positive
I like the characters and the plots are wonderful.  It definitely keeps you interested in what is happening and going to happen.,Positive
"i think i got so weary of elliot stabler's same old-same old week in and week out that i, surprisingly, don't seem to miss him this season.  I've watched every episode of every season, including this one.  The two new detectives are fine but, frankly, I would be happier if they just used Ice T more.  Belzer too.  I've always thought those two weren't used enough.the olivia role is fine and mariska is doing fine with it.as to this episode it involves a couple who have just driven into NYC.  they claim their baby was hijacked along with the car.  the police immediately suspect that one or both of them has murdered the baby instead. instead of doing the predictable plot arc with this story, I was surprised to discover that there was a rather new plot twist I hadn't seen before.  So this episode was quite good.",Positive
"As a fifty year veteran and fan of Science Fiction (before SyFy or Scifi became fashionable), watching Buster Crabbe in Flash Gordon and shudder (dating myself) the 'Space Cadets' on B&W; TV, becoming an avid reader in early 1960's of science fiction books after reading my first Lensman story by 'E.E. 'Doc' Smith &#60;Grey Lensman, if you must know, and if you don't find the series in the Library and read all the books in Order&#62;, and providing this background since it is really hard to find something 'NEW' or 'Refreshing New Idea' like you'll see in &#34;The After&#34;.The Event may start a little slow, and it may not quite make sense (at first), but the entire show, with their 'Ending for episode #1) certainly hooked me.  Am look forward to other shows; where the highest tribute that I can pay is: 'If I could buy the entire 1st Season to have this story- I would actually buy it.  ( And I normally would not consider 'Buying' a TV show, shown by watching one show of 'Eureka', then waited over a YEAR to see an entire season, starting from the 'First Episode' )We may be disappointed,, it happens,, but sure is worth the time if you are a Science Fiction Fan.  Original story, complex interesting characters,'",Positive
"I do subscribe to this show through Amazon so it was not too surprising when a new one showed up off the weekly cycle.  It turned out that this episode is a prequel to the series and is only 19 minutes long, even though it still costs $1.89.  It tells the story of Augie learning to cope with being a blind agent handler. It takes place in Barcelona and since I haven't been there in 45 years I found the travelogue aspect beautiful.  The story is sort of weak, given that we already had one show about Augie getting blinded in Iraq.  Annie the usual heroine is not in this at all.  It is an OK sort of clip but not worth the price of a full episode.",Negative

"Was shocked to hear Harvard-type people depicted using such low, deplorable language; certainly can't use that language in the average job--nor in a court room.  Why is it in there? A few awkward scenes.  Seems like a particular actress' episodes are awkward more often.  Disappointed that the writers don't realize how good they are without unnecessary contrivances to vulgarity; definitely hate the use of &#34;GD&#34;, &#34;BS&#34; and such detracts from the overall quality.",Negative
"I tried to not let the fact that Michael Lehmann directed this pilot sway me one way or the other. Fortunately, I liked it anyway. I do not watch ""The Big Bang Theory,"" but I have the feeling that this could be the show that that one tries to be. The characters here seemed very drawn out and the acting was good, considering that this is a comedy pilot. It was not as funny as I was hoping (there's only on 'Workaholics,"" after all), but I would definitely tune in if this were an on-going series.",Positive
"When these first came out, I couldn't get interested because they weren't as good as *Morse*, but I came back to them later and realized the writing has a lot of the qualities that made me like *Morse*.

It is too contrived and really does not get better with more exposure. I regret buying the season. Don't bother.,Negative
I got into this show after the 2nd season and never looked back! It was very intense and exciting. WOW,Positive
Good show Jon is awesome,Positive
"Note: I saw every episode of ONCE UPON A TIME Season III with XFinity On Demand.After a literal shipsailing into an unknown Neverland at the end of Season II, Season III kicks things into high gear by soaring to new and hitherto unexplored heights. Shocking revelations are made, people you've grown to love (or hate) die, and it all comes back to the central premise: There's No Place Like Home. That is just the tip of the iceberg. I can't say anymore, as it would spoil the fun. Every episode fits neatly into the thread woven by Mr. Kitsis & Mr. Horowitz. Miss one thread, and you'll be in a tangle.'The fun isn't just the destination. It's the getting there.'ONCE UPON A TIME has been renewed for a fourth season.",Positive
"Bets finally finds out a few things about her husband, Don continues to cheat on her while she does the same, the kids suffer in the process, the British owners of Sterling Cooper shake things up at the firm, Sal can't hide his gay identity forever, Peggy really comes into her own, Joan must deal with her husband's failings, JFK's presidency comes to an end, the Civil Rights movement is well underway, and the acting and production design are still as strong as ever in this, the third season of Mad Men.Bets is still unlikeable: cold, mean, unappreciative of her kids and always making them go outside or upstairs or to the tv room to avoid interacting with them, and yet you can't help feeling some sympathy for her.  Don is gone most of the time, doing as he pleases, though he forbids his wife to do the same.  The Draper kids get more screen time as well.Things have changed so much for the agency and for the Drapers by the time we reach the finale that it really makes a fan wonder where it will all go from here.

I like Joaquin. Movie wasn't like the most magical movie ever but worth watching. Maybe it should have been called 1.5 lovers ha.,Positive
The best comedies are caricatures of life. The Senators portrayed in Alpha House are less caricature and more true to reality to be funny. The show just magnifies the sad state of American politics today. Don't think it would last a season.,Negative
Truly enjoyed this series and watched it up to the 4th but was left hanging.  Wish the TV stations wouldn't do this all the time.,Positive
"We really love this show.  Amazon has random seasons on here for prime viewers, but it doesn't really matter with this show since each episode is pretty much stand alone.  We really like HGTV and without cable it's nice that Amazon Prime has a handful of their shows on here.  I just hope they get more soon!",Positive

He was even talking to the lady=TARDIS, or I think that's what was happening -- fun fun fun!",Positive
"Centurion, a Roman empire epic set in Britain in 117 AD, has many of those qualities we see in the best of this genre: A plot line as empty as Gladiator's; self-polishing abs breast plates for all officers; and Life of Brian's attention to historical accuracy. It adds blood arcing for some distance into the sky when a lance meets an eyeball. And there are two feral lady barbarians, one blond with what looks like bad teeth (Aeron, played by Axelle Carolyn) and one brunette, whose teeth look just fine, as do her breasts (Etain, played silently by Olga Kurylenko). The brunette fancies skins when she goes out hunting Romans in the deep winter forest and scanty skins when in a hut.Centurion, in other words, is as silly as they come. Briefly, it's about an attempt by the Ninth Legion, led by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West), to march north into what is now Scotland and eliminate the Pict threat. Evidently Virilus never read up on the fate of Publius Quinctilius Varus, no general but a good administrator. Marching deep into the Teutoburg Forest in what is now Germany, he and his three legions were attacked by combined Germanic tribes. Varus committed suicide in the middle of the battle. His three legions disintegrated. Probably 20,000 or more Roman soldiers died compared to a handful of barbarians.General Virilus, virile and confidant, who didn't read his history, marches his men into the thick forests of Pictland.  Flash forward to the next day. Virilus is in chains in the squalid camp of the Pict king. Most of his men have been slaughtered. Later, a handful of survivors led by Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) try to rescue him. No luck. The Pict king's young son is killed and the general dies in a forced fight with Etain. The seven Romans escape and head south with a handful of Pict hunters (led by Etain and Aeron) hot on their trail. Pict hunters die one by one; the Roman seven almost die one by one.What's good about Centurion? The make-up and the set-designer. Picts look as dirty and flea-bitten as their filthy encampments. Most of the Romans look as filthy as the Picts. There are stunning, craggy, shivering cold scenes of the Highlands.What lacks in Centurion? Characters we can give even a small hoot for. Most of the time we can't remember one from another. Fassbender seems to be a rising star, but all he's called upon to do in this movie is fight, run monotonously and look tired. Only one actor in the cast stands out as tough and smart, and that is that fine actor Liam Cunningham. He's made a lot of drek, but look for him inShooting the Past,Dog SoldiersandThe Wind That Shakes the Barley. The movie's battle scenes, particularly Virilus' march north, is shot only to show slashing swords and more spurts of blood. There's no way to follow the battles. A plot also is lacking. The first third is an excuse for gore. The last two-thirds is an excuse for gore and long-distance running. The roles of Etain and Aeron are a sop to the 18-29-year-old audience the director seems to care most for.Centurion is not a movie. It's a mediocre comic book for all those who love abs-enhancing armor, horsehair helmet crests and the inspiring National Geographic maps showing the Roman Empire at its greatest extent.",Negative
"For some people the truth can be subjective but not for Dr. Cal Lightman (Tim Roth). In the second season of the popular series ""Lie to Me"" Lightman and his associates use their skills at reading people to separate fact from fiction in helping to solve a variety of crimes from the disappearence of a amateur poker player about to win againt a quartet of professional players to determining if an executed man really did kidnap children murder them (his last facial expressions and words indicate otherwise and Lightman's testimony is what helped get him executed).The second season is marred only by the inclusion of a wealthy former client Clara Musso (Melissa George)who becomes a benefactor of The Lightman Group when Cal gives pays out his ex-wife for her half of the group in order to help her have her own law practice and prevent her from moving away. George is a marvelous actress but the character of Musso is an annoying intrusion adding nothing to the show aside from eye candy. Her three episode story arc is mercifully short and it probably doesn't help that her character is introduced in one of the weakest episodes of the bunch (although it does allow for plenty of verbal sparring between Roth as Lightman and Jennifer Beals as his ex-wife). One of the stronger series of episodes establishes a new love interest for Dr. Gillian Foster (Kelli Williams) that falls victim to Cal's obsessive need to know everyone's dirty laundry and the mysterious past of her boyfriend (Mark Martinni).Roth continues to do a spectacular job of playing a complex anti-hero of sorts; he often comes across as rude, overbearing and a know-it-all. It's easy to see why Lightman appeals to audiences as he's a complex character that some people love-to-hate.Fox has done a nice job of packaging the second season. All the episodes look quite nice with a sharp clean presentation of the show. We also get some nice extras with the second season set. Aside from the usual extras that many sets have such as a gag reel and deleted scenes, we also get a good featurette entitled ""Dr. Ekman/Dr. Lightman Lie Detection Tutoral"". Ekman is the inspiration for the Lightman character and a consultant on the show (he also appeared in the pilot episode). We also get a featurette ""Eli Loker: An Honest Man"" focusing on the employee that Lightman likes to pick on the most. ""Dr. Ekman's Blog"" is also included that gives us a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the show. Unfortunately, Fox has elected not to include any commentary tracks and there is no featurette focusing on the slight change in the character dyanmics during season two.The second season of ""Lie to Me"" features some strong episodes and although a bit uneven (especially compared to the first) the show more than holds its own. The DVD set is reasonablly priced and while it could have more special features focusing on the production of the show, etc., what we do get is quite nice.I can honestly (really!)recommend this set for fans of the first season but would suggest those coming to the show late may want to pick up the first season setLie to Me: Season Oneon DVD or the Blu-rayLie To Me: Season One [Blu-ray] and then dive into this set after they've completed season one.",Positive

"I see a bad moon rising! This song describes Season 3 for me.You would think by now the heroes have accepted their abilities but they are still battling the demons within themselves.If you have a gift, an ability,a power,wouldn't you want to use it for good instead of getting rid of it?This is the 21st century,having powers shouldn't shock the world.I for one will gladly accept it.Why not?Also,why did they have to give Suresh and Ando powers when they are perfectly fine being normal.Everybody doesn't have to be superheroes.Noah Bennett isn't and he is as capable as they are.He doesn't need super strength to catch bad guys.Overall though,Heroes will always be a favorite show of mine.All the characters are likeable.With that said, on to Season 4 I go!",Positive
"I started out loving the show even though I had to hide my eyes during the gory scenes (and there are LOTS) of them. But when many of the most interesting characters died, I just couldn't watch anymore. It became a downer for me, as if there were no hope for anyone. Ever.",Negative
"This was a great series.  Good acting and taunt storyline.  I liked it so much I was wondering if there were more episodes out there, but apparently 12 episodes is the max.  That would be season 1 and 2 on Amazon.  There was conclusion in the last episode of Season 2 which was a good thing.  I really hate watching a BBC crime series and the season ends with a cliff hanger, and guess what?  No more seasons available...That's just wrong.If you like police centered crime dramas, then this is for you.  It was very well done, with edge of the seat suspense, and excellent acting. All those factors made it a five star series.",Positive
As with any extended series the fringe characters get a lot of development and this is the case here.  Really adds a lot to the series.,Positive

"The acting is very good, the special effect excellent, and the stories very well written. There's a continuing theme running through this series, so we get revelations here and there, which I enjoy. Each episode has a story complete in itself too. The stars are lots of fun, especially the lead, Nick, and the Monroe characters, the latter being a lovable, vegetarian werewolf who has decided he must resist the urge to kill. Both of the stars' live-in girlfriends are really good characters too. It's a fun show that has, at least to date, kept the quality high and the action fast-moving. I rate it as one of my two favorite series, the other being &#34;Sleepy Hollow.&#34;",Positive
"Samantha Brown is delightful in showing us around the different areas.  She's witty and cheerful while being subtly candid as to problems a less than a seasoned world traveler might have.

"This series started as one of the best 10 new TV series coming out but then again so did the Playboy Club which only lasted three episodes. Pan Am lasted 14 episodes with high ratings at 11.06 million but by the 12th episode it was down to 3.74 million (Wiki source). The cast while mostly not known big time (with the exception of maybe Christina Ricci) were attractive and charming and mostly suited for the period. So why did a TV series that opened it's first season with a $10M budget fail to keep going? One stewardess became a spy for the CIA (which was partly based on fact), another ends up dating an Arab prince, another is a liar with a past she doesn't want exposed and still another is the hot blonde who is trying to find meaning in her life. Amidst all of this are romances with various male passengers and pilots as well as the historical scope of the 1960s, including JFK's visit to Berlin and his later assassination. Sexism, racism and many of those others things we see in Mad Men are apparent but more subdued by comparison. And then there were some of the radical movements for the decade, like focuses on interracial lovers and posing nude for the sake of it being art, not pornography. The costumes and set were impressive and one of the executive producers had a background as a Pan Am stewardess. Nitpickers will note that the pilots are too young to be flying but you have to remember this was something of a ""Mad Men"" add on and they were trying to get younger viewers to watch a recently historical period. Well, maybe they should have tried harder because it didn't work. I suspect ""older"" Americans didn't want to watch a new TV show and the younger crowd saw it as a period of time that was charming but not engaging enough when there were so many other choices out there.I personally felt it was too safe and the issues it covered while radical back in the 1960s are now mainstream and mostly not controversial for people watching it today, especially those who weren't really around in the 60s as adults like myself. The quality of some of the subplots dipped in the middle, too. All said, though, I suspect it had more to do with the creators not pushing this series forward enough and making it edgy. Pan Am played it too safe and that's why it eventually had to be grounded.CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; THEMES/FOCUSES OF THE 1960s: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: 2011 to end of March 2012 (streamed).",Positive
"A very interesting series.We have seen both seasons and I can say that they topped the first season with AHS: Asylum. the performances by the actors, and actresses were all top notch. Can't wait for season three AHS: Coven.",Positive
"Once you have watched the first season, this second season is a must.  Different situation & characters but the same type of action, edge of your seat action.  Great Show!",Positive
"Lacks new refreshing script. Lead male always angry, lead female dense as a granite boulder. Actually you could say the script is corruption at its finest.",Negative
I just happened on this series as recommended for me by Amazon. And I'm glad I did. I don't know if their premises are true but the actors really make you believe they are. Worth watching.,Positive
This is one of those great MST3K shows where the movie is so bad and the commentary is so ripe that it all meshes together to produce the perfect storm.I always have this inner conflict going between the Joel Hodgson shows and the Mike Nelson shows.  But this one is a classic in either category.,Positive
"I liked the book, and although there are differences in the show, it's still entertaining.  The acting is pretty solid, especially by the main characters.",Positive
"Season 3 of The Walking Dead simply blew two out of the water, if you ignore the very very lackluster finale. That was the only disappointment to an otherwise wonderful season. The build up and things done in the finale were just mediocre at best, especially the Andrea crap. But otherwise it was a wonderful season I'll sure be watching a few times.",Positive
"This cartoon is so much fun to watch.  My grandchild enjoys the 'plot', music, colors, shapes, and the business of the characters!  It's entertaining and a good learning tool for shapes, designs/colors, and measurements for toddlers.  Strongly recommend it, you won't regret purchasing it for your child or children.",Positive
"It's fair to say that we may have vampire overload in today's media.  It seems every year, a new vampire movie comes out with its own twist on Bram Stoker's character.  Some don't even bother and just create their own character.  In short, our fascination with these immortal bloodsuckers, just like their appetite for blood, has not yet been satiated.  Vampires are cool!Awakened from deep sleep by Abraham Van Helsing, Dracula makes his way to England, posing as American Entrepreneur, Alexander Grayson.  The two men are on a mission to take down the &#34;Order of Draco&#34;.  The Order was responsible for the deaths of both men's loved ones.  Using extortion, bribery, and murder as its tools of the trade, the Order continues to grow ever more powerful.  Intent on keeping the Order from controlling the world petroleum supplies, Grayson and Van Helsing secretly work to undermine the actions of the Order.  Helped along by his able manservant, Renfield, Grayson slowly integrates himself into Victorian England's upper class.There's plenty of violence here.  Graphic violence.  This is not a show for young children.  Here, Dracula not only fights with his teeth under cover of the night, but also within corporate boardrooms, dark bedrooms, and London's upper class hang outs.  Jonathan Rhy-Myers' vampire is part Gordon Gecko, wheeling and dealing his way to power.  However, his genius is undeniable as he gets closer to his goals of developing a source of free energy to break oil's hold on the economy.Joining Myers is Thomas Kretschman, Jessica De Gouw, Victoria Smurfit, Nonso Anozie, and the very beautiful Katie McGrath.  Smurfit, as a vampire huntress, perhaps has been getting the most opportunity to showcase her talents.  Here, she plays Lady Wetherby as a very athletic and very deadly hunter, more deadly than those she hunts.  Kretschman and Anozie, both veteran actors, have both been doing an excellent job playing off of Myers during their scenes.This is a very satisfying show.  I am enjoying this show and &#34;Sleepy Hollow&#34;.  In my opinion, the two best shows to come out in 2013.",Positive
can hardly wait for the new episodes to return and finish will keep watching until the series ends. great series.,Positive
The behavior is irrational and unpleasant to watch.  Too deep for my taste.  I like to be entertained rather than trying to figure out the plot or trying to explain to myself the rational for the behavior of the characters.,Negative
"I strongly recommend this show to most viewers of age.The show itself is an amazing experience.I just wish this show would continue on and on.The characters have just a distinct personality .. which I've enjoyed,Something crazy good different !",Positive
Great collection of movie trivia all about Heston.  He was an interesting character in his own life!,Positive
"After watching seasons 1 & 2 free of charge, courtesy of Amazon Prime; I felt compelled to purchase the 3rd season so I could watch it right away. This series is quite honestly one of the finest that I've ever seen. Never a dull moment; the writing and acting are beyond first rate. After watching the series &#34;Breaking Bad,&#34; I didn't think it was possible for another show to come close to its excellence. Although the two series are completely unrelated; I believe that the writing and acting on both are equally compelling. Unlike &#34;Breaking Bad,&#34; there's no violence in &#34;Suits.&#34; Every aspect of this series is exceptional. It's not just a compelling drama; it's also a comedy of sorts, with the underlying humor being absolutely phenomenal. I can't recommend this series highly enough. Once you start watching it; you'll be glued to your seat for every episode.",Positive
I enjoyed this final season and liked the way the writers completed the circle of the story of the relationships between the characters.  It has been very entertaining  mixing drama at times  with comedy and some real hilarious situational comedy.,Positive
"This documentary by Matthew Cooke, provides a well-researched template for going into business, albeit an illegal one.  Depending on financing, location, desire and determination, we see various stages of selling.  From the stoop in the hood to international cartel chief, complete with his own army.  People who have been at the various stops are interviewed.  Some are famous (50 Cent), some not unless you were in the business.  Cooke, provides graphics and although the film has its tongue firmly in cheek, the data seems accurate and is supported by numerous talking heads.  The most credible are drug impresarios Bobby Carlton, Pepe, Freeway Rick Ross, Brian O'Dea and others.The real theme of the film however is how the ""War on Drugs"" has been an utter failure in all ways.  Increased incarceration including long sentences for relatively minor crimes.  Drug use has continued to increase, billions of dollars are spent to no avail.  The other point Cooke wants to make and does, is that addiction is bad.  Ask Eminem who provides a vivid description of what he went through.  Or Bobby Carlton and others who sampled too much of their own product.  For anyone following the drug wars ever since Nixon implemented it in the 1970's, none of this is new.  But this is an entertaining and effective way to get across the message.",Positive
I think this series is very worth watching. All of the actors and actresses do a great job. I would recommend this to others.,Positive
"I thinkn this show is excellent on multiple levels.  As the storyline driven show - it is very well done with the two main chactarers having very different lives and how each deals with them.  On the musicians side _since I'm a musician_ I like seeing just how ruthless and so chiseled in stone the whole Nashville music scene is.  If you want to do something NOT in the Nashville labels &#34;Okay List&#34;, then you dont get support, or perhaps not even signed or recorded at all.",Positive
"I've read a couple of true-crime books from Stephen Williams, probably the guy on the planet who knows the most about Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo, AKA Leanne Bordelais and Paul Teale.  ""Invisible Darkness"" was a gripping read, while ""Karla:  Deal with the Devil"" wasn't quite as good, as the second book was a little too scattershot to enjoy, if one may ""enjoy"" reading a book about serial killers.But in those books, Mr. Williams indicts not only Ms. Bordelais and Mr. Teale, but he indicts the Canadian judicial system and the police as well.  The police liked to change their stories during the trials of the married couple -- they were tried separately near Toronto -- and the police used whatever narrative that they believed would be the most helpful at the time.  ""Ms. Homolka is an evil monster,"" during her own trial, followed by, ""Ms. Homolka is was an abused wife of a sociopathic monster,"" at Mr. Bernardo's trial.  And the police and judicial system convinced psychiatrists to give both sides of the story as well.How did they do this?  Well, the police had their own agendas, and so did the judicial system.  But so did the psychiatrists.  And this is what I actually thought of immediately when Laurence Fishburne is discussing strategy in a recent episode of ""Hannibal"" with two psychiatrists that work for Mr. Fishburne:  Mads Mikkelsen -- AKA Dr. Hannibal Lecter -- and Caroline Dhavernas -- Dr. Alana Bloom.  Well, Mr. Lecter gives the answer that fits Mr. Fishburne's ""agenda"" -- Mr. Fishburne's words and not mine -- the best.  Guess who Mr. Fishburne ultimately listened to for advice?And this, in a nutshell, is one reason why I really like this series.  It is very realistic in the sense that the characters have their own agendas, and they may be more than willing to discuss those agendas and push them in this fine television show.  But there is something else that they do that's really smart here.  Even though the audience knows that Dr. Lecter is a really bad guy -- or at least will become one as this is a prequel to the movies -- he's oddly more of a sympathetic character when juxtaposed against Ms. Dhavernas.  She seems to have an agenda as well, and that agenda seems to be purely political.  And everybody hates a weasel like her.  So it's pretty danged nifty how they make the audience like a serial killer such as Mr. Lecter more than someone like Ms. Dhavernas.  Nice trick.And the lead -- Hugh Dancy -- is also really good.  He's always on edge, but he's supposed to be.  You don't know if he'll go all crazy either, and you kind of get a feeling that he just might kill somebody at any old time.  He even says as much in this recent episode, words that he may later learn to regret.  Stay tuned.Well, everybody loves serial killers nowadays, from what it seems, at least if you look at the latest television listings.  We have ""The Bates Motel,"" another series that I really like.  We have ""Hannibal,"" which is at least as good, perhaps better.  And then we have ""The Following,"" in my opinion a series that will most likely be cannibalized by both.",Positive
I hope this series is continued.  I love Jonathan Rhys Meyers and he certainly brings his intensity to the role of Dracula!,Positive
"We watched Season 1, 2 and 3 on Amazon Video Stream.  It gave us hours of entertainment.  We loved the characters and stories.  We highly recommend.",Positive
"I was really surprised in watching Season 2, I am looking forward to Season 3",Positive
Starting off good. Just should have a few more encounters with the aliens. The new chief of the alien group shouldn't look so tempting. Probably shouldn't be blonde. Laughing.,Positive
"This is a very cute, very laid back show and my son really enjoys it.  I would recommend it for kids.",Positive
"I've ordered the books now because I find the writing so well done in the series. The relationship between Raylon and Boyd is fascinating, as it is between Raylon and his father and Winona. Can't imagine him as a father, though.",Positive
Now many of you may be thinking the same thing and I don'tblame you at all. The mere mention of the fact has long helda power seldom used for anything. Again thanks.,Positive
I stumbled upon this show and have been watching every since. Great show and hope it remains on the air for a long time.,Positive
"I love this show.  Because I don't have cable nor satellite TV, I am happy to see this in the selection.  One more reason, I have chosen to try Amazon Prime.  Hulu does not offer these selections.",Positive
If you want know about current events in a cogent manner this is the series&#34; go to&#34;series. This series seems to get it right-not some of the time but ALL the time. The content can sometimes be almost TOO powerful to accept and nevertheless I am draw to it.,Positive
"My wife and I love this series, and it even entertains my 3 year old son. We have been watching for some time and enjoy Alton's very educational and corny style of teaching. I don't even cook any of the things he shows us to, but it's just so much fun watching the science behind cooking, that we all love it. I highly recommend any of the seasons of this show.",Positive
"Pure Stephen King.  What more needs to be said.  Stephen King is known for saying that &#34;plot&#34; gets in the way of writing a good story and that is so very evident in Under the Dome.  You never know what is coming next. Who will be the next one to die suddenly and it may well be a good guy character.  The story even feels a developing as life under a dome would be.  There there is the factor of how much is still normal.  We never really know how large this dome is and we suddenly find a lake and an Island. The incongruities just don't matter.  The Dome is so very real who cares where the fresh air comes from or how it rains and how wind blows...its all in and under the dome. Better look out Barbie, you might be next.",Positive
"All of these are good.  The main character is not your standard size 2 glamour tv/movie cop, but she gets the job done.",Positive
Great show with a great plot. Some pretty revolting scenes but overall a great show,Positive
"a 'LifeTime Movie' in spaaaaace.  Boring....and another thing women who are well educated in this competitive field are NOT that superficial and don't have Hally's fake nose, fake boobs, lipo and fake hair...sorry don't appreciate the stupid female stereotypes.",Negative
"Lisa Scottoline is salivating over a human drama and murder, telling what kind of exciting story this made for her book (didn't mention her pocket) for a full hour. Her excitement over a tragedy was unbearable. She maybe could have faked some sadness.This show has boring stories (except the first episode) that goes on forever.",Negative
"I bought this movie only because Norman Reedus is in it. Turns out he plays an unlikeable character that you do not see much.  So- without any &#34;Reedus distraction&#34;, I paid more attention to the movie itself and it isn't bad, which might even mean it's pretty good if you like &#34;love stories&#34; - personally, I don't.  I find it kind of odd that I could feel for the main characters - that's why I gave it four stars. I'll probably watch this again (as I usually do). This story has been done in many ways before so I think the acting was decent even if I didn't care for Reedus' role - which I'm sure is how he meant to play it anyway.  I don't want this review to be a spoiler but I think I should say it's &#34;white-trashy&#34; , as was Out of the Furnace which I liked very much.",Positive
"Pounded through this show, the 30 episodes has some bumps, but all and all is a great ride.  There are some great stories and intertwining of story lines with giving you just enough new information each show to keep you interested.",Positive
I had never watched this show before and was quite surprised and please to see how good it was.  I really like the interaction between the actors and intensiveness of each show.  I plan to watch all the seasons.  Thanks for having this part Prime Video.,Positive
"From the very first episode, we were hooked. Had to have the 1st and the 2nd seasons as soon as they were released!",Positive
The acting is engaging and includes a very talented cast. The writing is excellent in Connelley's Harry Bosch series-based drama. The  pilot leaves the viewer wanting more. This one should make for excellent continued viewing.,Positive
"This show kind of took me by surprise.  Wasn't expecting much, but it does have a great story and characters.",Positive
"What a terrific cast of characters, writing and production. And the music is excellent. C'mon. Hip hop, blues and bluegrass. What's not to love.",Positive
"Maybe it was the dubbing, but the acting is terrible. The plot is about some scientists who are testing a glacial region that has shifted. They come across a portion of glacier that is red as blood. There are denials, suspicions, and predictable &#34;What was that?&#34; &#34;Who's there?&#34;. Well, you know. Mutations are formed from the organism in the glacier, and then there's the blood and gore. I watched this CD at a friend's house, and I'm relieved I didn't waste my money on the CD or in the theater.",Negative
"Is great , if you like Discovery Channel.If you have a TV or BOX compatible with Amazon Instant Video, will be great.Saw in the pc is not the same.But if you are in vacation outside of US , please NO ip detection for IPad and Android. ( this is a message to Amazon )",Positive
Really enjoyed this series. The cast and the stories were great. Will go and find the original Inspector Morse  series so I can see inspector Lewis' early days.,Positive
"This series was exceptional ; extremely well written and acted. It was candid where no one else has been regarding race, human rights for different people and corruption in government . An original,seminal piece of art.",Positive
Always great to be able to watch without commercials. The extras were great except for the episode with Ruah and Christiansen doing a commentary which I was surprised at since they were so highly criticized for the job they did on the S2 DVD. Don't bother listening to their commentary.,Positive
A cute series about a little town in Ireland. It's a British idea of a situation comedy. I liked it.,Positive
"The season is a disappointment so far. There's too much gratuitous violence; the violence has become so predictable it's no long startling. Gemma seems to have retaken center stage with all other women related to the fringes, including Tara, the mother of Jax two (possibly three children). The fact that Tara's imminent trial and possible long term incarceration seem to be less important and of less interest than Gemma's new affair is irritating. And what about Tara's plan? is that riduculius or what? Certainly she must have family or a better choice than her husbands former drug adducted old lady with whom to entrust her children. Like doesn't she have an aunt somewhere??? Since she is among my least favirite characters, except in small doses, constant focus on the wicked occasionally good but always meddling drama queen Gemma is frustrating to say the least.The last episode offered the promise of some improvement but for this diehard fan so far I am disappointed with the present season and long for this wonderful show's past.",Negative
I love the singing and dancing. I couldn't stop watching it. I also got my mom hooked on it. Over all its a masterpiece!,Positive
"This show is great.  They could just be hilarious, but almost every scene they are wearing ties.  I love the counterpoint to their outrageous behavior.  Constantly funny, never remotely predictable.",Positive
"With an actress like Allison Janney, I expected a quality TV program. After following her Mom's (Allison Janney) example, Anna Fans plays a daughter who spent her life drinking and in dead end relationships. Fans is trying to turn her like around and is now sober and attending AA. .Although Fans isn't drinking, little else has changed in her life.. She has an affair with her married boss who is the manager where she works as a waitress - a job she hates. Examples of the pathetic jokes including Fan telling her own daughter she cannot tell her not to smoke pot or drink because that was her quote in her high school year book and calling Janney's date her &#34;new Dad&#34;.",Negative
"i really wanted to like this show, and it is just ok. I think they are trying to hard to make sherlock like a bad@ss hipster guy, and really the main thing i like about the show is Lucy Lu",Negative
"I have not enjoyed this season as much as the previous seasons.  As a a matter of fact, I am extremely disappointed and can't wait until it is over.  Why did they kill Teo?  There is no rhyme or reason to the story.",Negative
I'm a big fan of this show. Since I live in the NW & it take place in the NW. I don't know what else to tell you about the show but that it is a great show.,Positive
I think this show is always fun to watch. The actors obviously like each other and work well together to make this show enjoyable.,Positive
"I love this show more than I can really describe in this review.  The best part is that after marathoning this show, you may just have crazy dreams that are narrated by Morgan Freeman.  I can't really think of a better sales pitch.",Positive
"I got a kick out of it. The cocky astronaut, the 50's space alien setup, and the humour. It isn't on a par with some of the other animation movies out there, but it is nowhere near being really bad. I was somewhat shocked at the people who hated it, but then there is no accounting for tastes. Cute, non-offensive, but still gently skewers the 'you are different from me' mentality. Overall, a solid 4 for animation quality, gentle skewers, and amenability.",Positive
"Amid the current crop of slasherly, hyperviolent horror films, ""The Orphanage,"" from Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona, stands out as an artful, restrained gem of the genre. The movie is driven by plot, personality, fine acting and gorgeous cinematography.  Although many elements are familiar (with wisps of ""The Shining,"" ""The Devil's Backbone,"" and numerous other classics...) the film still feels fresh.  Lead actor Belen Rueda's turn as a mother fighting to get her child back from the grip of supernatural forces is a powerful performance; indeed, everything about this film is well-crafted and intelligently assembled. Worth checking out!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",Positive
"I am glad they brought back this show, season 3, this episode is good. Looking forward to watching the next one..",Positive
Its another one of those series that you get attached to the character but not so much to the plot that you rush to watch the next episode.,Negative
I love this show! I can't wait for more seasons to come. I love how it keeps u on your toes. I just which they were longer.,Positive
"A rather small film altogether.The plot is simple. Some American psychopaths go to some underdeveloped third world countries to be able to realize their phantasms without any limits. Thailand is the target here. And two brothers, under the benediction of their mother, just get the sexual fantasies they develop in their twisted minds materialized in the blood of girls, as young as possible, thirteen, fourteen is good.But these countries start developing some police force to take full control of these psychopaths, except that there is no Miranda there and no lawyer and solicitor does not mean lawyer but pimp. One brother kills a girl and is then locked up with the father of the girl who kills him. Then the cop decides to give a lesson to that father who still has two daughters and cuts his right hand. But the second brother and the mother, who arrives from the USA on an emergency trip, have that father killed whose life had been spared. And then they have to confront the cop himself till the cop stands in front of the second son in a fair fist fights. The brother loses. Then the mother takes over and sends the brother and a hit man to the cop&#8217;s house to kill everyone, including of course his daughter. During that time the cop has killed the mother.Apparently the son spares the daughter, though it is not 100% clear and at the end the cop will gets the hands of that brother, or is it a dream? It is difficult to say at times, because the dialogue is too often music more than words, and ellipses are used in very providential ways to hide the truth.We don&#8217;t know. One thing is sure anyway. These countries are learning how to resist the westerners who dump their social exhaust there for them not to soil western streets. The end is in blood and the cops of these countries do not make the difference between a cockroach and a psychopath. Crush them all and God will forgive those who were innocent.Cruel it is, but necessary indeed for western psychopaths to be taken care of by their own &#8220;rulers&#8221; if their politicians are rulers, which I deeply doubt when we see how lenient they can be with this social trash.To make a potato edible, you cook it.To make social trash palatable you process it.But you avoid caressing and flattering, if not forgiving or using to your own ends.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Positive
Not sure how much I like the show but it has a good dialog that i can fallow,Positive
"Enjoy the new take on storytelling. There are no flashbacks just events in real time. There are no secrets, you learn of big events at the same time the characters do. Makes for very straightforward and honest storytelling",Positive
Loved it on TV but missed some episodes. Was nice to be able to watch the whole thing. Don't know why they didn't keep it going.,Positive
Hard to follow some of the story line. Didn't like most of the characters. Settings for most scenes wasn't very attractive.,Negative
"The battle with the aliens continue.  More introspect into the aliens desires and how the humans resist their efforts to survive.  More intrigue and new characters.The season ender was awesome with a new alien, but its yet to be determined if they are for or against the resistance.",Positive
"It is my favorite.  I hate the thought of watching them all at once, so I have been trying desperately to ration them out, but they are awesome.  Great mixture of comedy, drama, and thriller.  I always want to watch the next episode.  By far my favorite TV  show right now.",Positive
"Original post after first 4 episodes:  Writing is more solid and interesting, great character development too.  They had been stuck in a bit of a rut.Update Dec 7:  Spoke too soon.  The started out well post-Ziva, had interesting plots and did some nice development on the various regulars.  But now apparently they decided they have to copy all the other crime shows that bring in some quirky specialist that solves everything while the rest of the cast stand around and oh yeah, they have to put a female in for the guys.  This does not work, does not fit the NCIS prior seasons where each team member has abilities and they solve things because they work together, and makes me regret I bought a season pass for #11.  I think they wanted to put in a character that can just come up with the answer doing a Sherlock routine so they don't have to figure out a plot line to explain how the team knows what to do. After all, none of the guys (with all their experience etc.) noticed who was bugged and who was NOT bugged and could put the pieces together?  Really?! And why would you be carrying evidence found one place to a stake out in a different location?  Just for Wonder Woman to sort through and miraculously solve the case for you?  I'm dropping my score to 3 stars.  It's not bad if I don't have something else to do for an hour but as it is now it is not a show I rush home from work to catch the latest episode of.  I can find about half a dozen similar shows to watch.  No need to put any extra effort in to catch this one.But it is a great PR job for NSA post all the bad press they have gotten.",Negative
"Hank, Evan, and Divia could not be more different but become a family who are concerned about their patients. You all wish you had a medical team like this. They become a family over the season and it does not feel forced or perfect. The brothers fight, but always have the other's back. I don't write many reviews but have been drawn to this show over the last 5 season. It will make you feel that there is always a good side to life, even when bad things happen to good people. Boris is a great character,and he is stiff, but that does not mean he is not part of the group. The characters that go in and out play vital roles.",Positive
Please don't waste your money and our time. Move on to a better story. This show is horrible and can't get any better.,Negative
Season 6 has been bloody and painful as SAMCRO slides downhill to it's fate.Great performances from from all of the ensemble. It's kind of interesting thatas we see more of Jax's children the story gets darker and bleaker.,Positive
Great series!  I'm always looking forward to the next episode.  Characters are well cast.  People's reactions to various problems/situations that would arise in a town cut off from the rest of society are realistic and exemplify the vast range of human nature. What a marvelous cross-section of people find themselves thrown together in this major dilemma.,Positive
"Anyone who watches the five star earlier seasons must see what the characters who remain get involved in and solve their problems.  The viewer does not blend with the characters in the later seasons as much as the first season but, knowing what is possible with the story line, the viewer keeps looking for the passion and tension experienced in past episodes.",Positive
will please my little grandchildren and me. We love the turtles and have even bought masks to wear while watching.,Positive
Storage Wars Season 2 Scores!I have come to like this show.  We know the characters...and they are just that.  Characters.  They don't play nice sometimes-but that is what this business is all about.  It is fun to find treasures with them.  If you are in the mood for a short and entertaining show-tune in.  It's never boring and you never know what they will find behind the storage doors.  Thanks.,Positive
"Audiences have shown a benign fascination with films involving torture.  Online critics are quick to associate much of this to the SAW franchise - puzzle pictures all centered around a mysterious puppetmaster who puts his players through increasingly gruesome physical ordeals - but methinks it's probably gone on since legitimate splatter films built an audience throughout the 1970's and early 80's.  One things for certain: if you're no cringing or looking away, then you're possibly drawn into the relentless twists that produce harm, fractures, and bloodflow.  And, if that's your thing, you'd do well to pick up a copy of WOULD YOU RATHER.  It may not end up being more than a passing favorite, but you could do worse with 93 minutes, that's for sure.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Iris (played with curious detachment by Brittany Snow) finds herself desperate to make ends meet when she gives up her college career in order to care back home for her terminally ill brother.  Distraught further to learn that she's no match to his needed blood marrow transplant, she responds to a telephone call from his doctor with a great surprise: a millionaire philanthropist named Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs) believes he may be able to offer the young woman an opportunity to see all of her prayers answered.  Lambrick asks Iris to join her at his estate for a dinner, where she and others will be appealing to the Lambrick Foundation.  The catch: only one of those in dire need can and will be helped.WOULD YOU RATHER begins much like it sounds, presenting the ultimate `what if' scenario to dinner guests all hoping for assistance.  They've all been told previously that, after their meal, they'll be taking part in a game to determine which of them will be the lucky winner, and, on that level, the film tries hard to appeal to even the audience's benevolence: clearly, this ""game"" can't be all that it's been made out to be, and these guests find themselves essentially in a sadist's version of `truth or dare' that more likely resembles `dare or dare.'  One by one, they're offered two choices - harm yourself or harm the person on your left (or right) - and, as much as writer Steffen Schlachtenhaufen and director David Guy Levy would have you believe they've crafted a game of wills, it's hardly that.  Simply put, it can't be a true game of wills when a player is forced to choose between two truly bad choices.The story tries to work toward some depth of individual convictions: where it fails is that we're only truly given Iris's background - in fact, we're shown what her life looks like with flashbacks featuring her and her brother - so the other guests at the table never become more than just other guests at the table.  There are hints to some of the obstacles they're possibly facing, but, as the narrative device gives viewers little chance to understand or identify them, they end up being nothing more than hapless victims slowly draining the life from one another.  Sure, there may be some nice ensemble chemistry, but, without any emotional attachment to these other players, it ends up feeling a bit flat.What does work is Combs' palpable menace.  He commands the screen whenever he's there - having followed his career since the 80's, I've always had some respect for his obvious theatricality.  It's nice to see him getting some material that, despite its weaknesses, truly gives him something to do.  As a character, one could argue he's far more interesting than even Ms. Snow (the obvious lead), but, again, a somewhat hackneyed script never produces much hint of substance as to what's made the nefarious Mr. Lambrick into the nefarious Mr. Lambrick.  Villains without motivation work only in thrillers, but they're soon lost to memory once it all fades to black.Lastly, there's a clever little twist brought up in the film's closing sequences.  From what little I've read (in other critiques), it appears to have generated a modest amount of controversy, some claiming it kinda/sorta negates the whole message inherent in what came before it (the twist).  I'd argue that that's far from the case; rather, I see it at instilling yet another lesson to those who ""play"" with life in the way that these fortunate and unfortunate dinner guests did.  It's far too precious to be reduced to a `what if.'  Too bad that's something the screenwriter missed when he conceived of all this.WOULD YOU RATHER (2012) is produced by Periscope Entertainment and Social Construct.  DVD distribution is being handled through MPI Media Group.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds very solid throughout.  As for the special features, there's an audio commentary track featuring the director and writer along with a poster gallery (???) and the theatrical trailer: it's a small collection, but it's there for those inclined to explore the subject matter further.RECOMMENDED.  If I can give you no better reason to see this indie killer/thriller, then it would be to watch the incomparable Jeffrey Combs as the undeniably demented Shepard Lambrick.  WOULD YOU RATHER go back and watch him in RE-ANIMATOR?  Or what of his spectacularly nuanced work as Weyoun the Vorta on STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE?  Or how about his wonderful turn on USA Network's THE 4400?  He's a master of his craft, and, if anything, WOULD YOU RATHER gives him some appropriate scenery to chew as a sadist with a mission: to play a game with the lives of the players truly in the balance.  He's the ultimate `dungeon master' in this contemporary spin on THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME - the ringleader in the most bizarre circus you'll ever see.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group and IFC Films provided me with a DVD copy of WOULD YOU RATHER by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",Negative
Love this sitcom it is as funny as hell! Everybody should own this sitcom! Can't ask for more! Plus it came real quick and came in excellent condition!,Positive
"The quality definitely shows its age and there are no educational value from it other than your kids will learn to call a big lizard to help solve manmade problems.  Story lines are simple and may be boring to kids that like today's computer-animated shows.With that said, it's a safe way to introduce kids to Godzilla.",Negative
I like this not quite sure if I would qualify it as supernatural as much as science fiction but seems to have an unique spin to it but can be confusing who is the bad guy or good guy learn to see things in grey areas,Positive
"I rated this a 5 star for several reasons:  the characters are great in their parts; it offers believable situations; and while serious, there are moments of humor.  Also, nice to watch a show that isn't overkill with violence.",Positive
"With so much hype and talent on board, I was hoping for a much better product.  Spectacular Spider-man was great and way too short...I am still watching them every few months.  Ultimate Spider-man has too many different styles, and too much story jammed in this, to makes it any fun.  Shield, highschool, electric webs?  a spider-cycle...c'mon!  The greatest hero in the world swings around NYC not rides a motorcycle!  Some of the fights have been good, but the quiet story parts are uninteresting.  Marvel please look at Young Justice to see how a good cartoon is made or bring back Spectacular Spider-man.  Spidey deserves a good cartoon....please, please, please....",Negative
With the land before time being an old favorite of mine as a kid I figured I couldn't go wrong getting this for my toddler and baby to watch they love the dinosaurs,Negative
My whole family really loves Daniel Tiger! The show is based off of Mr Rogers Neighborhood. It has catchy little tunes used when teaching the &#34;basis&#34; of the episode and the characters in the show are cute and loveable. Awesome family show.,Positive
Still following the show pretty well.  Still surprised by the character development and story twist that pull me into the show.,Positive
"My husband and I love watching this show.  It's interesting, pretty darn clean and fun to watch, it's hard to find shows like that anymore.",Positive
"I love the show except for the fact that the girls are dancing a bit above their age. There is mama drama, but not as nasty as the other abby show. That makes it a bit more kid friendly.",Positive
"Really took a few shows to grow on me, but now I'm hooked. I've warmed to all the characters and will watch almost anything with Ted Levine in it. Nice change for this kind of series. Feels fresh.",Positive
"Justified is the best show on television right now, according to me. Maybe that's because I live in California, a long way from where I grew up, which is Oklahoma, a state largely settled by people from Kentucky and Tennessee, where the culture is like the culture of those places, pretty much. In short, I like this show because the people on it walk and talk right and the mean ones are largely like the mean ones I grew up with. There are two kinds of Okies, salt of the earth and snake mean, and this show focuses on the latter, but I certainly recognize them. The stories are good, the dialogue is right on, and clever and funny into the bargain, and it's probably the best cast show ever. I love Justified and have from the first show. Read all the books too.",Positive
"I don't know why it is, but the Brits just do a terrific job with mystery series, particularly those involving serial killers.  Ciaran Hinds is just marvelous as strong willed DCI James Langton and Kelly Reilly is equally as interesting as the &#34;new kid on the block&#34; so to speak.  This series has some of the most arresting villains I have ever seen on TV.  If mystery is your cup of tea, do not miss this series.  Thank you Amazon Fire for introducing me to this terrific show!!",Positive
Another wonderful series that I somehow missed when I had a TV.  Now I'm streaming from Netflix and Amazon and have stumbled onto some very well done series.  I'm so glad I have the opportunity to watch them now at my leisure but best of all WITHOUT COMMERCIALS!,Positive
"Meet one of the most interesting love triangles to hit the screen in a while: Danny (Martin Compston), Vic (Eddie Marsan) and Alice (Gemma Arterton). As with all great hostage movies, it's full of drastic power shifts and conflicted loyalties. Sex and love are used as weapons and people gradually grow to see one another as they really are.Watching this movie is like spending a hundred minutes with someone very clever and engaging and a little bit sick in the head.",Positive
"One of the best I have seen, watch both seasons you won't be disappointed. In fact you will be wanting more, hopefully they will have a season 3.",Positive
Best season of the three I have seen to date.  The music was very good and the relationships developed more substance.,Positive
It's an okay show to enjoy the stories of other persons that may have experienced what they have experienced at that time,Negative
"Not sure if the other people who left reviews watched the same movie I watched.This movie is excellent for a B movie.  It kept my interest and was totally unpredictable from start to finish.  From looking at the preview, it was a nice surprise to see the ending.  It is worth the time and money to watch this movie. Samantha Lester is a great actor who I hope makes it to the big leagues soon.Also, I really hope this movie gets enough attention and advertising budget that people actually watch it in the theaters...",Positive
"This show started out great but as the seasons went on it got to be a little too confusing and too much going on, it was finally cancelled but I will admit I was disappointed when it ended",Positive
I am a nanny an the little girl love this show. Every time we go shopping she screams backpack (what she calls Dora) when she see it.,Positive
"I'm a ex-Valley, dotcom guy. With that one caveat, I have to say this show is OMG funny. Best pilot series on Amazon in my opinion, better than Big Bang Theory or the Social Network movie by far.  The jokes about startup life are so 'on', there's a ""yeah, that's what happens!"" laugh every minute. All the actors absolutely nail their roles, especially hoody CEO, nerdy foreign programmer, hard-to-get upscale business girl, highlights-hair office mate, and self-possessed VC. The mid-30s rowdy officemate and his sidekick are also funny - their jokes include various sexual references, fyi. Then, there's also a fast moving and engaging plot with a last-sec happy ending in show #1, a well-chosen background soundtrack, a cameo by an 00's DJ spinner/vegan, a location around an out-of-control shared office space in Mountain View that adds up to ""this show rocks.""",Positive
"these season premieres are often like the first chapter of a book and in this case this book ahould have thirteen chapters this year.Soveriegn is the first chapter of the fifth season of Sons of Anarchy leading in from the last chapter of Season 4. Kurt Sutter and company have, for the last four seasons, brought the story of Clay, Jemma, Jax and the rest of the motley crew of SOA and all their darkenss and have never dissappointed.This season, Sovereign is that first chapter and yes, it did start off with an incredible beginning. I highly reccomend that everyone watch SOA but if you don't know the show, you need to watch the whole show to understand what is going on. SOA is a journey, not a show that starts a story at 9pm and concludes the story at 10pm. It is a tapestry that is woven, every intricate, with it's dark yarn and thread. it is not for the feight of heart.As for this episode, what can I say? Dark, slightly twisted, turns take you into other turns not unlike a motorcyclist traveling at high speed through Southern Califonia canyon, not knowing what is around the next corner. Kim Coates is a standout this season. An often underappreciated actor, he showing he can hang with the best of them as Tig, clay's sargeant at arms. If he doesn't win an emmy for his performance this season, i want to know who does.I highly reccomend, not this episode, but the series for anyone that liked ""the Sopranoes"", for anyone who liked ""The Shield"" or for anyone that thought the first four seasons of ""The Wire"" were the best television ever did or had to offer. But just like the aforementioned tapestry, this show is a set of four books (so far) with thirteen chapters each and going to the middle will leave you lost and confused.Sons of Anarachy, as a show, is right now one of the best shows on TV. Soveriegn, is to me, a kick off for book 5 and closure to chapter 13 book 4. I suggest everyone catch up!",Positive
"Best zombie flic ever!!!  Never been into zombie movies...too corny, usually.  Absolutely hooked!  Never want it to end!  I managed to get everyone i know completely addicted to it.  Even dropped dish network when they temporarily dropped amc.  Willing to pay per episode just so i don't miss a thing.",Positive
"This guy makes this series pop.  Love him, reminds me of my late son, whose name is Milo! Go Team Wolf!",Positive
In this season we leave the world of spys and enter into the world of organized crime.  The characters drive the story and the mystery/discovery again keeps it going.  This season shows how much relationships can effect character development.  How even when a person is on the bottom rung of their character other people can help them climb back to their best.  How much depth can sometimes be hidden beneath a shallow exterior.  The characters are definitely not preachy but many of them have a solid hidden strength.  I really thought they laid the groundwork for season 3 in some of the story line and I wish it had continued.,Positive
"AMERICAN HORROR STORY: ASYLUM (Season Two) takes the series to an even higher level of creepiness than Season One.Be warned, this show is not family viewing fun and those with weak hearts might want to stay away. If horror is your genre, then ASYLUM is not to be missed. The writers take us on a journey into a terrifying Asylum for the Insane run by not so saintly Catholic nuns. Be ready to squirm in your chair as you start this journey.Lovely Jessica Lange returns to AMERICAN HORROR STORY as Sister Jude. She runs BRIARCLIFF MENTAL INSTITUTION with a zeal that could melt steel. She's a troubled woman with a mysterious past and no heart or compassion for the inmates who are often more sane than their keepers. Decades have passed since her days as a screen sex symbol yet her sexiness hasn't faded. Here is one classy American actress not afraid to age gracefully to celebrate the lines in her once smooth porcelain face. It is a joy to see her back in Season Two in an even more diabolical role. Sister Jude the tormentor becomes the tormented. Lange delves into all sides of her role and does a fun fantasy scene where she sings the 60's song THE NAME GAME in her fantasy mind to the inmates. A fun break from the horrors we are all experiencing.Speaking about diabolical, how about a young innocent nun suddenly possessed by the devil? Throw in space aliens terrorizing some inmates and add in a demented doctor who may or may not have been a doctor in a Nazi Concentration camp. How do the writers find such juicy characters to fill the screen?Sister Jude has writer Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson) when she starts poking into the despicable conditions at Briarwood. Kit Walker (Evan Peters) has been sent to the institution for psychological evaluation after being arrested as the serial killer BLOODY FACE. Both are terrorized by Sister Jude and the evil Dr. Arden (James Cromwell). Kit and Lana join forces to escape and expose the evils of Briarwood but evil doctors and nuns and other worldly aliens keep getting in the way.ASYLUM is truly addictive. Each episode brings a new twist and another failed escape. The cast is just perfect in their roles as Season One Alumni Zachary Quinto and Dylan McDermottr return to ASYLUM. This cast was made in heaven. Singer Adam Levine is even in the mix. Lily Rabe is uncanny and mesmerizing as the sweet, innocent nun Sister Mary Eunice possessed by the devilThe episodes are scary and twisted. James Cromwell is the murderous Dr. Arden doing unspeakable experiments on the patients. Naomi Grossman also deserves special note as Pepper, the tragic ""pinhead."" The make-up artists did a remarkable job of turning her into Pepper.One disappointment are the final two episodes where the writers seemed to have felt rushed to wrap up the series with a nice neat bow. No questions remain unanswered and everything is neatly resolved. The fates of all characters are clear and sometimes there is no need to cleanly end a series. The horror aspect is gone in the last two episodes though there is some suspense as the story is neatly finished. The writers seemed to skip a beat towards the end to just finally end the series.This series is so deliciously scary and viewer discretion is advised. The horror factor will unnerve many people but this is one amazing series full of twists and turns and characters are never who they seem to be. Well-written, well-acted and set in the perfect dismal, hopeless setting brings a realism to this show unparalled. If you like horror stories, don't miss ASYLUM.",Positive
I love this series!! Acting is excellent and you will get so connected to the people .I look forward to next season!,Positive
This has been an awesome series so far. I am hoping it endures and more of the story line can be told before it looses popularity.,Positive
"The title is accurate TOO CUTE.  To me there is nothing cuter than a puppy.  This program shows the little puppies lives from total dependence on their mother until they become little rambunctious and playful creatures.  Also, according to their breed, it shows how some will be trained for service and some too become show dogs, etc.  Anyone who watches, couldn't help but want a dog as a pet and a friend.  I have had five in my lifetime.  A puppy is not only an asset in a child's life but an adult also.  I highly recommend that you watch this program.",Positive
The bit of extra time per episode made this season just that much more exceptional! Again the costuming and set decoration was amazing!,Positive
"Defying Gravity is an awesome show that mixes the foreseeable future with an alien sci-fi twist.  It's all about mystery with flashbacks to see where the characters have come from and how far they have gone.  The whole show left me on the edge of my seat and I have since re-watched the show many times over.  Its great to watch at the end of a day.  Anyway, if you're a space fan and love mystery, this is the show for you.  This show was sadly cancelled before its time.  Have no fear in buying this gem.",Positive
"The Pact is a slow horror film that mixes tension with jump-out scares. I don't want to spoil the scares, but I will say the movie has similar scares to the frights found in Insidious and kind of like Paranormal Activity (this is not a handheld camera film, by the way). Some of the scares were expected, but still managed to creep me out a bit. In the right environment, it should deliver some spine-tingling frights.  I have mixed feelings about the ending though, it's original but moves away from what the the first two acts built. Some may dislike the slow pace, but I felt it worked well. Acting was fine most of the time, and the music was great.For your information, the film has some blood and gore, terror, and partial nudity (nothing serious or over the top), in case you were planning to watch it with anyone under 17 (it's Not Rated, but it's pretty tamed). Worth 9.99? Maybe for fans of this type of horror, but you should wait for a drop if you're barely interested. I enjoyed it, though.",Positive
This is a great season!  I am half way through it at this point.  The characters have changed a lot since season one and you absolutely must start at the beginning.  I wouldn't be surprised if you find yourself feeling differently about a lot of characters after watching season 5.,Positive
"I think this show is OK. But I felt like it lacked the strong humor and cast of a show like 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia'. I also thought the main characters looked too much alike, which created an odd contrast from the diversity of the children in the school. While I found the show amusing, it's nothing special, I wouldn't go out of my way to watch an episode. I got the sense the writers were trying way too hard to be funny here.",Negative
"Love the show and the characters. Even Juliette who I found so annoying at the beginning really has grown on me by this season. I am glad this show is still going and I hope it continues to. The characters are likable, and interesting for the most part. I guess I would have to say that the royals storyline is less interesting to me than the day to day of the main characters but it isn't overbearing, it isn't taking over the show. I do find myself not really paying attention when they are in that part of the show.I realize that the wesen are the reason for the show but it is starting to look like the only crimes that are ever committed are by wesen now and not human :). This isn't a major flaw, but I find it amusing that the crime gets committed and then in the investigation they figure out that it is wesen EVERYTIME. It wouldn't be interesting if it sometimes wasn't wesen, but just something I noticed. I am not sure there is a way around it. Unless you turned them into the detectives that are brought in on &#34;unexplained&#34; or unusual crimes.. but thats been done so many times too.All in all, this is a really entertaining show. Not too overly serious or scary, but also not too cheesy in my opinion. It strikes a good balance. It isn't silly although sometimes the effects are not perfect. This is fine, we know it isn't real and it helps it not turn into a horror show. Just good fun.",Positive
"Titus Welliver gives a strong performance as Bosch and parallel plotlines give an interesting twist to a tired genre.  Some glaring errors in fact (having cougar plaintiff's lawyer approach and banter with defendant without his lawyer present would get her disbarred).  Enjoyed seeing cast that look like real people (plaintiff lawyer excepted).  Writing needs a little tightening as having a lawyer violate ethical rules for dramatic effect is jarring and should be avoided.  Otherwise, the show is really worth watching for a full season.",Negative
Love the interaction between characters--didn't like when they were acting apart.  The Harvard cover-up is getting a bit old--Mike needs to get legit!  Gabriel needs a true love interest.,Positive
"Good show, lead actor reallyMakes the role of Ragnar his own, for the weak of heart, caution when watching the episode&#34; blood eagle&#34; if u want to know why Google it lol!",Positive
"Last season was kind of disappointing, but this episode brought it back to its roots!  Good to see it back!",Positive
"One of the best seasons, with compelling story lines and twists that will make you gasp. Not to be missed!!",Positive
I reviewed Season 1 -- and the good keeps going with Season 2 !,Positive
I have enjoyed this show very much and I hope to see more episodes In 2014/2015 Mr. Foyle is a detective,Positive
"There is NO way a professional football cheerleader who ends up marrying a team owner would call football uniforms, &#34;costumes.&#34;That's when I knew these writers were trying to insult human intelligence.It sunk when they portrayed the football players, most of them black, snorting coke (at a black team player's house / party) and letting loose a rented monkey who ends up snorting coke and shooting a Latino place kicker in the foot.  Guys (football player actors) where's your ethnic dignity?  Don't do this to yourself and your people.Yuck.  The show was beautifully shot but the story and the stereotypes sunk to low levels.",Negative
The story between the two lead actors are amazing and I enjoy so much thank for keeping me interested in the show every week.,Positive
Maybe they should get all new housewives in O County.  I did watch the full season plus the reunion show but it was kind of yawny. It was a little to &#34;mean girls&#34; for me this year.  The folks that are not coming back should stay and some of the ones returning should leave.,Negative
A very new and good &#34;gimmick&#34; for a story.  It is hard to imagine how the series can keep up the same interesting slant.  However I am willing and eager to continue watching.  Tim Roth is one of the best actors around.,Positive
"My wife and I enjoy almost every paranormal show on TV.  This one takes the premise seriously and, outside of some of the choices the &#34;hunters&#34; make, we found it fairly believable.  I won't list shows here we don't appreciate but this one we do...",Negative
Any movie starring Cumberbatch is going to be good. He is a superb actor and I especially enjoy the British/European setting. I look forward to further viewing.,Positive
"always interesting to watch, especially if you watch from beginning to end. you got to love sipowitz the main character.",Positive
"SOA has been a great show but as the plot deepens it also is losing its charm.  To like a show you have to care what happens and the writers have kept me hanging to long on many plot lines, and there is only so much of going from bad to worse that I can take before I grow numb and stop caring.  They reached it in season 6.  Greater violence and more gruesome events don't bring me back to the first 4 seasons where I had some hope that while things would go bad they would not continually degrade from bad to hopeless as they have now taken us.  In 6 seasons could 1 thing go right?  Since Jax got Abel back everything the SOA touches  blows back directly in their face.  Repetition is repetition no matter the context.",Negative
Mads Mickleson is incredible and really captures the famous character. Supporting cast has fantastic chemistry. The show is one of the few currently on tv that really capture psycological terror.,Positive
My daughter and I watch this religiously!  Itsa great to watch how creative some of these chefs are! Well done!,Positive
"The 1980 original is a classic and it still gives me chills when I see it.. Joe Spinell gave the character so much dimension and creepy insane authenticity. This new version is not only bad, it's boring and hard to believe Elijah's character being able to slash a piece of paper, let alone have the strength murder anyone.. He's as scary as a stack of pancakes... I mean, really, someone as weak and scrawny as Woods is going to murder a screaming woman in the middle of a parking lot, in the middle of a city with all those tall buildings around, and you're going to tell me NO ONE is going to see it?? Please... So all of this hype surrounding this remake and it just amounts to yet another clich&eacute; slasher mess trying to pretend to be a remake or indie art, when in fact, it could never stand on it's own two feet.. without Woods or the audacity to try and consider itself a remake... But to be fair, the first 3 minutes were good, but from then on, horrible..",Negative
The acting the writing the concept.....it has great replayability as well for viewing a second time. It's like silance of the lambs/six feet under/CSI all rolled into one quality show.,Positive
"Thylacinus cynocephalus aka Tasmanian tiger went extinct in Aussie land, Tasmania and NZ in the early 1900s and despite rewards of millions up until quite recently, there have been only a few unconfirmed sightings.This movie is taken from a novel by the same name. Unfortunately, the characterizations seemed like someone decided to toss a bunch of popular stereotypes into a bag, give it a good toss, and see what story comes out of it.The stereotypic loner assassin with high tech sniper rifle is hired by the usual big bucks pharmaceutical company to kill off the last Thylacinus but not before getting blood and tissue samples so said company can be the sole maker of a resulting super drug. Not believable.Stereotype of ""greenies"" protecting old growth forests against the loggers. Pointless subplot.Stereotype of townspeople in bar showing in your face distrust of a foreigner, in this case the assassin. Not believable.One of the townspeople happens, coincidentally, to have a similar sniper rifle and tries to kill the assassin. Also not believable.Assassin lodges in the home of a researcher, who has gone missing for months. Home is occupied by a depressed wife who can't get out of bed for months while her two very young children take care of everything. Not believable and another plot digression.Sam Neill plays a part time guide along with other roles in the movie that just seemed contrived. Pointless subplot.No flow to the storyline, just a bunch of cutout stereotypes. The only acting worth noting was by Morgana Davies whose naturalness made her character believable. Similar to her performance in ""The Tree"". So far she's hasn't been influenced by the ""Rubber Stamp Acting School"" or become a perennial stuck-in-a-rut actor.",Negative
This show is one of my favorites also.  I purchase them so I can watch when i am able to.,Positive
loved the show.  music was great  sorry there is not more of the series.  looking for another show that is similar.,Positive
I really Enjoyed the series. I hated that some of the characters went away but the new ones were good too,Positive

Sure, he can pull YOUR bacon out of the fire, but HIS house will burn down in the process.That being said, it make me love Jack and root for him all the more.

"My bias...Loves: Gangster moviesLikes: Gratuitous violenceDislikes: Long moviesHates: Homemade dentistryI've been looking forward to Beat Takeshi's 'Outrage' for months. I saw the trailer last fall and was instantly excited, and was even more excited this week when I saw that it popped up on Netflix available for streaming. Needless to say, I watched it the first chance I got.The long and short of this flick - Beat plays a guy who runs a crew that takes care of the Yakuza's dirty work. Obviously, there's some things that can go awry with a profession like this and things get hairy. What evolves is a double crossing, lying, cheating, murderous tale that involves too many players to keep track of. Fingers get lopped off, bullets fly, and blood spills.You'll have to pay attention to get the most out of this movie, but stick with it. It's a brisk movie, at 109 minutes - just to my tastes - but there's a lot going on. The violence is brutal - there were two parts that made me want to look away.This isn't Beat's best, but it's absolutely worth a watch.Score: 4/5 Stars",Positive
It is easy to see by the ratings how popular this show is but my wife and I are fairly picky about what we watch and this show is one of our favorites. We love the characters and the way they interact most of all. The stories are mostly great and PG rated so the whole family can watch.,Positive
"I truly enjoyed this show. Honestly speaking, I finished Season 1 and 2 within a few days after I started to watch. For a few mornings, my wife asked me why my eyes were red!",Positive
Entertaining show as you watch them look for items to resell.  Humorous banter between the two guys and their office manager.,Positive
"Love the show. Not easy to keep my attention at all, this does it all threw season one. Not much else out today has really got my attention other then grim. All the other shows just lack in the way they are built up. I didn't find this to be lacking at all.",Positive

"It's stuck inside a giant bong that turns Mr. Ordinary into ""The Mask"", which then blows people up, but prevents him from buttoning his shirt. There is a never-ending pool party... for those who like that sort of thing... as well as never-ending joy rides between ""buddies"" who make it no secret that they hate each other. Are you ready for some laser blasting? I know a mutant turtle who is!",Positive
I've watched this movie many times and have never gotten tired of seeing it. It's intellectually engrossing due to the plot twists and the interesting legal issues that come up in the film. It's also just fun to watch because of the action and suspense. It's also educational because it exposes us to the fact that what happens in the film probably happens in real life all the time without our knowledge. It makes us look at the problems of pollution and gov't policy in regards to pollution in a new light. Julia Roberts and Denzel Washington are great in this movie!,Positive
Who doesn't like Rupert Penry-Jones....  episodes move a little slow- but still worth watching and still better than most of what we get on our Prime Time channels..,Positive
"While I really enjoyed both seasons of ""The Killing,"" I believe the audio production is second rate as far as getting to the bottom of capturing Holder's nearly incomprehensible mumblings are concerned. I'm not hard of hearing and he is not nuanced--he just mumbles. It really distorts plot points in a series that has so many convoluted plot points already. I don't understand the production oversight here. All the other characters are pretty easy to understand, but Holder--a truly great character conceit-- is simply an annoyance. That said, I was impressed that they could stretch this story into two years, but there are some things that are just too contrived. But we live in a world of contrivances, so what do i know?",Positive
"Not so good. A bunch of &#34;smarmy, look at me&#34; crooks and murderers that want to get a little bit more noteriety by bragging about their despicable deeds. Would not recommend.",Negative

"The Giant Mechanical Man is a good and pleasant movie without quite crossing the line into great cinema. It does, indeed, have a few of the cliche`s of romantic comedies but is not predictable. Good acting and direction bring an interesting script to the screen. It's warm and at times funny without many belly laughs. I didn't quite love it, but a sure liked it, really liked it, a whole lot.",Positive
"Hello,  This show is great.  It is different from the norm.  The characters are great and the story telling is very good.  I think you will enjoy it.  Thanks.  Just my opinion.",Positive
"I believe this will be a big hit. I can't wait to see more of this drama and explore the eccentricities of the main character. I think the cast was chosen well for this production. This detective is a driven and bent on making sure that the case is solved no matter whose toes he steps on and all the while he is on trial himself for a supposedly &#34;bad&#34; shooting of a serial rapist. This show is based on the books by Micael Connelly and if you are a fan you want to watch this series. I give credit to Titus Welliver, who plays the detective, for making his character believable. It is well worth watching.",Negative
"This was a very well done series (now I'll have to watch them all).  Interesting story line, good acting and enough action to keep you interested but not so much that it overtook the story.",Positive
"The acting is excellent. The story is gripping. It's well shot. The soundtrack is fitting and great. The character development is intelligent, consistent, and believable. Each episode makes you want to watch the next episode. Even my wife, who initially did not want to watch this show, has gotten into it. She thought it was just white trash crap. She thought it was just manly stuff for her husband to watch. But then, after much coaxing, she gave it a chance. Now she's more engaged than I am! And I'm the Harley rider!I will make one note of caution: this show is probably not for young children (you decide what age that means - you know your kids better than I do). It's violent and explicit. There are things I would not want my 8 year old to see. I don't care about the sex stuff, but the violent images can be disturbing, even for an adult.",Positive
"I never read anything Linda Lovelace wrote because it's impossible to discern how much was true.  Who would buy her books if they were typical bland stories of &#34;I rejected my parents, married a hoodlum, and started hooking to support my drug habit?&#34; To be fair, the film gives the surface events, then starts over with her later claims of unpleasant things going on behind the scenes.  I have no doubt men this violent existed.  I'm just not totally convinced her husband was one of them.  At least she found a few years of relative happiness before the fatal car accident.",Negative
the show takes forever to get anywhere and when something in the plot actually happens it is not that great,Negative
Love this show! ! By far one of my favorites of the fall season.  Vastly different than other police procedural type shows mainly because of the personal relationships - and they have grown so much this season.  I can't wait for more episodes.  Only sad point is the looming holiday season means that schedules will get all discombubelated and make me angry I can't have my shows when they are supposed to be there.,Positive
"From the moment that this movie begins, it is interesting. The characters, setting and plot are exciting, believable and moving. I want to see more.",Positive
"In high school biology, I remember photosynthesis being taught.  This, moreover, says that plants need three ingredients to grow well: nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium.  It explains why that is and then practically says man must explore land, air, and water to obtain it.Like a lot of ""Modern Marvels"" episodes, this shows the inner workings of factories.  There's a commercial of Honey Bunches of O's that works in the same.  Remember the ""Simpsons"" episode in which Bart and his classmates go to a box factory?  Well, a lot of episodes in this series are like that.  However, so much of this episode deals with fecal matter that it's funny seeing so many men put their hands in compost that I practically want to yell out, ""Do you know where that's been!?""The program doesn't start mentioning doodoo until about 15 minutes in.  However, the narrator stated that some South American countries fought a war to get access to bird droppings.  The narrator stated, ""Straight from the bat's behind and into the can.""  He also said, ""One more hard push and it's out!""  They seem somewhat conscious of the humor of the subject.For years, I've asked people online, ""Is there something that can be done with human doodoo?  I mean, we make so much of it.  Can it be helpful somehow?""  I love this episode as it partially answers that question.  However, the only use they assign to it is for golf courses.  What about keeping the Sahara from growing?  What about helping islands to stay around despite global warming?  There is an environmental documentary from PBS that said chicken doodoo is what's ruining all the water in the Chesapeake.  This program suggests that worms, cows, bats, and birds make useful doodoo, but the show ignores the doodoo that's bad for the world.So many environmental documentaries are about doom and gloom.  They make you want to close the curtains and hide, rather than fight to save the planet.  Well, this episode suggests that the stinky brown stuff may be the globe's ray of light in many ways.",Positive
"Loved this show when it was on. Missed a lot of it at the end of reg. season when we went away on a long vacation so I was thrilled to be able to watch it. Loved the interaction of the characters, the threads of all the little side stories and especially loved the character Jake. A good mystery as well as you try to figure everything out, who is Hawkins & exactly what is he up to? Who are the good guys & bad guys?",Positive
"Another very good episode of a show that always seems to be struggling. Cheers to NBC for sticking with this show.Because every sseason seems like the last, everything was tied up at the end of last season. Now that the show is back, there does seem to be some repetitiveness among the various characters.But the writing and acting on this show is heads and shoulders above most of the other offerings on your tv.",Positive
"Ok, so they're lampooning the Republican Party and that's an easy target these days, but they have so much fun doing it. In the process, they make a good point that &#34;conservative&#34; has changed meaning and position in the last 10 years. Bring back the traditional conservative! In case nobody realizes it, &#34;radical conservative&#34; should be an oxymoron.",Positive
It's about time we had a television show that really tells it like it is.  It is great entertainment and I could not stop watching it once I started watching.,Positive

"I chose a 5 rating because it was action packed with a Science Fiction Plot, the character Walter Bishop makes the Show exciting, you never know what Walter will do, the people called the &#34;Observers&#34; are people that can travel through time, and read minds, it is an exciting Science fiction show that is not to far fetched as compared to Science fantasy. The show also raises issues about ethics and human belief.",Positive
This is a great show you can watch with your kids. Not loud and silly like a lot of other kid's shows. Very real and brought back lots of memories of my own childhood.,Positive

"Zero stars if I could. Actually, NEGATIVE FIVE stars if I could.Wow. I can't believe how bad this film was. It actually became excruciating about halfway through. I had to force myself to keep watching it, so that I could write a review. This film should be taken down immediately, and all copies, draft materials, and anything else related to it should be destroyed. It cannot be salvaged. You'd be better off starting from scratch, than trying to save this film. This is one of the most detestable, deplorable, despicable movies I have ever seen that has tried to tout itself as a ""family film"". Good grief it was bad. How bad was it? The most morally admirable character was the VILLAIN, ""The Flamingo"", and he's obviously not that morally upright. I would say that this film was written by a disbarred lawyer, but even disbarred lawyers are familiar with the basics of ethics and morality. The writers of this film seem to have no understanding, nor familiarity with ethics.Perhaps the greatest reason that superheroes are a classical storytelling device is the fact that they offer the opportunity to draw clear delineations between what is right, and what is wrong. Superheroes often face moral dilemmas, but what makes them superheroes is the fact that they make the right choices, no matter how hard it is to do what's right. Otherwise, they're superVILLAINS. Superpowers, super abilities, and super tech do not make superheroes. CHOICES make superheroes.Now let's examine the choices that this ""superhero"" family makes.Although the father recognizes that he needs to ""protect his family from a murderous mainframe"", when faced with the financial repercussions of possibly losing his house, he caves stating ""fine, just don't blow up my house"". So, finances trump family? Got it.Furthermore, the father loses any reluctance about the arrangement with the ""murderous mainframe"" once it becomes obvious to him that he can use the Grim Avenger tech to make his personal life better by using it for chores.After seriously scorching his neighbor's house using a laser to trim hedges, rather than try to repair the damage, or make reparations, or even confess to it, he runs and hides like the deadbeats who hit someone's parked car in the parking lot and leave without taking responsibility.The wife agrees to go to (in her own words) ""a dinner date"" at one of the most expensive restaurants in town alone with her gorgeous playboy coworker. All of the professional, married women that I know don't eat meals with nor travel with male coworkers alone, but only in a group.When it becomes apparent to the father that ""The Flamingo"" is rampaging across the city in order to force a showdown, the father chooses to address largely invented family emergencies instead, at the cost to countless other families.To spy on his wife on her dinner date with Richard, the father implants a Grim Global Positioning Tracker in Richard, even though he's at first horrified by the danger of implanting it in someone's spinal cord (but, hey, it's okay if you don't like the guy, right?) because he's ""protecting his family"". Evidently, trust for your spouse isn't requisite in protecting your family. (And later he ironically berates the computer for invading his daughter's privacy by checking Facebook.)The father, rather than allow Richard to drive away with his wife, destroys Richard's Corvette.The son, upon acquiring one of Grim Avenger's power gauntlets, and after destroying a neighbor's treehouse, rather than make reparations, or a confession, cuts and runs (perhaps taking a cue from his father's lack of moral compass).The son uses the power gauntlet to bully a bully (becoming the evil that he had resented and detested).The father constantly shirks his end of the bargain, doing everything that he can to avoid training and crime fighting.The father uses the ""Hypno Spray"" to brainwash the most popular boy at his daughter's school in order to completely reform him and force him to be his daughter's boyfriend, then congratulates himself with ""THAT's how to parent!""The father uses the x-ray goggles to cheat at the scratch-off lottery, by finding winning tickets.The son and daughter abandon her tasered, unconscious boyfriend on their porch, because they're busy fighting over who gets the power gauntlet.The father uses the Grim Avenger super car just to get to his wife's dinner in the city, then uses the Grim Avenger persona to save her presentation by offering the persona for marketing purposes. (Then berates his children for using the super car to cheat ""whenever things get hard"", but never realizes how hypocritical that is.)The father allows his children to use the super car to get to school, so that he can continue to do marketing as the Grim Avenger for his wife. (Then is surprised when they abuse it to skip school and become more popular.) This also potentially endangers his family by exposing his secret identity, but the show never addresses this. It also eventually leads to ""The Flamingo"" gaining control of the super car, but fortunately for the city all he cares about is revenge, otherwise the city would have been screwed, no thanks to our ""heroes"".The daughter uses the automated super car to cheat and pass her driver's exam.The son speculates about selling Grim Avenger tech on eBay for money.The son uses tattling about his sister's using the super car to pick up friends so that he can get out of trouble for skipping school.The father puts his children in danger by pursing criminals with them just to show them how important of a responsibility it is (even though it's the first time that he's bothered to do any crime fighting).In answering his last chance questions, the father makes it clear in his answers that his family comes first, no matter the cost to society and the city. The movie deems that to be a virtue. What happens to the superhero (or superspy) families that were willing to put their families on the line for others? That viewed the well-being of society as higher than their own well-being? Since when is selfishness a virtue? Disregard for others? Unwillingness to sacrifice?The family abandons a helpless, tied-up Richard in the same warehouse that had previously exploded and killed the prior Grim Avenger.The movie tries to have a huge moment at the end in the final fight where the father ""realizes"" a bunch of things like ""heroes don't need masks"", but he doesn't actually realize anything meaningful. He comes off as a groundlessly cocky jerk, not someone who has been on a revelatory journey. It's trite, with all of the moral goodness of twinkies.The movie ends with the family continuing to try to find ways to pimp out the Grim Avenger persona for marketing money. (Then the father laughably asserts at the end of the film that ""This city needs us"" even though the opposite has been shown throughout the entire film.)So how's ""The Flamingo"" the most morally upright? He goes out of his way to make sure that his actions don't cause physical harm, almost to a laughable degree. On the other hand, the ""superhero"" family runs him over with a car, uses the ""Hypno Spray"" on him to brainwash him so that he can become their personal lawn care help rather than turning him in to authorities, and when the ""Hypno Spray"" wears off, they have a deadly robot ready to threaten him with physical harm if he doesn't trim their hedges. Nice. I'm so glad that a family with such a high regard for human life, and no propensity for abusing power has been granted so much power. (Please note the sarcasm. Please?)Much of this would have been fine if there had been morals to any of these experiences where the family learned that what they had done was wrong, and that there are more important things in life than themselves. This isn't the case at all. It's the opposite. Everything works out despite them not learning any lessons, and merely reinforces that they can cavalierly do whatever they want at the expense of any others. Most of the immoral and unethical things that this family does end up having ZERO negative consequences for the family (although, the same cannot be said for the innocent public who is saddled with this supervillain family).The problem with this film concept is that the family is detestable. The computer is right: they don't deserve access to the Grim Avenger's tech. They abuse it, and constantly put others in danger as a result. Their most dominant trait is family selfishness (they aren't necessarily selfish individually, but their family as a group acts selfishly towards the rest of the world). They act as if their family and the happiness of the family justify any other type of action, no matter the repercussions for the rest of the world. If this family has to choose between either doing the right thing OR being happy, this family inevitably chooses to be selfishly happy. This family is closer to a family of supervillains, then a family of superheroes. Like supervillains, they use their powers for family gain rather than for the betterment of society.This show is detestable for its lack of ethics, and tone deafness, and is likely unsalvageable. Relegate the whole concept to the trash heap, or be honest, and make a show glamorizing a supervillain family.",Negative
"Joss Whedon has done a lot of terrific TV projects and I continuously wish him a lot of work and success. This is not one of those unfortunately, and I suggest it will probably not make it to a second season, and definitely not past 2 seasons.The fatal flaw is the casting. The lead actor Clark Gregg who plays Poulson just doesn't have enough charisma to anchor a show. Additionally, he can't pull off the Whedon voice. The sarcasm and irony are awkward on him.  The second fatal casting flaw can be summed up in three words that are synonymous with untalented actor: Ming. Na. Wen.  Ming Na-Wen is a so thoroughly untalented actor that she could not even convincingly portray an over-the-hill Chinese actress.  Maybe, and I stress MAYBE, she could convincingly portray a dead body, but likely only with the help of a heavy sedative.",Negative
"Although you still have the drama between the moms the competition was alone was very good and each judge was fair.  I didn't think the little one should have gotten as far as she did due to her youth and lack of concentration. She should have gone home earlier since she has time to grow and develop and try again.  Overall, it was fun to watch and if you just want a laugh and to see what NOT to do to your child, then watch this.",Positive
Its a good show that is entertaining.I think the writing is missing a few key scenarios and plot twists in each episode.,Positive
This is our new favorite TV show. Lots of interesting characters and interesting story lines. Hats off to the FX network for this gem!!,Positive

"When my sister-in-law and daughter, both in the health care field, highly recommended this series, I was interested. My husband and I had previously enjoyed viewing other historical series including Call the Midwife, Dutchess of Duke Street, and Foyle's War, becoming disappointed when we reached the final episodes. We had been looking for an additional good series, and this fits the bill quite well - interesting story lines, good characters, factual basis - who could ask for more?",Positive

"For the final season of ""Chuck"", producers Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak faced a daunting dramatic challenge: how to generate new drama, comedy and romance for a great show.  After all, at the end of season four, nice guy CIA agent Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levy) finally married his lovely CIA partner Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), after protecting the birth of niece Clara to sister Ellie and brother-in-law Captain Awesome.  Operation Bartkowski was officially ended, leaving Chuck, Sara, gruff NSA agent John Casey (Adam Baldwin), and Chuck's best friend Morgan (Joshua Gomez) without a mission.  The solution: reshuffle the deck.Using money from Alexei Volkov, last season's leading villain, Chuck, Sara, Casey, and Morgan go into the private spy business, only to discover the competition can be quite fierce.  Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix) has a recurring role as the cutthroat leader of a rival firm, and as someone with a history, and maybe a future, with Casey.  Morgan, who ended up last season with the Intersect in his head, discovers the hard way the challenges of having super spy skills, and in the process damages his relationship with Casey's daughter Alex.  Chuck, reduced to basic nice guy computer nerd, goes through his own period of painful adjustment, before having to face his greatest opponent one more time.  Sara Walker's long-missing mother will make an appearance at a vital moment, while fans will be treated to additional fun with the BuyMore gang, and to additional Bartkowski family comedy (and drama over Chuck and Sara's future).Team Bartkowski will face a series of threats from rogue CIA agents, including one who sets up the team for the crime of the century, leaving the team with a choice of jail or life on the run.  In a tense multi-episode conclusion, Chuck and Sara will battle one last ruthless opponent for control of the Intersect and everything they have built together.  The suspense will be good to the last drop.""Chuck: The Complete Fifth Season"" has the last 13 episodes of the show and is highly recommended to its dedicated fans.  The DVD set includes the usual blooper reel, deleted scenes, and a few farewell features.",Positive
"While with the introduction of Sam Carter from Sg1 helps boost the fanbase and ratings for the series overall the series has reached a decent peak in its entertainment and sci-fi value for many sci-fan fans of this series and others.  While it came as no surprise it did feel a little unneeded to make a formal couple out Shepard and Teyla but oh well, also it's nice to see that the writers have allowed the side characters to have their own romantic relationships in the series too.  While we still have the Wraith and Replicators in the series they haven't seemed as much the viable threat they were made out to be in the previous seasons or series though they still are a threat.  The season shows the strong point of the series until the final season which sadly concludes this growing but sadly stumped series.",Positive
Love the show; Hate some of the content.  I'd give the show at least four stars if it wasn't for G** D*** said in several of the later episodes and Toby having a lesbian kiss in episode 7 &#34;Babes in the Woods&#34;.  The language and sexuality were unnecessary to the story and were gratuitous to the plotline.,Negative
We LOVE Raising Hope!!  After the first season...  a real &#34;knee slapper&#34;....  I was wondering how they would continue to come up w/such entertaining story lines...  as in the beginning &#34;Hope&#34; is just an infant....  Somehow they've done it!... We never miss an episode.,Positive
The connection between the two main characters is outstandingly entertaining. Well written and delivered. This show makes me want to be an attorney.,Positive
I hope Amazon picks up this show...  It is intense and every character seems to offer a great intriguing story .. Was the doctor really just finding out about the bones?.... What past is that female officer running from?.... Bosch seems to be perhaps the only 'normal' character in the story.... but everyone around him promises to unravel a world of drama.... H'm let's see more!!!,Positive
"My wife and I had never heard of this series, but found it on Amazon Prime.  The male lead is recognizable from the hit cable series &#34;Homeland.&#34;  Yes, it's another cop detective drama and there's always a murder to solve.  But there are enough other quirky plot twists and the murders also have twists.  You find out right away that the male lead detective was himself framed and spent 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit.  So these various parallel plots and plot twists keep it very interesting. The acting is good and there is also an element of humor.  So all in all, it is a very entertaining series that makes you want to keep watching it.",Positive
"Other than some overtly sexual content, this is a great show to share with your teenager.  Who hasn't felt completely awkward at this age?  We had some interesting discussions.",Positive

"I'm only 3 minutes in and I paused the episode to write this review, if the pilot was only the first sequence before the opening credits and the opening credits I would be sold. It's the best mash-up of Always Sunny and Workaholics in a Strangers with Candy-esque school that I never knew I wanted until now. If this doesn't make the cut I will lose all hope for this original programming idea from amazon.",Positive
"This film is slow but it is meant to be because it is an elegy to the loss of the senses, one by one.  Two beautiful people fall in love when this begins worldwide,  The order of loss is smell, taste, hearing, vision.  The beautiful thing this film does is that as each sense is loss there is a renewed but brief celebration of the sense or senses left. The world is also ending.  There is no reason discernible for any of this,This is one of many end of the world films or books which have come forth in the some number in the last few years,  There seems to be almost no interest in depicting us being overtaken by aliens and sent to oblivion by them. No, this is the end of our world on earth as given by each writer's take on now it will occur,  Although the woman is a doctor working in illness outbreak, she is unable to prove that this is any dissease.Another clever aspect is that each loss is preceded by some wild emotional outburst.  The smell one is preceded by fits of sobbing.  The hearing one starts with a fit of rage.  I found it fascinating that an avalanche of emotion heralded each loss.This film grows on you,  The first twenty minutes passes very, very slowly but if you stick with it, you will find yourself pulled into it.As an added benefit, Ewan McGregor and Eva Green in the lead roles, have to be two of the most gorgeous people on the planet.  Louis CK recently did a comedy act where he said that he'd been a heterosexual all of his forty plus years.  However, he recently met Ewan MacGregor and found himself just mesmerized by how beautiful he was.  Finally he concluded that even he could turn gay briefly if it meant he could have Ewan!I think the movie is great if you can hang in there through the very slow start.",Positive

"The touch of Elmore Leonard is evident in the characterization and plot development of this series.  We love and hate almost everyone from one minute to the next.  There is no limit to the evil potential and the possibilities for disaster and betrayal.  Violence is a premise, but this is the wild West in Kentucky.  Interesting, engrossing, sometimes charming, sometimes revolting.  Keep watching!",Positive

Glad it has lasted this long! Easy family viewing for the younger guys. Not for little ones but your older elementary and middle schoolers. In the vein if &#34;The Librarian&#34;. We have really enjoyed it.,Positive
The premise of this series is very touching and it carries well into the episodes. The acceptance of all &#34;body types&#34; and the valuing of individual gifts is very refreshing.,Positive
"Well, as some reviews has already stated this is a show that isn't exactly uplifting, filled with unapologetic flawed characters and a few social/moral problems we face in today's society however it is entertaining as hell!The story explores the life long hardships of single moms but it's filled with sarcasm that it might be seen as offensive to some, especially those who can relate to it in real life. At first, it seems that the writers tangle a lot of contemporary issues ex; financial problems, alcoholism, promiscuity etc.. that a viewer cannot resist the urge to exclaim in protest. However, if you keep watching you'll grow to love the show and understand it's humour.Me personally, I loved how the writers made this show and the way it is presented. It is a social satire about very controversial sometimes depressing realities but it always tends to find a bright spot to everything. The characters are loveable Christie is good at her role but Bonnie is great! It's wonderful to find a strong female character who doesn't feel the need to whine and complain about her  being victimised every five seconds! Finally someone who owns up for their past. We need more people like those nowadays.But even if some situations like most sitcoms are overly exaggerated for the sake of ratings and what not. Mom is a show made with heart. I would love to recommend anyone to give it a shot, it's worth a try.",Positive
"I really liked this one and I love this sort of humor.Not as slick as Betas, another on of Amazon's original Pilots, but a solid four star effort that I'd love to watch more of. I really liked the pilot, but I can imagine that this is a show that could get better over time.The three main cast members are great, the supporting cast is ok. This show looks and feels like something one might find on Comedy Central, rather than network TV or Premium Cable. That's not a bad thing, it works for CC and I'm sure it could work for Amazon.",Positive
Many interesting characters and unexpected events challenge your thinking on survival dynamics  of small groups of people. The series focuses on the social implications of inexplicable disaster. It reminds me of Journal of the Plague Year by Camus because the social and ethical thinking changes as the trouble progresses.,Positive
For someone who loves fantasy this show is excellent and very worthwhile.  The character development is appreciated and makes sense.  I hope it never gets cancelled.  It is one of the best of its kind.,Positive
"Great crime drama series!! All 5 seasons are fun, interesting and full of surprises!",Positive

"A bit like Californication in dialogue and characters, but I think it has more heart, a tough topic to handle with both wit and heart, but I think this show will do it",Positive
"I don't have cable or satellite & only watch DVD's. I initially came across Castle by accident & was hooked. I have all 5 seasons now & season 5, in my opinion, was the BEST yet!  This season finally ties up some loose ends we've been waiting for  the last 4 seasons - like who killed Kate's mother and who is Castle's father.  There were some good laughs and good suspense. The show is very well written & a real joy to watch. Very entertaining. I'm only sorry I have to wait another year for season 6 to come out on DVD.",Positive
"This show has become more solid and less histrionic with compelling developments of the next generation.  The maturation level of the parents, formally the children of Seth and Camille, has grown.  Meantime, the aging of the matriarch and patriarch is examined full on.  All generations are covered, each to their time and place, and it is an education on making choices in life, the good and the bad and, maybe, the midland.  Family friendly, yes, but not uncomplicated and not without a bit of mess but, then, that is how family works, isn't it?  A long way from the Waltons!",Positive
"""Monsters and Mysteries in America"" is a surprisingly good series shown at Destination America. It features interviews with people who claim to have encountered various paranormal creatures, plus reconstructions of the events.The producers have made absolutely no attempt to verify the various stories. They could be absurd tall tales, for all we know. Despite this, the show works. Some of the people on it are pretty good story tellers. Regardless whether you believe in monsters or not, you will probably find this to be entertaining, certainly on a rainy day!I admit that some of the supernatural beasts shown on ""Monsters and Mysteries"" are just too bizarre to be believable. Come and meet the Sheep-squatch (you heard me). Or how about Justin Smeja, the man who claimed he shot a Bigfoot in the Sierras? (John Muir would have a few unkind comments about *that*!) The shape-shifting werewolf Rougarou of Louisiana is another sure attraction on our tour, as is the Honey Island Swamp Monster, a Bigfoot-like creature with webbed, reptilian feet. A couple of classical cases are also revisited, including the alien attack on Sutton's farm in Kelly and Mothman of Point Pleasant.Are we really supposed to believe in these yarns? Perhaps not. However, the complete lack of any sceptic versus true believer confrontation actually makes them strangely relaxing to watch... Four stars for what might become a piece of modern Americana.",Positive
"Season 3 of Being Human (US) is my favorite and hits its pace as a show with a fully developed set of characters and story line.  With 13 episode seasons, character development has become a part of jumping on in on a moving story for all shows in which we have 13 episodes to know the characters, like/dislike them, and get vested in the story.  It took me a while but by season 3 I've settled into the mix of odd characters trying to live normal lives even though they are far from it.  They have solidified as a cast of characters that have bonded through joining together to help each out enough now that the them against the world theme sticks and allows for more humor to slip in as they get caught in some situations that could only be funny in the context of this show.  At this point I am hooked and am pulling for each of the characters and enjoy the show in how each supports each other in a unique way as they fail their way to figuring out how to make the odd situation they have put themselves in work.  It doesn't really, but that is what makes it interesting as they struggle through their attempts to be normal though they are far from it.  It took a while for it to all come together but season 3 achieves what was attempted all along as this group of misfit friends figure out how to live in the world and somehow get by even though they miss work half the time and are constantly pulling each other out of unique problems only a this group of monsters could be in.  Unique entertainment in an area of with a lot of competition but none like Being Human achieves!",Positive
"I stick with this show because the music is great, the acting is great...... the plot not so much. It's the typical TV show plot of the times - gay, drunk, murder, sex, back stabbing, pretty people with to much time and money in other words it's PC.",Negative
This is pretty funny. Didn't mind watching it and found several parts amuzing. Actors were very good in their roles and carried the content of this movie to its max.,Negative
The third episode was well written and acted.  The story line is gruesome and pulls no punches so do not expect a fairy tale ending!,Positive
"Ciaran Hinds is one of my favorite actors, so imagine my surprise, in watching this on an impulse (before reading reviews), to find him in it!  Amazon really needs to fine-tune its descriptions of Instant Video offerings.  While on the subject, am I the only one who's annoyed by the fact that they disclose major plot points in their episode descriptions- abandon ye ALL hopes of being surprised (yet, often don't bother to list the lead actors)??  Please fix this.***MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW*** I read a few of the reviews, and I agree with the quibbles about the lead actress behaving a little oddly, i.e., looking misty-eyed for no particular reason and wobbling about on stiletto heels after going through intensive DC training.  A slight qualm I had was the women referring to the main suspect as the handsomest man ever, with violet eyes that rivaled Liz Taylor's.  He wasn't, and they didn't, IMO.  And I believe I've seen nearly all of Hinds's films, something was decidely off about his accent- he sounded as though he was trying to effect an American accent part of the time (for example, his pronunciation of ""car"", bizarre).  Perhaps he was simultaneously working on an American production.But other than that, I thought it very well-done, absorbing, superb acting all around, especially in the final interrogation scene.  The two episodes were worth watching for that final scene alone.  I hate gratuitous violence- yes it was explicit, close to the bone, graphic, but NOT gratuitous, in my estimation, not designed merely to shock, but to get as close to the truth as possible (true of the entire show).  I thought the perpetrator's performance was a virtuoso one, chilling, an uber-realistic look into the mind and heart of a serial killer.  And the way his accent changed along with his demeanor and feelings, as he explored different time periods and memories- incredible, spot on.  I was absolutely riveted.  And the young DC matched him in intensity.As for reviewers deeming it impossible for romance to bloom between Ciaran Hinds and the young rookie, I can't agree there, were I in her shoes, I'd be smitten too.  Hinds is intelligent, wise, virile, authoritative, a little tired, craggy, yes, but with an engaging manner and twinkle in his eye, and in need of some TLC.  Irresistible.  And from a male perspective, Kelly Reilly has intriguing qualities of her own (among them, her tendency to discern issues/ angles that haven't occurred to others).  I liked those moments between them, and their subtlety.  While it's no Masterpiece Theater, it's certainly better than 99% of American CSI-type shows.  And as another reviewer wryly suggested, the Brits (with tongues firmly planted in their cheeks) handily beat Americans at their own game (cleavage, spike heels, maggots, red herrings, etc.)!  They did it SO much better.  Recommended!",Positive
I must have closed captions (as a hearing impaired person). I chose this program because the listing summary indicated that it was closed captioned. Enjoyed part 1 and then was very unhappy to discover part 2 is not captioned. Cannot understand why this situation exists. Better to have left off the CC indicator on part 1 and not fool us who are hard of hearing.,Negative
I love this series. I am from WY. and he fits the character. This year is written with questions left unanswered in each episode. Little by little more and more is revealed and I do like that. I just needed to get used to it. My biggest fear with something like that however is that the show wont be continued (many programs I have enjoyed have be cancelled) and then those questions wont be answered. Lets hope that does not happen.,Positive
"As long as you understand that Muckman is a comedy wrapped in the trappings of horror, this film delivers a surprisingly satisfying ride with plenty of laughs along the way.  Just look at what the film promises on the DVD cover: beautiful bikini babes brawling, unspeakable violence and gore, and terrifying monsters run amuck.  Throw in some good, old-fashioned stop motion monster effects, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a darn good recipe for a good time.  Obviously, this film doesn&#8217;t take itself too seriously, and neither should you.  Just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.So, once upon a time, there was a monster hunter who completely sabotaged the career of himself and his lovely co-host by getting caught faking a monster called the Muckman &#8211; on live TV, no less.  Now Mickey O&#8217;Hara (Steve Diasparra) and Asia Buchanan (Anju McIntyre) want a shot at redemption.  They&#8217;re taking a film crew back to the deep woods of rural Pennsylvania to capture real footage of the Muckman.  That crew includes a couple of clueless technical guys, some kind of personal assistant, and P.A. Billie Mulligan (Alison Whitney).  Whitney really outshines everyone else in the cast, as far as I&#8217;m concerned; hers is definitely the most well-developed (and attractive) character, despite everyone else treating her as little more than the group&#8217;s R.V. driver.  Anyway, our TV crew meets up with a local named Cletus and his two incredibly stupid cousins, and the hunt for Muckman begins.  What appears early on to be a pretty simple and hackneyed plot takes a number of interesting turns along the way.  Even Muckman is more than a few steps above your basic dude in a latex suit, thanks to director Billie Piper&#8217;s monster-making talents.  It&#8217;s as if someone actually put some thought into a low-budget monster B-movie, and that&#8217;s an all too rare occurrence.The face of the would-be Muckman documentary is played by Anju McIntyre (aka A.J. Khan), who you may remember from such films as Lord of the G-Strings, Kinky Casting Couch, and The Erotic Diary of Misty Mundae &#8211; well, you may not remember her from those films, but I do.  She doesn&#8217;t take her clothes off and play around with other girls in this film, though (heck, she isn&#8217;t even one of the participants in the impromptu bikini catfight that helps liven things up midway through).  If you do happen to be familiar with A.J. Khan, though, you&#8217;re probably also familiar with director Brett Piper, who has written, directed, and/or done the special effects for such low-budget horror films as Bite Me!, Screaming Dead, and A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell.  If you have no budget and need decent special monster effects or a more than capable writer/director, Billie Piper has to be on your short list.This whole thing was reportedly cranked out for a mere 50 grand, proving once again that you can&#8217;t judge a movie by its budget.  I don&#8217;t know about Muckman being &#8220;the terror you will never forget,&#8221; but I know I won&#8217;t soon forget the many laughs I enjoyed while watching it.",Positive

"The Innkeepers (Ti West, 2011)Pretty much everyone I know with whom I have discussed The Innkeepers considers it a better movie than Ti West's previous one, The House of the Devil, and one of the reasons I have held off on reviewing it for as long as I have&#8212;I actually watched it for the first time well over a year ago as I write this opening paragraph&#8212;is that after I watched it, I vehemently disagreed. Nothing has happened in the ensuing fifteen months, including rewatching sections of the movie, sometimes obsessively, and discussing it to death with a few folks to try and get what it was I'm missing, but nothing has managed to sway me from my conviction that The House of the Devil is, quite simply, a much better-made film that is more successful at tapping into the homage it's going for than is The Innkeepers. Which is not, I should rush to add (but, curiously, I have not) to say that The Innkeepers is in any way not good. It is still, compared to most recent Hollywood horror fare, head and shoulders above anything else from a major studio you are likely to see within the next year, unless of course Ti West releases something (and doesn't suddenly revert to the guy who made such awful movies as The Roost).Plot: Claire (The Last House on the Left's Sara Paxton) and Luke (Rescue Dawn's Pat Healy) are the last two employees left working at a hotel that is slated for demolition, and all they have to do is get through their last weekend of unremitting boredom, go home, and then forget this place ever existed, right? Well, maybe not. They've never been swamped with customers, but for some reason, there's a steady stream of them this weekend. Well, a trickle, at least. More than usual. And some of them start reporting weird occurrences on the upper floors, leading to the conclusion that, perhaps, this won't be a boring weekend after all; Luke has long been researching the hotel's supposedly haunted past, and Sara finds herself reluctantly drawn into his obsession. But one of the cardinal rules of dealing with haunted places: you don't ever want to try to get the ghosts to talk to you...It's a fun little movie with a killer cast (Kelly McGillis, John Speredakos, Alison Bartlett O'Reilly, etc.) that spends much of its time suggesting, rather than showing, what's going on, and on that level, it succeeds just as well as its predecessor. But I mentioned the homage factor. I kind of have to dance around it here because saying what specific movie it pays homage to would give the entire final sequence away (but if you've got any exposure to the history of horror film, you'll know it the second you see it), but (a) it is obvious that West is once again paying homage here, and once you've seen the final sequence, going back and rewatching certain key scenes will show you it's not limited to the end of the movie, and (b) it's still a glancing blow, as opposed to the bullseye that was The House of the Devil vs. every Satanic Panic movie of the seventies (though if you want a specific movie, the one that always goes most through my head where The House of the Devil is concerned is The Night God Screamed, but kind of in reverse). Because of that, I think, that final sequence, and the denouement that follows it, got robbed of a lot of their power. (And oh, for the love of The Hills Have Eyes, did we really need that final shot? In case you're wondering, Magic 8-ball says &#8220;NO.&#8221;) Still, it's a great deal of fun; just remind yourself that the draggy sections are there for a reason. *** ",Positive
This show is too good. I can't help but put this one all the time. The set is nice n small in size so it doesn't take a lot of room on the self.,Positive
"We Steal Secrets: The Story of Wikileaks is a mixed bag at best. On the plus side, We Steal Secrets is brilliantly crafted, well-filmed and edited, and fast-paced and as exciting as a Hollywood thriller. On the negative side, the director clearly had a personal vendetta against Assange by the end, giving too much light to fishy stories of assault in Sweden and his melancholy time holed up in various safe houses.I have no idea why Alex Gibney, obviously a fine director, chose such obviously one-sided sources. We mostly hear from outcasts like Daniel Domscheit-Berg and other ""former"" WikiLeaks supporters, and too much screentime is given to some extremely questionable stories from the woman Assange allegedly sexually assaulted. Neither Bradley Manning nor Julian Assange were directly interviewed, which is obviously a huge blow to the film. We Steal Secrets starts out hopeful and mysterious, detailing the huge leaks perpetrated by conflicted soldier Bradley Manning, and the rise of Wikileaks - the triumphant exposures of heinous war crimes, lies, and secrets swept under the rug by various countries and organizations. Wikileaks gave us the truth on the Iraqi War and the War on Terror that no one else would. But the documentary tries to paint it, AND Assange (which I find heavily ironic since We Steal Secrets is against those who targeted Assange in person) as a controlling, paranoid, suspicious bunch of wierdos.Look, I'm NOT saying to paint Assange as a white knight in shining armor. He's a human being, full of faults and shortcomings, doubts and weaknesses. He's also one of the great visionaries of our time: a controversial and engimatic figure that dared to show us the secrets that our governments wouldn't. Along with whistleblowers like Manning and now, Edward Snowden, and organizations such as The Pirate Party and Anonymous, these individuals seek a more transparent, honest, and safer world. Thomas Jefferson said, ""A government afraid of it's people is democracy. A people afraid of their government is a tyranny.""When you look at it that way, WikiLeaks is a fight against tyranny. Freedom of speech, press, movement, and belief are untouchable rights of every human being. We must fight against tyranny alongside them. Long live sites like Wikileaks!In conclusion, We Steal Secrets is fascinating and provocative, but also biased and not as insightful as it might hope. Seek the truth out for yourself to make your own opinions, but this is in NO way a bad documentary, and I rather enjoyed it! A very solid 3 stars!",Negative
"Aah, I thought I knew what was going to happen. I didn't. Not gonna tell. My jaw dropped once or twice. The writing is swift, sure, knowing. Played well. Highly innovative? Deeply creative? Waaal, mebbe not. But, like hearing familiar music played with gusto, sometimes it's better than an earnest creative effort. The scenes played seamlessly in to each other, dialogue worked from tension to reveal in swift, evocative steps. Nice work.",Negative
"Life in the Five Points area of NYC in the 1860's was harsh, as my own ancestors could have attested. Things were made worse by the low character of some of its residents, but there were also good people, like the main characters, who tried to do right, sometimes aided, and sometime impeded, by their social, but not always moral, &#34;betters.&#34; This show takes you right into the middle of it all -- and is definitely only for adults.",Positive
Every single episode makes me laugh. I love Andy Samberg. I hope this show gets the attention it deserves and has a long life.,Positive
"Like 2011's ""Margin Call"", ""Arbitrage"" is a film that exploits the public's fascination with the world of high finance following the global economic crisis. Both films were written and directed by sons of Wall Street traders, who grew up in that environment. Unlike ""Margin Call"", ""Arbitrage"" does not attempt to say much about the financial world, much less the financial crisis. Instead, ""Arbitrage"" is a character study of a hedge fund manager whose world comes crashing down in the wake of bad decisions and bad luck. Robert Miller (Richard Gere) is a self-made magnate, owner of Miller Capitol, who finds himself in need of a lot of cash after an investment in a Russian copper mine is tied up by regulatory laws and foreign bureaucracy. He needs to sell his company to Standard Bank & Trust, and he has borrowed $412 million to plug the holes in his books until the sale. In the meantime, tragedy strikes when his mistress is killed in an accident that could derail the whole deal.Robert Miller is a relatively common name, but it happens to be the name of a real billionaire who made his fortune in duty-free shops and whose daughters frequently grace the society pages. I thought this was a strange coincidence. There is no relation to Robert Miller of the film. Miller is an energetic, domineering man who worked his way from the middle class to a Gramercy Park mansion, a stylish wife (Susan Sarandon) who occupies herself with endless charity functions, a grown son and daughter who work at his company, and an exotic artist-mistress whom he sponsors. He has a lot on his shoulders, and suddenly it all goes to pot. He can't tell anyone. He must cope the way he knows best: wheel and deal and exude confidence. Will he land on his feet? Do we want him to? He's not a bad guy, but he's not especially likeable either. He is no more or less ethical than average. Richard Gere has played this role before, notably in ""Unfaithful"", a more sophisticated film.There's nothing original here, but the cast is good. There is a practical, world-weary wife. A temperamental mistress who craves attention. A morally superior but nave daughter. A son who has proven to be a disappointment. It's unfortunate that Susan Sarandon does not have more to do. Tim Roth steals his scenes as a crooked, desperate police detective. A stereotype, yes, but Roth makes him menacing. Nate Parker is sympathetic as a young man to whom Miller turns for help and who ends up in a very bad spot on account of it. On one hand, I felt that there should be more to this story. And the police investigation into the accident strains credibility. On the other hand, stock characters are not a bad way to begin a career in filmmaking. This is Nicholas Jarecki's first effort at directing a feature and second screenwriting effort. ""Arbitrage"" looks good. And the cast elevates a hackneyed script into an entertaining and suspenseful character study.The DVD (Lionsgate 2012): There are 6 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary. ""A Glimpse into Arbitrage"" (12 min) interviews the film's producers, director Nicholas Jarecki, and several members of the cast about the ideas behind the film and its locations. ""Who Is Robert Miller?"" (7 min) interviews the cast and director about the Miller character and Gere's performance. There is an audio commentary by writer/director Nicholas Jarecki, who explains how he came to be interested in making films, this film's conception, trials in getting it made, and eventually gets around to commenting on the actual film. He goes into detail about Miller's financial situation, his character, and the motivation of characters, as well as some technical details. Comment is constant but not always about what's on screen. Subtitles are available for t he film in English and Spanish.",Positive

"After cannibalizing nearly all of TOS series, they ran out of ideas. This one is so, so lame.Their fantasy of Trip-the George Bush-ish NASCAR like mechanic-that beds an exotic beautiful woman and has an immaculate conception. Whose twisted fantasy is this. Lol. And then of course it is back to the evil man and his evil machine to kill all other races, echoing the Nazis in the first episode of this year's shows. This is new? This show is so full of mish-mash tripe that I am so glad there are no more. This last season was certainly painful to watch. I did enjoy most of season three however, and the overriding story arch with the unusual harshness of the decisions Captain Archer has to make, making it a truly deep emotional engaging show. The first three seasons were good overall and this one is a plane going down in a ball of flames. This next to last episode is the crash with the fireball.",Negative
"You would expect a thinking creature who has lived hundreds of years would be smart enough to use it's accumulated knowledge to do something to make the world a better place.

The multiple layers of story lines and the new twists to a much seen tale make this a ""Must See"" series for all of us who love a good vampire story and all of us who enjoy television shows for thinking adults.  None of the episodes have been ""Dummied"" down for the 6 year old to 14 year old viewer!  YEA!

"CENTURION (2010, 97 minutes) is a fine endless battle-and-chase-and-battle-and-final-gigantic-showdown-battle Roman-era film. That is, if you like this sort of meaningless tripe action film. Set in 117 A.D., and as always centering on the mysteriously vanished 9th Legion, Michael Fassbender actually gives an unusually riveting performance as Centurion Quintus Dias. That's right, they gave him a Spanish name that probably wasn't even in existence yet, but Romans will be Romans in whatever century they occupy.Of course, as I translate the only-half-authentic Roman name, it is symbolic: I narrowed its translation to either a literal ""Five Days"" or the much more humorous, symbolic ""Days [are] Numbered"". An even funnier way to read it is ""How Many Days"" and I assume that should end with a question mark. Yep. ""Quintus Dias"" does it to me every time.Here, north of Hadrian's then-new wall, Dias and only a few others survive horrific, gore-laced battles with the Picts (who amazingly speak modern Irish Gaelic, right down to the Anglicized mispronunciations, instead of speaking Pictish, which language is a mystery to us anyway).I began laughing as they were haunted and hunted by a vicious, supernatural Pictish woman called Etaine (wrongly credited as ""Etain"", a Goth makeup nightmare by the name of Olga Kurylenko). Those ladies were tough fighters but they weren't like this. This lady mows down Romans as if they were Legos.There isn't much for me to add to this. There are just too many other films running along these lines, such as the equally ghastlyKing Arthur(2004, see my review),300(2006), the excellent family filmThe Last Legion(2007, see my review) and the equally excellent and underratedThe Eagle(2011, see my review). Of these, THE EAGLE and THE LAST LEGION are by far the finest.I was very impressed by the beautiful Imogen Poots who plays Arianne, the outcaste Pictish witch. Actually she is a healer who got the bad end of the stick - much like Dias will discover he's getting from the Empire after he gets back home. Though here agin a major stumble, since she is altogether far too reminiscent of Sam Neill inMerlin (Special Edition)(see my review).One thing I can say I am heartily sick of seeing is the set of common refrains running through these films (I back down from 300 because I have no time for a film like that): you can always count on stupid anachronisms galore, phony Celtic peoples (""Hey, why not make 'em all Irish?""), a Roman on a stupid quest, other colorful foreigners fighting with the Roman on his stupid quest, badly spoken Gaelic or Gobbledygook, Ice Age weather, very bad history overall, vast oceans of blood, violent battles that go on too long and finally, Romans deciding Britain is the pure land and defecting from the Empire.Oh, and let us not forget Hadrian's Wall, which is a bit like the obligatory pratfall in every comedy. It is poetic, a little bit of it is occasionally true - for the most part it is a repetitive bore to see that stuff repeated ad nauseam. Hey! Maybe they should have named Fassbender's Roman soldier Ad Nauseam. Better than Your Days Are Numbered.My recommendation is you watch the other films I mentioned before you see this one. You may find once you've seen a bit of it that you don't want to waste your time watching regurgitations. Then again, you just might develop a bit of a soft spot in your heart for this thing, as I did.It was the really good Roman-era Arthurian film (THE LAST LEGION) and the stunning quasi-gay-Roman-plus-Celt-love story (THE EAGLE) that created that soft spot. Only, I hope it doesn't turn out to be a softness in my head!",Negative
This is the show my husband likes.  It seems very interesting. I hope to see it on the air for some time!,Positive
"I like it, but probably won't spend the money for it weekly. Having some trouble keeping it connected too, might be when I'm connecting.",Positive
"This movie was pretty good.  I always think movies about multiple personalities are interesting, but this one adds a twist that is pretty cool.  A little mystery, a little ghost story, a little thriller.  The ending was a little weak but the road to get there was cool.  Julianne Moore is really good, as is the other starring actors.  Definitely worth a few bucks for a night in.",Positive
"I was in Rome in December of 2007.  It was an amazing experience.  This is one of the reasons I so much enjoy this series.  It is not filmed on sets designed to look like Rome.  The city itself is one of the major characters.  I love seeing the camera pan by some of the places I visited.  I love seeing the city as it is, horrible graffiti and all.  I think the whole look of the program is just way above some of the other detective programs out there.  Although corruption and subterfuge are major plot points, the mood of each show is not dark and grim. The acting is superb.  I've always enjoyed Rufus Sewell's acting.  I'm not familiar with the Italian actress who plays Tania, but she's done a great job.  I like the fact that they're not beating you over the head with the romance.  These are mature adults, not young twenty-somethings trying to steal a moment in a storage room at work.  I also find it interesting that Zen, who is the ""hero,"" lives with his mother.  Normally, that's a red flag.  But Rufus Sewell makes it OK. I also like the music.  I was so disappointed that the BBC decided to cancel the series and not make any more.  Imagine how overjoyed I was to find that Amazon put it on Prime Instant Videos for free for Prime members.  Now I can watch it on a lazy weekend whenever I want.  It's kind of like me and Star Wars.  Yeah, I've seen it a thousand times.  Yeah, I pretty much know every line.  Yeah, I absolutely know how it's going to end.  But, I still like watching it anyway and it never gets old.",Positive
I made it through almost half of the opening song (probably about a minute and a half).  I should have turned it off after the first 30 seconds.This must be some kind of goof right?,Negative
"Wow, I love this show.  There is suddenly a big influx of fun, original shows and this is one of them.  It's so cool and addictive and I'm hooked now.Minnie Driver is fantastic as Dahlia Malloy who is part of a family of con artists.  She is on parole from having served time in prison for petty robbery and larceny.  Her and her husband Wayne are now on the move with their three kids.  They're travelling in an RV when they are witness to a car crash, and making a long story short, they end up assuming the identities of a wealthy family, the Riches, and move to an upscale neighborhood in Palm Beach Florida.  Wayne needs to find work to support the family's new lifestyle so his first scam begins when he tries for a job with his neighbor at his law firm.I can't tell you in words just how good this is.  It's such a cool show that you have to check out for yourself.  It's fun and enjoyable and Minnie Driver is brilliant in here.  I love watching how these guys get away with all the things they do and it's certainly addictive.  Get yourself a copy and you'll have a new favourite show for sure.",Positive
"""Turn"" the new AMC drama about George Washington's Culper spy ring is based on the book ""Washington's Spies"" by Alexander Rose. The story revolves around farmer turned spy Abraham Woodhull, ably played by Jamie Bell. He, his wife and friends, Anna Strong, Caleb Brewster and Captain Talmadge match wits with It has some of the most memorable villains that I have ever seen: Major Robert Rogers of the Queen's Rangers; Major John Andre, the British Army's spymaster; the lecherous Capt. John Simcoe, who's intentions are anything but honorable; and the oddly sinister Major Hewlett, Commanding Officer of the British Garrison at Setauket, Long Island. It also is a compelling story of genuine heroism at the time of our nation's birth.Unfortunately, it also has some of the worst research, staging and writing that I have ever witnessed. Scenes are sometimes so ill managed that it has become a part of my enjoyment of the series to laugh at the antics of the characters. We're talking over the top blunders of epic proportions. Examples are plentiful: Early in the pilot the notorious Major Rogers and his Queen's Rangers ambush a group of ""Connecticut Dragoons."" The battle scene is awash with blood, men's bodies strewn `round-about, but there are no horses, not even a dead one. Why is that important? Dragoons were mounted infantry, or heavy cavalry, and they rode into battle! Not having horses cluttering up the scene cuts down on production costs I am sure, so perhaps next time you should just call the ""Dragoons"" infantry, okay? Another monstrous mistake occurs in the third episode when Abraham Woodhall and his father, the owner of 25 fattened hogs, make a contract with a British officer to sell said hogs to the Redcoats for 7 per pound. Just for the sake of argument let us say that each hog weighs 200 pounds, so the total weight of the pork is 5000 pounds (200 x 25 = 5000). Now multiply that times 7 and you get 35,000, right? You realize that means those hogs were worth seven times their weight in silver? I don't want to let the cat out of the bag but the British Pound Sterling was originally backed by a pound of silver (troy weight), sterling silver to be exact. That is why it is called the ""Pound Sterling."" Some one needs to let the writers know that 1 was a lot of money in 1776. To put it in perspective a skilled workman earned about that amount for a week's work.There are so many errors that plague this production, that I could go on for a while yet. But, in sum, ""Turn"" isn't awful, it just lacks attention to detail and a bit of common sense. It's strength lies in the connivances and complexities of Loyalists, Redcoats and Patriots of that time. Kudos also to Jamie Bell and company for some pretty good acting in the face of blockheaded writing.Since it is based on fact perhaps it is a story that would be better told in documentary form?  Anyway, I'll be watching to see if it improves, and to enjoy the heroism of patriots and wickedness of villains.",Positive
Waiting for Season 4 to be on Prime. Love this series. Great Series. Wish there were more like it. for sure,Positive
"My daughter was really into this when she was maybe 2.  She has since moved on to Doc McStuffins and Sofia the First.  I sadly, have not.  It's very reminiscent of an 80's video game with good music.  The Halloween episode is particularly great.",Positive
"The movie was not awful nor bad. it was not too boring and action did not make me wait. While there are some movie mistakes like where people seem to walk fast and step strong as if it was on our planet, and some questionable scenes, I found the plot to be quite interesting and good because it's different. Sure the walking dead people is one of those questionable things about the movie, it may not seem realistical, but I didn't care. It was interesting to see somethign new and different. it wasn't a stupid plot. Sure infected people may remind of zombies, but they are not zombies, they act different. While the movie is far from great it is worth watching. I didn't find characters interesting, yet the story, the red planet, it just all that matterred to me. I liked it.",Negative

"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE  Teen Wolf! This is a series that delivers. In my opinion this is a GREAT competitor for True Blood, in storyline, special effects, comedy, the whole sha-bang! Dylan O'Brien makes the character Stiles seem so much like you're actually watching someone you personally know or have known in your life just being themselves in their natural skin, this is a special gift that he possesses. I think Lydia even adds a comedic facet from the feminine perspective. The team that compiled and put together this this delicious recipe of great actors/actresses should be made into royalty! I just finished watching the first two seasons on Netflix and caught up on season 3 on MTV and was NOT ONCE disappointed in an scene or episode. The occultic special effects weren't hokey in any shape, size, or form, no pun intended, lol, but lent you to believe that if there really were werewolves, this is what/how they would appear. I'm droolin' as I'm texting in anticipation of the next episode!",Positive

"This Show is wonderful! It has a Great Young but very experienced cast with people from other great shows like the Wire to House to Shameless on it! They all shine, even the actors i was not familiar with!The Stories are not just about a series of Fires either like shows of this ilk usually are. Their are episodes about the firefighters personal lives, People getting shot, car accidents, great fire scenes and even Love scenes that are not ""Flakey!"" Bad cops, Good cops, Drug addiction and so much more.I would certainly watch this show if you have not seen it. It`s a wonderful piece of work.",Positive
DR whoozeee cant get the show any more.  had to request additional channels to watch everything.  even stayed up late. (sat 2 or  3  am.)  enjoyed so much.  When does the next season start.  i'm waiting!!!!!,Positive
I hated Bad Teacher because I didn't think the teacher was bad enough. These three are truly bad teachers. The scene where he tries to buy drugs with his kid is hilarious! I would definitely watch this again.,Positive

Great casting.Fascinating lead character and gripping plots as well as an interesting background story unfolding..I can't wait for the next episode.,Positive
"This one has to be the best super hero adaptation since Smallville.  It follows the mythology of the original somewhat.  However I'm fascinated by the obsession this character has.  Much like a certain Dark Knight we are familiar with.  After being stranded on a desert island, he comes back to civilization.  The main character's deceased father left a list of names. His only living son must track down and eliminate them to save his father's company and his legacy.  Little did his father know that the people that worked for him were all in organized crime.  Not only do I like this show, I plan to buy the DVD when it is out.  I can only hope that this one lasts half as long as smallville.",Positive
"Alphas, as always, was amazing. I loved Season 2 even more!! Twists and turns and excellent screen writing abound!! A must see for any Alphas lover!!",Positive
I actually enjoyed this movie until the end. It was entertaining and the characters were interesting. However I was so disappointed with the ending that the best rating I could give is 3 stars.,Negative
The last episode is very telling for the lead character and his wife - unanticipated !!!Will they ever get back together?,Positive
My daughter and I watch this show often and I must say it is equal to watching Dora to learn some spanish. I enjoy learning the Chinese language this way too. Good show!,Positive
"I enjoyed the pilot. It was good, not great, but has the potential to be very good. It all comes down to character development. There were enough interesting characters here to make this a show interesting assuming that writers are talented. If Amazon decides to go forward with this series, I'll give it a try. But, I'm not convinced!",Positive
"This was a good show, a little out there at times but did a great job of keeping you thinking the whole time.  I am looking forward to watching the next one.",Positive
"The Event Season 1 is pretty good. I wished that they continued for season 2. But again how long can you drag this age old myth of aliens living amongst humans? The flashbacks and flash forwards are annoying at times but it does keep you engaged for the whole season due to some nice action packed drama scenes.Having said, definitely worth watching the whole season if you are into Sci-Fi series four stars from me!",Positive
this show kept me falling off the chair every time...i never knew lawyer are smart but this show is much smarter lawyer just kidding!!!,Positive

I love Kevin Bacon and loved the suspense of this show!  Had me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait until the next season!,Positive
What a gorgeous cast of characters.  Storyline is very entertaining as well.  It was fun to see one of the stars of &#34;Sparticus&#34; here!,Positive
This new season does not disappoint! It totally remains suspenseful! All the characters are still the same and this season gives you more details about their past lives! Purchase well spent!,Positive
"I really like the stories and the actors are a great ensemble cast.  The writing is creative and Vera is entertaining.  She can get a little on your nerves, but the actor David Leon has just the right touch to ground the show and bring it back into reality.  Loved both seasons.",Positive
"Really enjoyed Season 1 and that's why I purchased season 2 - but the roles became a bit too quirky and totally unreal and I did not like that Detective Reese was replaced - did not like the chemistry between them.I have one last episode to watch and am not rushing to watch it.  However, Damian is a fabulous actor - great facial acting.",Negative
Think this is funny to watch some of it is irritating but sometimes interesting finds but theres no way I would spend that much money on some of those lockers no no lol,Positive
"I love the show, all of the episodes are great!  Except the Bobby Flay episodes.  I'm not a fan of his culinary technique.  But all the rest of the iron chefs are very inventive! Plus the challengers they go up against, WOW!  I'm always impressed by what they can make.  One challenger made Flat Steak Ice Cream!  I've no clue what that would taste like, and it sounds revolting, but I'm so intrigued that I'd probably try a bite or two just because I've never heard of anything else like it.  My wife and I really enjoy this show and totally recommend it to anyone else out there who likes to watch cooking shows!",Positive
"So this season is when the show jumped the shark. It's dull, boring, and lackluster. I'm wondering if they lost a crucial writer or if everyone got bored. What I loved about this show was the dynamics of the relationships between the characters, but that seems to be really flat this season. On top of that, Callie is both boring, whiney, and bitchy all at the same time, so I just wonder why anyone puts up with her for more than a minute, and hope that I don't have to either. I will finish watching the season eventually because I really enjoyed the first three seasons. But this season has lost something and I recommend waiting for it to be prime.",Negative
"Got completely hooked after watching the first episode.  Looking forward to the second series.All the cast was great, especially Mads Mikkelson.",Positive
"Europa One is the first mission to send humans into deep space. In ""Europa Report,"" six astronauts are sent to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, to see if life exists beneath the icy exterior of the planetoid. Studies show that single-celled organisms may exist in a probable hidden ocean beneath the hefty layers of ice. As being alone in the depths of space begins to take its toll on each of the crew members, equipment on the spacecraft starts to malfunction including their means of communication back home. Tragedy rears its ugly head as the crew on the Europa One mission struggle between making one of the most important discoveries in the history of mankind and surviving long enough to actually make it back home.One of the biggest mistakes ""Europa Report"" makes is that it lets you know very early on that nobody survives the trip to Europa. It would have been even more effective if you had just heard the testimony of Dr. Samantha Unger (Embeth Davidtz), CEO of Europa Ventures, without being told ahead of time the fate of the crew. The science fiction film is presented like a documentary containing footage from on-board cameras and interviews with the crew. As you become accustomed to the crew, you can't help but realize how realistic everything seems. The special effects do an excellent job making this shuttle and its outer space exhibition feel authentic. While ""Europa Report"" does deal with discovering new life, it never seems to overstep the bounds of reality as the decisions made and the related consequences feel logical.Isolation sets in and the majority of the crew begins to feel its effects; James Corrigan (Sharlto Copley) gets the worst of it. Copley's performance is perhaps the most emotional in the film despite the South African actor having a limited amount of screen time. If anyone in ""Europa Report"" goes through a story arc similar to Dr. Ryan Stone's (Sandra Bullock) from ""Gravity,"" it's James Corrigan. Just keep in mind that there's no rescuing this time around. The cast is fairly solid from all sides, but Michael Nyqvist also stands out. Nyqvist portrays Andrei, the chief engineer, and Andrei's experiences are a bit more extraordinary in comparison to the rest of the crew.The first person perspective adds quite a bit to the film as does having a camera inside the suits of the crew as you get an intimate outlook that captures all of their facial expressions and emotions. It's a bit disappointing to see so many characters perish so similarly. However when you're surrounded by ice, there's really only one way you can go. The only real payoff is the last shot of the footage seen from Europa One. You'll know it once you see it. Anything Lovecraftian in design deserves some recognition. Coming back to the special effects, while they're mostly very good and add so much to the film they're also a bit funky once the crew arrives on Europa. It's excusable since it's something most humans will most likely never see, but the terrain of Europa is a bit off-balance in comparison to everything else in the film.""Europa Report"" is never really able to capitalize on the intense atmosphere that it hints at early on. While it does look and feel genuine at times and you're not ever able to shake that wondrous sensation of potential discovery, ""Europa Report"" fails to ever really wow its audience. While it may share similarities with the number one film to hit theaters this past weekend, ""Europa Report"" is no ""Gravity.""Special features on the Blu-ray release include Exploring the Visual Effects of Europa Report (6:37), The Musical Journey of Europa Report (5:41), a Behind the Scenes Photo Gallery, and the Theatrical Trailer.",Negative
"Terrence Malick is one of those directors that I don&#8217;t always click with.  I know that he has a very large and supporting group of rabid fans and yet I have yet to be truly mesmerized by him since his debut, &#8216;Badlands&#8217;.  What I have always admired about Malick is that he tries to come at very deep rooted and intellectual subjects from a vantage point of almost complete detachment, allowing us to hover over these subjects without beating us over the head with them.  He&#8217;s focused on war and faith and death and celebrity and in each of these instances, even when I don&#8217;t feel the film worked as a whole, you find this otherworldly atmosphere thanks to Malick&#8217;s thickly laced scope of ideas.I&#8217;ve said this time and time again, but Malick is a director who tends to get in his own way.&#8216;To the Wonder&#8217; is, in my eyes, the most disjointed, distracted and overall uneven film Malick has directed.  While I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to his use of visual imagery and whispered voice over to create his &#8216;point&#8217;, the use of those images and whispers only reduced &#8216;To the Wonder&#8217; to an elongated commercial for Zoloft.The synopsis here is rather simple.  Neil meets the free spirited Marina in Paris, where he sweeps her off her feet and brings her and her daughter back to his home in Oklahoma.  Their relationship starts to crumble almost immediately and soon Marina and her daughter pack up and leave.  In her absence, Neil starts to court Jane, a former flame, only to have Marina crawl back home and convince him to marry her, leaving Jane out to pasture.  Marriage doesn&#8217;t fix the crack in their marriage though, and soon they find themselves at violent odds.  While all of this is happening, the Spanish pastor in their town is, apparently, struggling with his grasp on his own faith.I&#8217;m honestly not sure what Father Quintana has to do with this story, at all (completely reminded me of the useless Sean Penn segment in &#8216;Tree of Life&#8217;), but Javier Bardem was easily the best thing about the movie so I hate to say it should have been removed from the film.  In all honesty, this felt like a really bad editing issue.  Terrence Malick is notorious for chopping his films in half.  There was that controversy over &#8216;The Thin Red Line&#8217; where he actually cut Adrian Brody right out of the film, and he was slated to be THE STAR.  So, it&#8217;s no surprise that Rachel McAdams has like three scenes, but it is disheartening that the Father Quintana storyline feels like a poorly developed subplot.  There is absolutely no flow between these two storylines, despite having Marina briefly confide in Father Quintana about her relationship with Neil (and by &#8216;briefly&#8217; I literally mean for about five seconds).  Instead, these two stories feel ripped from two separate films and so I really feel like there is very important footage that was left on the cutting room floor that could have developed this into a more cohesive story.Or maybe Malick just wrote a story void of those essential bones.I think that is a major issue I take with this.  Even from a purely spiritual or emotional standpoint, &#8216;To the Wonder&#8217; feels vacant.  In dissecting the relationship between Marina and Neil, the film goes nowhere.  Their issues are never explored, their fights are never revealed and their tumultuous relationship is pretty much a repetition of pictures that reduce Marina to an obnoxious woman who prances around and wants to be tickled and Neil to a grump who pouts at the camera or walks out of the room with his eyes cast down at his feet.  There is no meat here, no actual character development and so we can&#8217;t care for them at all.  The spiritual angle of faith feels like an afterthought, since Bardem&#8217;s scenes are sparse and feel like such a tack on I almost couldn&#8217;t take them as part of the same film.Yes, &#8216;To the Wonder&#8217; is beautiful, but it has nothing to say.",Negative
"Great characters and great actors.  I feel bad about routing for the likes of Boyd Crowder, but I can't help myself.  Can't wait for the next season to be available on Amazon Prime.",Positive
"I liked it. They finally answered the question of how he was going to continue past his limit of regenerations. HIs transformation was Grand! And as we loved this actors work. He showed us he loved his time as the Doctor and didn't want to leave even when he was already gone. I will miss Matt Smith as the doctor but, I know I will enjoy the new episodes just as much. Peter Capaldi is a great actor and I feel he will walk in the doctors shoes very well. I am a fan of the doctor and I am glad to see the show continue to bring the great entertainment it has all my 47 years. I hope it will continue for a long time to come.",Positive
I could rate this higher in the end.  I've only watched the first two episodes.  Good acting.  Pretty good story so far.,Negative
I love 24 live another day! It really keeps along with the original 24! I was at the edge of my seat the whole time!,Positive
"Being a fan of Betty White's, I'm happy that they brought my beloved Golden Girl to the show.  She makes an excellent, crazy, and horrifying witch lady.  I hope I've seen all the episodes now.  I recall a few months earlier when I was surfing TV late night when I saw Betty White in the description for this show.  I've been hooked on it ever since.  TBS re-aired the episode, so hopefully I'm now all caught up.  Too bad that the show was cancelled fairly early on.  I really did like the simple lessons that Earl gave.Honorable mention: I love Nescobar-A-Lop-Lop name.  It always puts a smile on my face.Earl is just as naive as ever in this episode.Joy is just as bitchy as ever.Darnel is just as ""nice"" as ever.Randy is just as simple as ever.Kenny is just as gay as ever.Catalina is just as cuckoo as ever.and ex-deputy Mike is just as lackadaisical as ever.I love the creativity of the writers - this show is hilarious with all the funny flashbacks.  Don't drink the tea!",Positive
Any fan of Warehouse 13 will not be disappointed with this years Christmas Episode. It's heart warming and funny at the same time. Reality minus Pete being born is a hoot; check out the picture of the President behind Myka's desk in her office; this sets the pace for the laughter. I highly recommend this episode.,Positive
This is one of the most entertaining series we've watched and what makes it so cool is that it inter-connects with Eureka. which is equally as good. sometimes the characters from Eureka appear on warehouse 13 and vice versa so we bounce back and forth between the 2 of them. meaning we watch one season of warehouse 13 then watch a season of Eureka. you will just love these 2 series. Try them and you will see.,Positive
"Honestly, I'd give the second half of Season 4 about a 3 because some of those episodes were BORING, especially the one featuring just Daryl and Beth.  But &#34;The Grove&#34; episode and the finale &#34;A&#34; more than made up for my suffering.  Can I just say that I like Ride-or-Die Rick much better than Farmer Rick.  Can't wait for Season 5.",Positive
Coming from Chris Carter I have high hopes for this one.  The pilot didn't hook me though due to the poor acting.  I'm not sure where this show is going and that's one reason I would like to see more.  A interesting and spooky end of the world thriller that has potential.,Negative
It was soothing to watch but it did not feel like I was looking at an aquarium. Still I use it as white noise back ground.,Positive
I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the Season 2 videos.  Too few episodes is my only complaint.  It is well written and well acted.,Positive
"While its combination of almost surreal humor and real emotion can sometimes be... well... awkward, this is still among thebetter and more honest series about teenagers I've seen.I'm a male over 50, so I'm certainly not the target audience for this MTV show about a blogging 15 year old girl dealing withthe confusions and absurdities of sex, love, high school social politics, and well meaning but humorously dysfunctional parentsand guidance counselors.But after friends recommended it I started watching and found I appreciated it's frankness, quirky characters and good natured humor.I also liked how it dealt with issues like sex and drinking as simply a part of teenage life, neither preaching morality (kids have sex andno one gets pregnant, they know to wear condoms, and they do sometimes get their hearts broken) nor striving to shock.The acting is all over the place, often cartoony, and a number of characters are little more than comic clich&eacute;s, but as the the show goesalong a surprising number of them reveal new sides and new depth.  If not quite great, Awkward season 1 is quite good and very easyto enjoy... if you don't mind bringing back some of your own awkward memories as you realize the teen years really aren't so different now.",Positive
"Giving 4 stars to Under the Dome Season 2 because it continues the story line with the same characters and takes the fictitious journey further, while still not answering some questions. I watched the entire season without losing interest.",Positive
This series and the charioteers will be missed. I have enjoyed seeing what would happen every week and the calamities that would befall Jack Carter. I am happy that he and Alison finally got together and would love to have a house like he lives in although I would want it solar power backup due to the electrical grid problems.....LOL...,Positive
"Loved this series when it was on tv, but it got cancelled.  So I am so happy it is available in DVD.",Positive
"Simon Baker is perfectly cast as the Mentalist.  I doubt if he will ever find another role like this.  He has reached iconic statu, so it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role.  The supporting actors around him are well cast and the chemistry between him and Robin Tunney is perfectly balanced.",Positive
"I enjoyed the humor in this particular series although they too got a little off color, but I really like Dawn French!",Positive
The characters continue to develop with more authentic and entertaining personalities.  Some of the &#34;underlying&#34; storey lines are a bit weak but the main plot is still exciting.,Positive
This season is very intense. It is more serious and on the edge of your seat stuff going on. Still has a lot of fun in it and action but a bit more serious. I only give it a 4 because of the gay theme they have put in the show.,Positive
"Warehouse 13 has been a favorite for four years. Next year it will be cancelled after an abbreviated season. At least they are giving us a wrap-up unlike Alphas, which just left us on a cliffhanger.The stories are imaginative, believable, with delightful well-acted characters, unique people, really appealing.",Positive
I would watch this one again....and probably will.  The pros and cons of drinking milk and the milk production industry left me further convinced that limiting dairy surely will not kill me but that swilling lots of milk could.,Positive
"This film opened and disappeared quickly in the DFW area, so I'm certainly glad I caught up to it via Blu ray.  A first time director (J Blakeson) puts together a taut thriller using only 3 actors and a minimalist set...not to mention a minimalist plot, albeit filled with twists and turns.  Alice, a 20 something lass is the daughter of a rich businessman somewhere in England.  She is kidnapped and taken to a well prepared (soundproofing, locks, etc.) apartment to wait for an eventual ransom.  Alice is played by Gemma Arterton whose previous credits include eye candy roles in ""The Prince of Persia"" and ""Clash of the Titans"".  She's something else here.The girl can act as well as look good.  In a demeaning, vulnerable role, she is stripped naked, force to pee in a bottle, tied to a bed and ruthlessly gagged with one of those ball-in-the-mouth things that sex dominatrix like to use.  It's fun to figure out what's going on because we suspect Alice is familiar with one of the kidnappers.  So really, what's going on? Yes, a big surprise. Even after we find this out, our questions aren't answered.  The film is filled with tension and is certainly an obscure gem of a picture.",Positive
"Here&#8217;s the thing about comedy: if you beg, borrow, or steal it, it usually isn&#8217;t as funny the second time around.  No matter how hard you try.  No matter how everyone involved tries.  It just won&#8217;t work the same way.  Ever have to explain a joke?  Ever notice how &#8211; in the process &#8211; everything remotely humorous about it gets sucked away with each passing word?  Same thing.  When you pilfer from the best, you&#8217;re at least playing solid odds that whatever audience shows up will give you only gracious laughs but not necessarily ones all that legitimately earned.Humor works best when it comes from an original inspiration.  When all you do is take bits and pieces from what others have done before you (especially when it comes to comedy), then you should be fully prepared to be called a &#8216;hack.&#8217;  You deserve it, after all, and so does everyone who shows up to help you out.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;A Russian space station crashes in Amsterdam, releasing a deadly virus that turns everyday citizens into flesh-craving psychopaths.  Aziz (Yahya Gaier), his brother Mo (Ouled Radi) and several strangers emerge from jail, oblivious to the mayhem until they team up with a local police officer (Gigi Ravelli).  After receiving a desperate call for help, this unlikely band of heroes sets out on an insane rescue mission &#8211; and it&#8217;s going to take a seriously crazy plan if they want to get out alive &#8230;&#8221;I&#8217;m a stickler for comedy, and, if you learned anything from what I wrote above, you know that I think it works best when it&#8217;s fresh, original, and timely.  That&#8217;s a mighty big success to achieve, and directors Martijn Smits and Erwin van den Eshof give it an affable try in a script that barely hints at anything original in it.  Sadly, we&#8217;ve seen these characters before (in much better films); and we&#8217;ve seen this set-up and situation all too often (again, in far superior outings).  If this represents the best they have in their arsenal of entertainment, then the Dutch might wanna leave zombie comedies to the rest of the world.Naturally, there are a few tweaks here that work quite well, so KILL isn&#8217;t a complete failure.  Amsterdam has never looked better!  A Cold War era Russky soldier gets some of the best one-liners in his five minutes of film!  Aziz&#8217;s &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217; turns out to be the official &#8216;Office Skank.&#8217;  At times, KILL musters a recognizable charm (that we&#8217;ve seen stronger elsewhere).  The problem is that it never mixes up its ingredients enough to force this mixture to congeal into the confection everyone involved probably thought it was going to be.For example, leading man Yahya Gaier seems all wrong here, so much so that he looks like he isn&#8217;t having all that much fun.  Likewise, his big screen brother (Radi) grins and goofs through his dialogue, though he never quite seems to tap into proper comic timing to make the best of the dire circumstances.  Dare I say, the only one who seems at home here is the fetching Ravelli &#8211; she dominates every scene she&#8217;s in the way a leading lady should &#8211; an actress who clearly understands what the script and directors wanted out of her and delivers in a big way.Too bad they couldn&#8217;t have used a few bucks from whatever budget they had to hire a decent continuity person, as the forever-changing blood stain patterns on Gigi&#8217;s clean white blouse gets downright irritating in the second half.Or was that a joke, too?KILL ZOMBIE! (2012) is produced by Launch Works and Talent United Film & TV.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by the stellar Well Go USA Entertainment.  For those folks needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Dutch spoken language release with English subtitles available.  As for the technical specifications, this is a very well-made release, and it dishes out some high quality sights and sounds (though a few effects sequences are pretty bad).  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then you&#8217;ll be sorely disappointed: there&#8217;s only a theatrical trailer to make your day.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  As charming as KILL ZOMBIE! is, it&#8217;s also quite obnoxious.  Unfortunately, the script by Tijs van Marle borrows only the best ideas of vastly superior films but never quite puts them to good use.  As a result, the story never metastasizes into anything so noble as those films it derives its narrative and situations from, practically sucking the life out of screwball moments that go on for too long.  Still, fanboys are likely to swoon over the unintentionally luscious Gigi Ravelli, the single-best Dutch treat ever to put on the police uniform.  Be warned: she&#8217;ll have you wishing for the Apocalypse in no time at all.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of KILL ZOMBIE! by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",Negative
"It is a very good show, enjoyed the acting, especially the 3 lead actors....only seen a couple episodes so far",Positive
Ready for season 2,Positive
"basically a dramatization of real events in London hospital in early 1900's.  as an ER doc myself right now, I see the similarities of the workings of an urban hospital among the poorest of the poor in the 1900's and how our &#34;modern&#34; ER's work today.  It is uncanny really how little we have learned about how to care for masses of poor folk.  The characters in this series are believable and historic yet are so well rendered as to be fascinating.",Positive
"Well, now I know what all the hype was about and why they are making a movie. Because the series was cancelled suddenly with NO ENDING!!! How dumb are these TV execs to cancel a show without allowing an ending? I must see the movie when it comes out so I know how it ends. Kudos to Kristen Bell and the guy who plays her dad (can't pronounce or spell his name) and all the friends and boyfriends. I hope we get to see all these characters again soon!",Positive
"LASERBLAST is a nearly plot-free sci-fi film about a man who finds an alien laser weapon, becomes possessed by it, and goes berserk. It's the perfect fodder for immolation by Mike and his silly sidekicks. LASERBLAST -like MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS, etc.-  is a schlock classic in its own right. As such, the unintentional humor tends to make the MST3K guys' job a lot easier! The jokes sort of write themselves!...",Positive
"I love the characters, the plot, and the story line.  It keeps you hanging by the edge of your seat.",Positive
"I am enjoying this more and more, however since I started late and watch it on Prime it doesn't lsat long enough.",Positive
"Interesting piece of film. Charlatanism, hedonism and counter culture &#34;hippie-ness&#34;. Again, if you are a 60's buff or want to see some of the more extreme incarnations of the counter culture, watch this film. It's kind of cool.",Positive
"I waited eagerly for this film to come out.  The book was fabulous on so many levels. It asked thought provoking questions about the relationship between men and women, women and women, and humans and animals and it even included questions for discussion at the end. Everything that was intriguing or thought provoking in the book is missing. What replaces it is are shots of Scarlett Johansson staring into space, with and without clothes. Seriously, that is a major part of the film. This film goes beyond slow to tedious. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the story I'd read would suddenly burst forth...it never happened. You might as well turn off the volume and treat it as an abstract art film.Perhaps the biggest initial turn-off was the choice of Johansson. In the book, Isserley was not a beautiful woman, having been (painfully) engineered to feature the large breasts that would cause men to leer at a plain girl with the thick glasses she required to see on earth. That fact made the culling of the hunky men she chose much more palatable. They were to a large extent the victim of their intentions to use someone. The objectification of women was a large part of the story. Isserley was also constantly reflecting on her environment. Her alien insights were intriguing, something not captured by the dull stares they were replaced with in the film.In the end, what takes the place of depth and story line is a very slow and repetitive movie interspersed with a bit of fancy CGI. A group of alien men on motorcycles occasionally zip around to clean up any details left behind by her abductions but that is as action oriented as it gets. Forget this one...I already have.",Negative
"We love Olivia, her family and her friends.  She's quite adventurous, creative, clever and funny.  100% enjoyable even watching for the tenth time.",Positive

I Love Lucy never gets old. I have been seeing episodes since I was a kid and even today they do make you laugh. The HD version is digitized superbly and while the aspect ratio is 4:3 the black & white nostalgic comedy in this series can entertain anyone who has love for Lucy. Five Stars!,Positive

"I was on my way to a storage auction one day and low and behold the gang from storage wars were there.  I prepared myself for battle, put my boots on, dragged out my cash and away my family went.  We went up against Barry, we threw down against Dave.  We watched Jarrod and Brandy steal lockers from me (Though I have yet to figure out why there is psychology here, I have 200 bucks, I bid 200 bucks.  I bid my max and stop)  At the end of the day I was exhausted - Filming usually lasts 4 to 5 hours and there are usually many lockers to check out.  When it was all said and done I have won, in my own little way, a bit of history.  I had outbid Barry on a locker and had a lot of fun.  This is a solid show, it is a lot of fun and you can be on it if you are in the area where they are shooting.  It is a good time and what you see on the show is pretty much how it is in real life.  These people are pretty cool and are there to make money, just like the rest of us people.  Check it out.  By the way, I am in the Stairway to Hemet episode with my son bidding against Dave and Jarrod on the last auction.",Positive
"What a really good first season. I decided to check things out due to the ratings and word of mouth and, for the most part, it lives up to expectations. It's really in a different universe altogether than the original movie (and book), except for the fact that the character's names that matter are the same and the hotel is just as worn down and creepy as it was in all the previous filmic tellings of Norman Bates's strange (to say the least) life.I absolutely love Vera Farmiga's performance as Norma. It's kind of genius and helps make everything fall into place. She's creepy and smothering and sympathetic all at the same time. I can see why she got the Emmy nod, and in my mind she totally earned it. The best/creepiest moments on the show are when she and Norman are interacting, and you see just how close (too close?) they are.And now it's time for the negatives. Why this show is so close to being great and yet in my mind I can't give it that honor. Yet. The show's Achilles heel is its portrayal of Norman Bates. Norman Bates, the original character, wasn't really all that creepy when he was talking to people. He just seemed very shy and nervous and came off, at first, as sort of a victim of circumstance. He was only creepy in certain situations that if you've seen the original movie you know exactly what I'm talking about. However, here, he seems creepy all the time, which betrays the essence of the character in a way. And I think that's mostly due to Freddie Highmore's performance.He's fine, but he can't nail the emotional complexity of the character. He goes from being creepy to extra creepy, never really showing a real shift in psyche, and when he claims he has blackouts I just don't buy it at all. Hopefully this improves or is at least addressed later on in the series in some way.But, for what it is now the show is really something. 8.5/10 (9 is great to me btw)",Positive
"I love watching Tim Roth, he is a great actor and he seems to become the part he's playing. I actually watched this when it was on tv and I rarely will watch anything more than once. this is worth a 2nd viewing.",Positive
"This series has a lot of potential -- but I think it's too &#34;cutsey&#34; about half the time.  Wish it was more serious rather than trying to be cute.  Leaves a lot to be desired as far as I'm concerned.  So if you are looking for something to occupy your viewing time, guess this does the trick.",Negative

"NBC's CHUCK is such a welcome surprise and one of the best and funniest TV shows I've seen in a while, something which normally is an omen for immediate cancellation (but, thankfully, NBC picked it up for the full season). CHUCK achieves that heady mix of humor, action, espionage, and even a dash of romance (or pining, to be more exact). And it'll have you rooting for the nerd hero Chuck Bartowski, the physically hapless but nonetheless invaluable new member of the U.S. secret agent fraternity. Whereas, before, Chuck was someone who for thrills lived life vicariously thru video games and films, he's all of a sudden forced to cope with experiencing the very intense real thing.Several SPOILERS follow.The 411 on the premise and plot: A rogue CIA agent, just before being killed, downloads a wealth of top secret government files into the brain of his old college roommate Chuck Bartowski, a seemingly disastrous choice at first blush. Chuck is a social misfit, a computer geek who toils at the Nerd Herd electronics department of the Buy More supermarket. His support system consists of his best bud Morgan, who's even more of a loser than Chuck, and Chuck's lovely, protective sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster), who is perpetually concerned for him and his lack of a social life. That Chuck lives with Ellie and her laid back boyfriend, Captain Awesome, doesn't exactly win him points with the cool set. But, for Chuck, things are about to change.Chuck meets Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), who seems to really like him. But Sarah is really a CIA agent sent to wrest the stolen intel from him. Finding out that the top secret data is imbedded in his noggin, she is then assigned to keep tabs on him. To do so, Sarah works at Wienerlicious and poses as Chuck's chica. Meanwhile, the NSA trots out its top operative, the no-nonsense John Casey (the awesome Adam Baldwin), who as cover hires on as a Buy More sales clerk.Nowadays, danger and intrigue lurk at every corner for Chuck Bartowski, who finds himself leading a double life and is now sometimes referred to as the Intersect (mostly by Casey). He speedily proves his value when the data in his brain enables him to put two and two together and uncover an assassination attempt. Soon, he's tangling with ninjas, shadowy agents, terrorists, and bombs - and that's just in the first episode. Further shows would unveil even greater peril and more mystery. Seeds of distrust are sown as Chuck also struggles with the constant hedging and fabrication brought on by his CIA and NSA minders. More importantly, despite obstacles put up by his nemesis, the evil Asian dude Harold Tang (okay, he's not really evil...but he's bald), Chuck's trying out for the assistant manager gig at the Buy More. Good luck, Chuck.End SPOILERS.CHUCK is a consistently funny, funny show doubling as a straight-up spy thriller. There are plenty of slick, potent action sequences, but the heart of the series is the comic fish-out-of-water premise of the geek caught in serious cloak-and-dagger environs. The show provides a steady dosage of nerd/slacker humor which always has me smiling for the duration of the episodes. And, instead of Chuck suddenly developing kung fu skills, the series makes sure that Chuck remains inept and a bit cowardly (Chuck would prefer to refer to it as being ""prudent""). Zachary Levi as Chuck is wonderfully straight-faced yet has that comic timing down pat. He's very sympathetic as a guy whose big heart is shyly on his sleeve.Which leads us to another focal point of the show: Chuck's tentative relationship with the beautiful Sarah, who as a spy is forever on her guard and who's still grieving over her recent past with a fellow agent. But there's a connection between her and our favorite Nerd Herder, as Sarah realizes that Chuck really is a most decent dude. But only time will tell if it pans out. Australian Yvonne Strahovski is well cast as the lethal and accomplished secret agent, who can kick enemy agent heinie even a she dances sensuously with a clueless partner (yes, that would be Chuck). Yet Strahovski, when called for, can lend a torn, vulnerable air to her calculating superspy (check out ""Chuck versus the Nemesis"" to see just how conflicted she becomes). And, holy ministrone, she's hot! On the other hand, I don't think the looming Adam Baldwin is hot, but he's one of my favorite dudes to watch on TV. Fans of Joss Whedon will remember Baldwin from his memorable recurring roles in ANGEL and FIREFLY. Here, he makes for an intimidating sales clerk and government spy.I am currently in solid geek heaven with CHUCK. Here's hoping NBC continues to support this show for a busload of seasons. Here's to Chuck (and friends) waging war against irate Buy More patrons, staving off calculating co-workers, and also fending off some of the most diabolical enemies of America, mom, and apple pie. And all that while shouldering the stigma of a dead-end job. Way to go, Chuck!",Positive
As I said in season 2's review; If you like guns & competition shows this is defiantly a show for you as well as seeing some of the most awesome weapons use through the years as well as new and improved.  This show seems to be finding it's own and getting better and better. I really enjoy this show,Positive
"The so-called animation for this series was interesting.  I guess it's been referred to as &#34;motion comic&#34; and that's certainly a much more applicable term.  Basically, there's very little movement/animation, so it's like reading or hearing a comic book, but with some minor animations.  Normally, that's not my cup of tea, but I've given this four stars because the writing of this series was good enough to keep me interested in this motion comic series.  I would, however, caution you to expect far more Loki than Thor, so the title is somewhat misleading.",Positive
"Very down home,Louisiana, Cajon...different in that it has no professional actors,raw police work,but I found it to try too hard to make the police work interesting...the place is depressing, looks very poverty stricken.never any beautiful scenes.after seeing this ,I would never want to visit the area..",Negative
"Love this show. There are a bunch of different people on the show,telling you and showing you how they make a living in the swamps of Louisiana.",Positive
"I watched Helen Mirren in every episode of this show when it first aired on BBC in the UK.  She was absolutely magnificent in the role.  I suspect how much you like this show will depend on whether you saw the original series starring Mirren. I can't say this is a terrible version of the series.  However, the whole thing turns on the lead actress and her desire to climb to the absolute top of the homicide heap.  I didn't think this actress had the same ability as Mirren with this character.I also wonder about such blatant sexism being practiced by the NYPD with the USA's EEO laws.  The entire first episode is a flagrant violation of those laws and we learn in seconds that this is just one series in a long episode of her cases being handed over to the men in the office.  The USA is so much more litigious than the Brits that I simply can't believe she isn't seeing a lawyer and shortly receiving  a hefty settlement along with any homicide case she wants to handle.",Negative
Just finished watching season 6 on DVD. (I live in Europe and it has been out a few weeks already) Dumbest ideas ever in 24. Fox should definetely fire the writers! There got to be more qualified people out there?Don`t buy it. Rather buy season 5 (which was great),Negative

"Martin (Cillian Murphy) and Kate (Thandie Newton) are a married couple who go off and live on an island. She had a stillborn and the day after she came out of the hospital her husband was at work. In her blog she has a secret of her own she can't tell Martin (one that isn't worth waiting for). The house is huge and they have plenty of food and even electricity from a finicky basement generator and Internet access. Kate is distant and aloof from the start as Martin is the more likeable of the characters.Kate retreats to the bath and doesn't allow her husband to see her naked, as she appears extremely disturbed, blaming Martin for everything. Then suddenly a man in military fatigues, sinisterly armed with a pistol shows up on the island and passes out from his head trauma. Jack (Jamie Bell) the injured man recovers and informs Martin there is a deadly airborne virus killing off the world's population and is headed ""our way."" He wants to seal up the house which is on a cold remote island.The couple doubts Jack's story but have no way to verify it or leave the island. They are prisoners in their own house in a slow developing home invasion film. Twist at the end makes the whole film a waste of time.F-bomb, no sex or nudity.",Negative
This is the type of show I enjoy watching.  You never knowwhat is going to happen next.  The clothes designer knewhow to show all of the actors to their best advantage.Romance and lots of problems.

Captures the attention of a 2 year old and covers so many different topics. Definitely a favorite in our house!,Positive
"Because we're no longer amazed by this show, responses have been pretty tepid this season.  But it's still the best thing on TV.  The trajectory of Don Draper is beautifully done, and, while increasingly somber (how nice that a character is treated seriously!), Mad Men never sacrifices wit or invention.",Positive

"Back in 2007 I was in Toronto and met some guys who screened Demons 2 one night.  Before the film began they showed a collection of film trailers for Argento films, spaghetti westerns and such, and then the original HOBO trailer played.  It was a wonderfully done trailer that rivaled the ones used in the Tarantino/Rodriguez Grindhouse film.  The director was present in the theater but I didn't speak to him then(too bad), but I always remembered the trailer.  I never thought it would actually become a feature film, let alone star Rutger Hauer.So here we are-Hobo With A Shotgun is a reality, and the exploitation world is the better for it.  Basically it's about a hobo that comes into a crime ridden town and decides to go Bronson when he's seen(and experienced) enough.  The town in the movie is super exaggerated in it's criminal activity-it's a friggin' warzone!  Think of the gang ruled neighborhood in Death Wish 3 and that's how this entire town is!  But then again, everything here is exaggerated.  This movie is very cartoony and brings to mind images of Troma(in fact, a character in the film is wearing a Troma shirt in one scene).  Rutger Hauer is the odd one out in that he's basically the ""normal"", non-cartoon character here.  And that really makes it work.  His downplaying against everyone else's over the top playing really helps give the movie that additional edge to bring it above being total silliness(along with the hot young lady who plays the prostitute.  I forgot her name at the moment).  We all love Hauer, you'd have to be some kind of communist not to.  Though he's been in numerous B movies throughout the years, we've never seen him in something quite like this, something more tongue in cheek.  Movies like Bleeders, Crossworlds and Turbulence 3-Heavy Metal were schlock, but schlock taking itself a bit more seriously.  It's a nice change of pace for Hauer.The film has a decent amount of gore.  Some say it surpasses Machete.  I'm not sure if it does.  Perhaps, but unlike Machete, the gore here is not CGI, which elevates it substantially.The second disc(if you're thinking of buying the 2 disc version) has a nice Making Of.. documentary, interviews with Hauer and director Eisener by Fangoria magazine, the alternate ending, and the original fake trailer(though this may be on disc one, I forgot).  I haven't watched the film on ""Shotgun Mode"" yet, so I'm not sure on that one.All in all, a very good ""grindhouse"" style film here.  Usually these modern throwback movies leave alot to be desired and make you wish you had used your time to watch an actual grindhouse movie instead of these weak imitations.Hobo With A Shotgun is one to be proud of the grindhouse throwback status.  It earns it.",Positive
WOW WHAT A TV SPECTACULAR.  GABRIEL IS THE SEXIEST MAN ON EARTH.  I WILL BUY THE NEXT SEASON.  DO NOT EVEN THINK OF CANCELLING THIS TV SERIES.  ALL OF THE CAST ARE SUPERIOR.

"You can't quite call this movie a suspense thriller, although there are certainly suspenseful scenes in it. What's that noise in the back of the medicine room? Who's there? Will he be caught?It's more of a quiet, intense character study. A young doctor becomes obsessed with one of his patients. When she is released from the hospital and seems likely to go flitting off with boyfriends, in social circles removed from him - he arranges to make her sick enough to have to come back to the hospital - to him. He does this in a sort of abstracted state of mind. We are never sure how far he really intends his sickening of the girl to go.But, for a while at least, he succeeds in making her his own, a saintly pallor of a girl transfixed on her hospital bed.This is a compelling, involving movie. It is brilliantly acted. Every character becomes starkly real on the screen - from the randy, self-seeking orderly - to the Doctor himself. If you like low-key malevolence, this is the movie for you.",Positive
"If they take out the swearing and sex, there would be no show - thin, thin story line. I would not watch another episode for FREE!",Negative
This special had it's high points and it's low points but Matt Smith was amazing all the way through. Not to mention the fantastic Ian McKellen added his amazing voice to yet another sci-fi franchise. Defiantly worth a watch for fans new and old.,Positive
"*SPOILERS!*This is my favorite Doctor Who season and the chemistry between the tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and Rose Tyler (played by Billie Piper) is outstanding.  I love watching them sing the theme to Ghostbusters, laugh together, and when Rose is possessed during a trip to the hospital, watching her throw herself at the Doctor for a kiss and he seems completely startled but as she walks off he mumbles  ""Yep, still got it.""  XD  David/Billie - you guys are awesome!Season 2 is a must for Doctor Who fans.",Positive
Season 2 is as good as season 1. This series is based on real cases and all this was before all the drugs we have around now.,Positive
"It's unfortunate that this worthwhile Irish film has nearly the same title as the currently popular Twilight Saga ""Eclipse"" series about vampires. It might get overlooked in the confusion of titles. This is all the more unfortunate because the title ""Eclipse"" doesn't seem particularly apt to the traces of ghostly influence here. The film could so easily and so much more accurately have been given some other title, something referring to the wedding gown train of lost love.Actually, this movie was based on a short story that was strictly about a widower's life in the wake of his wife's death from cancer. The short story had no ghostly elements at all. These were only added for the sake of boosting cinematic and box office appeal. And it shows. The brief appearances of actual ghosts here are often alarming, menacing, downright shocking, and so are at war with the general mood of this film. The film's essential theme is the possibility of finding another mature, tender love after one has suffered the loss of one's first partner in life. The occasional hair-raising intrusions of apparitions onto the scene are adventitious and unnecessary.The main intended sentiment of the film is beautifully conveyed by the actors. Ciaren Hinds plays his part of the widower with just the right combination of a numbness that closes him off from the world and a longing that opens him up to future possibilities.This is a rare adult love story, in which ""adult"" does NOT mean X-rated - but harkens back to an earlier, more essential meaning of the word ""adult."" Here the two adults express their maturity by being sane, stable individuals who put getting to fondly know each other first and foremost.",Positive

I at first thought the ladies and Abbie were cooking this up to get a name for themselves but lo and behold it continues to this day.  I wondered how the ladies could tolerate some of Abbie's methods and at the same time wondered how in the world could Abbie put up with such disrespect from the moms (i.e. &#34;You're a whore&#34; - quote from Kelly).

"Viewer be warned, for a legal drama there is really not much in the way of courtroom scenes. It has more to do with the legal process (deposition, finding witnesses, filing motions, etc.).I've been watching this on Netflix instant and was hooked from the first episode. It starts out as a CSI ""Who Dunnit"" approach, showing someone who was murdered followed by a random woman roaming the streets covered in blood. Each episode reveals a piece of the puzzle, until everything makes sense with the final episode and brings you up to speed. By the time you catch up, the season is over and you're amazed they were able to draw you in for so many episodes. And, you want more!The cast is amazing with some heavy hitters. Ted Danson stars as Mr. Frobisher, a multimillionaire businessman who will stop at nothing to keep his money safe. Glenn Close plays Pattie Hughes, a rough and tumble lawyer who has many, many sides to her. Trying to figure her out is darn near impossible. She adapts to anything thrown at her and seems to be one step ahead at almost all times. The second season features Mario Peebles, Timothy Olyphant, William Hurt, and Marcia Gray Harden. There are others I'm sure, I simply do not recognize them.All in all, great series that keeps you captivated and entertained. Watch an episode and see for yourself!",Positive
Interesting take on Sherlock.  Love Watson!!  Not sure about Sherlock he's just a bit too disordered. Again watch it for Watson,Positive
"I watched the first episode not knowing that Gary Trudeau, the creator of Doonesbury, was behind it. The humor is certainly recognizable and with a great cast of characters played by great comedic actors. I'm hooked, looking forward to more!",Positive
"The people who were involved with this film put together a nice little magical trip into humanity. I see some reviewers pigeonhole this film as a family film. Personally, I think it is a film for everyone. I usually enjoy a good comedy, science fiction, drama, or suspense journey in a movie. This film is none of the above.I have toyed with watching this movie for quite some time. Finally, the names Rob Reiner and Morgan Freeman yanked me into this magical opus. I do respect both men's abilities.I think John Lennon's words best sum up this movie...""Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans.""As for the neighborhood portrayed in this film, I wouldn't mind living there.Road Trip",Positive

"Can't wait till I can get the next season! Love this show about friends from LA that move to Cleveland and the hilarious adventures. I'm around the same age as these women (not as beautiful) but can relate to some of their insecurities. Betty white character is a bonus! She is a hip, funny woman who brings the other four back to reality. This series is a must if you love slapstick comedies.",Positive
"Better Off Ted is outrageously funny. Great acting, witty banter, crazy ideas, and not-too-far-fetched corporate scenarios make this a very entertaining series to watch.",Positive

"This is a first: An unusual number of five star ratings at a rate that surpasses all of this past years Academy Award (Oscars) nominated movies put together (TOTAL). Also, interesting is that the same fanatic slasher types are hacking the heads off of any one who dares give it one star (or less). Depending on date the same reviewers gave the one star reviews a: 0 out of 25; 0 out of 14; 0 out of 13; 0 out of  12, 0 out of 11. I'm just happy they're not all from Salem.The reason: A large number of people are making sure their Kickstarter funding for this movie proves rewarding.The movie: Simplistic dialogue that could only come from a cliche saturated Hollywood high school apprentice writer. Acting so bad the actors could manage only one short emotionless line then pause for the next actor to robotically respond in kind; back and tediously back and forth. Scenes composed of  95% dumbed down dialogue. Other 5% of scenes composed of a superficial attempt to  appear current e.g. tablets, internet video, Samsung product placement phones. Lot of formula characters e.g. dumb act cool cops; surfer dude; party people; lawyer cutouts; etc.Baddd: How bad? I was ff after 10 minutes and checking it every 10 to see if anything changed. Answer - as blandly homogenized as milk.People! For the honest reviewers not financially invested in this movie; if you want to see quality acting, storyline, sets, props and actually have to think, then watch ""The Best Offer"". It may cleanse you of the effects of this film's shallow banality. As far as the ""fanatic-obsessives"" I hope that VM series wasn't a representation of lives (un)productively lived. Let me know.",Negative
This show is always entertaining and suspenseful.  The ingredients in the baskets are so random....I am always amazed what talented chefs can make of of them.,Positive
So many twists and turns to this story. I cant wait to see the ending! Very tastefully done. Good development of characters. We were not sure we would like it. But we do!!!!,Positive
Not a bad banana in the bunch... this is a fantastic show and excellent actors doing a magnificent job... Entertainment at it's best!,Positive
"Just when you think there can't possibly be amy more twists, three more show up!  Very exciting and the characters are wonderful.  One of my very favorites.",Positive
"I remember seeing this show on PBS as a child. I became interested in watching it after seeing Downton Abbey. I really liked the first season of the series. I watched it in a marathon over a cold winter weekend. The second season kept my interest and I watched it over another winter weekend. It is still interesting but not as much as the first two seasons. I didn't like some of the character changes and some of the original character such as Hudson & James Bellamy became a bit irritating to me. If you liked seasons #1, #2 & Downton Abbey, give it a watch.",Positive
Riveting. Wish there'd been a second season but glad for the ending. One of the most satisfying single season shows ever.,Positive
"At the time of this review, ""Dracula"" has not yet been commissioned for a second season, and opinions are evenly divided on whether or not it'll get one. Composed of ten episodes, there's very little here that resemblesBram Stoker's novel(beyond the names of the characters), and much that has been borrowed from Francis Ford Coppola's take on the story inhis 1992 film.Not that this is a bad thing. Although there's nothing out there that I'd call the ""definitive"" adaptation of Dracula, neither do I insist on absolute fidelity to source material,  especially with material that's as well-trod as the Dracula mythos (not to mention the recent resurgence of the vampire genre). As long as what I'm watching is fresh and interesting, I'm game for any reimagining. So what is it that creators Cole Haddon and Daniel Knauf bring to the table?This take on Dracula is a mixed bag of intriguing ideas and wasted potential, in which the titular vampire is wakened from a centuries-long slumber by Abraham van Helsing, seeking to use him as an unlikely ally in his war against the powerful Order of the Dragon.  Posing as an American industrialist called Alexander Grayson, Dracula arrives in London in the year 1896, eager to revenge himself on the sect responsible for murdering his wife and cursing him with immortality.Pros:The general premise -Although I'm still awaiting an adaptation of Dracula that is 100% faithful to Bram Stoker's original novel (the BBC miniserieshas probably come the closest), I like that this show isn't afraid to march way off the beaten track and present what is pretty much an entirely original story with a few familiar faces.Here Mina Murray is not a teacher but a medical student, Jonathan Harker not a lawyer but a journalist, Renfield no longer a sycophantic slave but Dracula's trusted manservant. Lucy Westenra is (still) a socialite but with a secret regarding her sexuality, and Abraham van Helsing is a barely-hinged professor who tenuously holds the reins when it comes to controlling Dracula's bloodthirsty urges. Though there's no sign of Arthur Holmwood or Doctor Seward, newcomer Lady Jane Wetherby picks up the vampire-slaying slack as an aristocratic noble-women who moonlights as a vampire hunter.Though Bram Stoker was inspired by the historical Vlad &#538;epe&#537; in his creation of Dracula, this adaptation makes the link between the two figures explicit, rendering Vlad and Dracula one and the same. And though Francis Ford Coppola was not the first film-maker to forge a romantic bond between Dracula/Mina, he certainly popularized the notion, and the conceit is carried on here by portraying Mina as Dracula's reincarnated wife Ilona - which naturally throws a spanner in van Helsing's carefully formulated plans.The production values -Make no mistake; this show is a feast for the eyes. From the set design (opulent ballrooms, candle-lit restaurants, gleaming solariums) to the costumes (the sumptuous ball gowns, glittering jewelry, Mina's array of cute little hats) to the elegant cinematography and soundtrack, everything about ""Dracula"" is stunningly beautiful. The world that they've created bears little resemblance to what Victorian London would have *actually* looked like, for there are anachronisms everywhere, but it has a unique style all its own, with a dash of steampunk and a glossy sheen.Performances -Forgive the pun, but all the cast sink their teeth in their roles with great enthusiasm. Jonathan Rhys Meyer seethes with his trademark intensity, but other standouts include Nonso Anozie as the efficient Renfield and Katie McGrath, who breaks away from her usual bad-girl role (as seen inMerlin) to paint Lucy as a rather tragic figure in unrequited love with her best friend.Jessica de Gouw is certainly very beautiful as Mina Murray, though after a few episodes focusing on her medical career, she's reduced to bride-to-be, damsel-in-distress and object of male affection, and Thomas Kretschmann is sadly underused as an otherwise riveting van Helsing. Peppered throughout the supporting cast are a number of familiar British actors: Andrew Lee Potts, Robert Bathurst, Jemma Redgrave and Neve McIntosh to name a few. Their names may not ring any immediate bells, but if you're a fan of BBC television I guarantee you'll recognize them.Cons:The storyline -Basically, this is the cast ofDraculain the plot ofThe Count of Monte Cristo, which is no bad thing save that one crucial element is missing: a reason to care. When Edmond Dantes is unjustly sent to the Chteau d'If for crimes he didn't commit, the audience is on the edge of their seat in anticipation for him to unleash retribution on those that framed him.Yet the alliance of Dracula/van Helsing versus the Order of the Dragon has no resonance to it simply because we have no firm understanding of why the vendetta exists in the first place. We're given a few flashbacks that depict each man's family being brutally murdered, but as to WHY the Order decided to inflict such punishment goes completely unexplained. Not helping is the fact that Dracula and van Helsing's respective families are complete cyphers, devoid of any personalities, whose deaths are a tragedy only because the show tells us it is.Also unsatisfying is the way both men go about wrecking vengeance. After a certain point you begin to wonder why van Helsing even resurrected Dracula in the first place - he leaves a trail of dead bodies in his wake, he refuses to follow the plan, and he usually ends up being more trouble than he's worth. You'd think that Dracula's involvement would at least have been justified by van Helsing's need for someone to inflict brutal violence on their mutual enemies, but not only does it turn out that van Helsing is more than capable of committing murder all on his own, but his plan revolves almost entirely around ""Alexander Grayson"" introducing geomagnetic technology to the masses as part of a ploy to undermine the Order's power by threatening their monopoly on foreign oil supply.Why'd he need Dracula for that? Surely there were others he could have called upon to impersonate an American businessman, and it's all ultimately negated when Helsing goes ahead and takes revenge on his mortal foe without Dracula's involvement at all.Damn love triangles -Is anyone else sick to death of these things? It seems that there isn't a single film, show or book these days that doesn't consider itself complete unless there are characters vying for each other's affection, often in childish and inexplicable ways. ""Dracula"" does one better and introduces what's best described as a love dohecahedron. Jonathan loves Mina, who is the reincarnated wife of Dracula, who finds herself drawn to Alexander Grayson, who is busy seducing Lady Jane, who notices that Lucy is also in love with Mina, who encourages her to express her feelings as part of a roundabout plot to drive a wedge between Alexander and Mina after noticing their mutual attraction, who goes ahead with confessing her love to Mina, who when rebuffed, then sleeps with Jonathan in order to get back at Mina... oy.All these love triangle shenanigans take up a LOT of screen-time and very little of it makes sense. Furthermore, the show ultimately presents Mina/Dracula as the ""official couple"", even though we're given very little reason to care about them. The actors don't have a huge amount of chemistry, the characters don't spend a lot of time together, and to simply state that Mina is the reincarnation of Dracula's wife is an incredibly lazy way of insisting to the audience that their attraction to one another is ""true love.""In a show that has a vampire as its lead character, there's disappointingly very little vampirism in the show itself. Far too much screen-time is spend on these tedious intrigues, and they have very little purpose beyond getting people to lash out at each other in increasingly erratic ways.Inconsistencies -Yeah, there are quite a few of these, and most of them are pretty glaring. I've already mentioned the ultimate pointlessness of van Helsing's reliance on Dracula, but so many components of the storyline make very little sense. Why can't Jane, an accomplished vampire-hunter, tell that the man she's sleeping with doesn't have a pulse? Why would Lord Davenport, searching for Grayson's weakness, deduce that he's in love with Mina Murray based on his possession of a five hundred year old painting that depicts a woman who looks a little like her?Why doesn't Harker check his sources before publishing a devastating article accusing a man of treason? Having pretty clearly established Lucy as a virgin, why does she later look like she knows exactly what she's doing in the bedroom? Why on earth would the Order ""punish"" Dracula by turning him into an immortal vampire that could potentially threaten all their lives?We learn at one point that vampires are being drawn to London thanks to Dracula's presence there. But why are they gathering? Is he doing it on purpose? Does he even know about it?Other plot-points are raised only to be completely ignored. At one point Mina injects a dead rat with vampire blood and packs it away again before she notices its leg twitching. It's never brought up again. At another point Dracula investigates Jane's house, finds a female vampire locked up in her basement, tearfully kisses her hand and then returns to bed. And... that's it. Nothing more ever comes of it.Conclusion:""Dracula"" is a glossy and stylish reinvention of the character that is not without merit - just without direction. I remain somewhat confused as to whether we're supposed to view this particular Dracula as an anti-hero or an out-and-out villain, and the dwindling likeability of all the other characters means that my investment in them faded as the episodes went on.Whether the show will get a second season remains to be seen, though as the bloodbath in the final episode kills off most of its best characters, there's a chance that even if it does come back, a significant portion of its audience may not.",Negative

"With the exception of South Park and the Simpsons, this is the best comedy on TV.  In a world bound by PC and 'standards and practices', it's about the best it can be.  Ms. White is a timeless source of unexpected humor.  You know she's part of the cast, reading a script; yet, her quips come as a surprise.  We just can't accept that older people have a sense of humor and an agile mind.The composite cast is perfect, with Wendy Malick, Valerie Bertineeli, and Jane Leeves as three friends who are constantly at each other's throats...but in a mild, harmless, PC way.The first season was very short but had no filler or bad shows.  If you've seen the series, you understand and will buy this.  If you HAVEN'T seen the show, then sample an episode.  I'm sure that you will want this collection after a taste of the series.",Positive
"I suspect that when they cast Piper Perabo in this role they knew her appeal would salvage some listless story lines. Her placement in each scene is a bit too intentional, perhaps they rely too much on Piper. The show is a bit contrived and 'too sexy' for it's own good.",Negative
This show is gritty and real and i like that. If you dont like blood and gore you wont like this show.,Positive
"This is an amazing concept. Classes have been taught on reading body language, I sure would enjoy a class on reading faces",Positive
"Exceptional thrillers have a great way of taking control of an audience's ability to generate its own adrenaline and then hit the gas pedal.  The Fox TV series ""24"" did this to very solid acclaim through most of its run on the small screen, and films like DIE HARD and even the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy make use of the popular `race against time' formula.  The ticking clock scenario also presents actors with a unique challenge to take the viewers along with them for the wild ride, knowing that every second counts when any timepiece is winding down to `zero.'For all of its merits (and there are plenty, including a solid central performance by Stephen Dorff), BRAKE comes off as more than just a bit convoluted.  The story?  Jeremy Raines (Dorff), a secret service agent, wakes up trapped inside a sealed glass box located inside the trunk of a vehicle.  He has absolutely no idea of how he got there - the script only provides a few hints as to his activities beyond the events of this film (sorry, folks, but I found that a BIG weakness).  However, the box is outfitted with a few attachments - an LED clock counting down, an air supply, a cell-phone-type device, an old CB radio - and he's soon informed by his captors that unless he'll divulge the physical address of `Roulette' that they'll kill him and his young wife.  What is `Roulette'?  It's the bunker location that would hold the President of the United States (POTUS) and the Vice-President in the event of a terrorist attack.  Raines spends the next hour trapped inside the box while being subjected to all kinds of torture, all the while trying to make contact with the outside world to let them know that he's been caught and being held by suspected terrorists.It's a suspenseful tale that works as a thriller mostly because of Dorff's work.  In fact, most of the problems involve a script that lacks any real narrative center.  (It's difficult to discuss without spoiling the surprise ending, so I'll have to leave it at that.)  Suffice it to say that, as an agent, Dorff uses his smarts to try to affect an escape ... but he never uses his smarts well enough to deduce what's really going on here.  Part of that is because of the story taking place in the outside world - he's led to believe that there's a series of smaller attacks unfolding against Washington DC - but, were that the case, why weren't all of the folks he contacts through the CB radio equally as concerned?  There are a few other creative missteps that involve Raines' unique medical condition - certainly if the terrorists knew as much as they suggest they know about the agent's background - why would they have chosen one unique form of torture (you'll have to watch it to understand that point)?Still, BRAKE works as a thriller, and I tend to give it a pass on that level alone.  There's a nice dabbling of conspiracy backed with some interesting political developments in there to keep an audience's interest.  While it may not succeed on every level, it certainly presents a viscerally claustrophic thrill-ride so long as you can endure it for 90 minutes.  It was fun to see how it all worked (or tried to work), and, despite a few flawed choices in the script, it delivers enough entertainment to be a solid guilty pleasure.  I'll probably never spin it in the DVD player again, but, as a one-off flick?  I had enough fun with it to give it a confident three stars.BRAKE was produced by Walking West Entertainment and Costa Productions, La.  DVD distribution is being handled through the MPI Media Group.  The disc looks and sounds exceptional; pay particularly close attention to the skillful layering of the audio track as some of the hints/clues that are dropped happen so quickly they might escape your attention.  The disc comes with a making-of featurette, a music video, and the theatrical trailer (though I'd encourage you to NOT watch the trailer before you watch the motion picture IF you prefer your films completely unspoiled as there are a few spoilers in there for the whiz-bang twist of an ending).  It's an affable collection, nothing great, for a film that'll have limited audience appeal.RECOMMENDED.  While it may not enter the history books as the greatest film ever, BRAKE works as a serviceable thriller for a post-9/11 world.  Sure, some parts of it may seem very far-fetched, but, like any good episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, it's the type of film that you'll watch differently if you spin it again.  Maybe a second or third time through you'll catch a few scenes that slipped by completely unnoticed the first time, if you're so inclined to give it another pass.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at IFC Films and MPI Home Video provided me with a DVD screener copy of BRAKE by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",Negative
"Everything is in place for an amazing action/fantasy series:  Joss Whedon co-creator/co-exec. producer, David Boyd (also from Firefly) cinematography, Bear McCreary (The Walking Dead) composer, ABC/Marvel/Disney providing the backing of what is obviously a budget unrivalled by the majority of prime-time television, a very attractive cast with special emphasis on gorgeous Chloe Bennet (Sky) and the wonderful chemistry between the scientists Fitz & Simmons, a cameo by Samuel L. Jackson on the second episode portending great things to come...It's immediately apparent that this S.H.I.E.L.D. team (although including two adept fighters) relies more on their wits and strategy than super-powers which causes the episodes to resemble the classic ""Mission Impossible"" series more than ""The Avengers"" film.  Also, I suspect that Marvel picked up on the fact that many of us fans became attached to Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) from his first appearance in ""Iron Man"" and when we saw him go down in Avengers we honestly felt the loss; however creating a weekly television series with him as the main star seemed a little risky but oh my gosh, was I ever pleasantly surprised.  Beneath his polished exterior of stoic professionalism resides a heart of legitimate compassion, as demonstrated in the very first episode, combined with fierce determination despite his apparent lack of outstanding physical prowess (unless you consider cool-headedness in the face of just about any threat a super-power) but somehow this character and the actor playing him were and remain the primary hook for me.Honestly, this show looks more like something made by Spielberg which just adds to its overall larger than life feel and frankly I'm amazed and thrilled at the renaissance of creativity and pageantry television is beginning to see after a very long Dark Age of reality TV.  :o)",Positive
The show looks like it could be a good drama and a solid comedy.  I am looking forward to more episodes.,Positive

The design and SOME of the story elements are really cool. I love the reconfigured relationship dynamic of Alfred and Bruce. But the main drawback are the villains.

"This series is the sequel to the animated series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender.""  You can understand this series well enough without having seen ""Avatar"" first.  In this fantasy world, certain people have magical control over one of the four elements of Earth, Air, Fire, or Water.  The world was split into four kingdoms:  Firebenders rule the Fire Nation, Waterbenders rule the Water Nation, and so on.  In the previous series, the Fire Nation attempted to take over the world, but Aang, the last Airbender, stopped them.  Only one person can control all four elements - this is the Avatar who, upon death, reincarnates yet again as the Avatar.Teenage Korra is the new Avatar.  Since the Fire Nation was defeated, there has been peace.  Technology has advanced to around the 1920's of our world, with electricity, automobiles, blimps, biplanes, radios, and so forth (dieselpunk.)  Korra has already mastered three of the elements but ironically can't airbend at all.  She wants to learn from Aang's son Tenzin, who eventually agrees to teach her.  A new threat is arising - the Equalists, led by a masked man calling himself Amon, who has the ability to take away people's bending powers.  Can Korra learn how to airbend, fully become the Avatar, defeat Amon, and figure out which young man she likes?  Watch and see.Does anime have to be made in Japan?  I don't think so.  This is one of the better anime out there.  It's more intense than ""Avatar,"" which was aimed more at younger viewers.  The animation quality of ""Korra"" is better, and the CGI and cell drawings merge well.  The voice acting is mostly pretty good.",Positive

"It's REMASTERED. Of course it's reissued as series 6. 4 Poirots. Previously aired/released episodes, but now with better picture.

David Suchet made Poirot famous. Philip Jackson plays Chief Inspector Japp in 2 episodes. Hastings (Hugh Fraser) Poirot's right-hand arrives in two episodes. Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) is back for one episode.I've never been disappointed with Poirot. Agatha Christie stories always fantastic, but Suchet makes adaptations soar to new heights. Humor, scenic bliss, and costumes rival script brilliance. It's tough cutting books to 100 TV minutes. This series does it well.

This series continues to be intriguing. A glimpse into the personal hells of characters circled within the ripples of a young woman's murder. Just when things become obvious the focus eclipses.

"From a technical point of view, this is one of the better ""found footage"" films to date. It uses various cameras from various locations and quality. Donna ""my pants are too tight"" Thompson (Kether Donohue) is reporting, and not too well, on the July 4th activities in the bay town of Claridge, Md. Everything is fun and games until people start to blister and die.The film is told as a bad documentary by design. It managed to hold my interest for 45 minutes at which point I started to get bored, even with the material they weren't repeating. The film utilizes real facts about Chesapeake Bay and isopods as well as actual footage of the creatures which you think are fake.The idea was to draw attention to the problem of the bay because no one watched the Frontline documentary on poisoned waters and even fewer people cared (from director's interview). The problem is that the terror created by isopods didn't come across as terrifying as I found my self concentrating Donohue's tight pants trying to will a button to pop.I enjoyed the realism more in this film than the ""Paranormal"" series. I also liked the idea of bringing a message to the film. Now if we could take the next step and make it entertaining. This could be done with a witty soundtrack and/or clever dialouge. Maybe having Trey Parker/Matt Stone smoking a joint saying, ""Dudes they're isopods, not Crab People.""Parental Guide: F-bombs (spoken and text). No sex or nudity. Tight pants that the button never pops.",Negative
"I had never seen it from the beginning, so watching alll 7 seasons was a real treat!!! Helped pass all the snowy winters we have in northern Micigan....thanks Prime Video",Positive
"This show is a mix between Workaholics and Bad Education.  I liked it very much and would watch this every week.  It started off a little slow but picked up and became quite funny.  I really liked the old sleepy, creepy, lady in the teacher lounge.",Positive
I love the original Australian show Rake and I was prepared to be disappointed with the American remake.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Greg Kinnear is brilliant in this version.  It is almost as good as the original and MUCH better than 99% of the garbage infesting television these days.,Positive
"This is an enjoyable show with good eye candy (male and female).  If you think about the show, you will ruin the entertainment value!!!  This show is to watch and enjoy, not think a dissect.  I find the main male leads having a good working relationship that you can believe, and you want to see continue into something more interesting.  The concept is far-fetched but entertaining.  Season two on the other hand, you just want sit the ""non-lawyer"" down and tell him to knock of the mellow dramatic persona!If your looking for a show that will keep you entertained and relax too, Suits is your show!",Positive
I watched this once out of boredom and felt only slightly less bored when I was done. Haven't seen it enough to get a feel for the actors.,Positive
Hammers every suspect as if they're guilty. Does he ever go back and apologize to all of the people he insulted who were innocent?Perfect example of cops and why we all hate them.,Negative
"it was an interesting story about an alien invasion, most of them are bad, but some turned out to have a heart and help. Over the top shooting and killing though...",Positive
"I'm not a big fan of the &#34;strangers thrown together under mysterious circumstances&#34; show. With the exception of Lost most of them are just tedious(see The Nine, Drive, The Langoliers). This show, unfortunately, falls in the tedious camp.A group of &#34;random&#34; people including a French actress(?), a clown, a kvetchy rich woman, a tough hispanic female cop and the angry brother from Heroes are trapped in a building when apparently Godzilla or something has destroyed LA. For some reason once they get out they all go to the rich ladies house to play her Wii Universe or something. Somehow they all find out that they were born on the same date and then.... Yeah I know enough already. I don't care either.This is easily the weakest of this years Pilot Season with clunky writing and direction and uninteresting characters.",Negative
"I LOVE this show. Wish I could just take off and trap and hunt like Marty, and be like Rich or Dave and be away from annoying people. Rock",Positive
It was interesting; fairly typical of this type of show but enjoyable.  I liked that the story was told by the people involved.,Positive
About life after nuclear war.  Amazon needs to get rest of series doesn't have it all.  I highly recommend. It.,Positive
"The cocaine high gun toting monkey was gratuitous but admittedly, funny...as was the character that was his owner. The General Manager and the Owner characters were very good as was the acting, sharp, not overly witty - well balanced, after all this is a comedy and not a drama. I would like to see a few more episodes, the show does not pander nor is it a drone like some of the other new pilots. It opens many new plot opportunities (would like to know what happens to the poor monkey...just kidding), is not too serious and remembers that it is a comedy. True, a woman fighting for recognition in a mans world is not new, but somehow the show seems refreshing.",Positive
We like this show a lot.  It is one of the few that my daughter can watch with me (as long as I check the subject first.  One in  the first season was a little too adult for her.),Positive
"This movie was less SciFi and more Zombie on Mars.  Don't get me wrong I like zombie movies, but I had hoped for a sci-fi thriller contagion kind of thing.  This was extremely predictable.",Negative
Great actors and good cinematography.  Horrible plot line and stupid characters.  The writers need to be more creative than dropping the F word to fill up the time.  It made the actors seem like stutters with Tourette Syndrome.  If at all possible avoid this show.  There are better apocalyptic shows to spend your time on.,Negative
"I abandoned watching this. I tried. As soon as the young girl cozied up to the John Krasinski character, I gave it up. It wasn't  going anywhere to begin with and now it was just trash.",Negative
"Great series, great cast.  My daughter got me hooked on this and I really enjoy it.  Can't wait for season 4.",Positive
I have always been a fan of this show.  I was so happy to see it on the Kindle.  The picture and sound quality are excellent and I thoroughly enjoy watching it.,Positive
"This is a refreshing, witty pilot that deserves a season. The characters make you want to know more about them especially the oboist, and the conductor.  Great that it's set in NYC. Really want to see more!",Positive
"This was very well written and acted.  It took elements of he Governor's character from Robert Kirkmans' Book, The Rise Of the Governor.  I know most people are all about the killing of the zombies and ALL about Daryl and Rick but this was a very important episode for the story line.  It is not all about zombies (don't get me wrong I do love my Daryl zombie kills) but its mainly the human interaction/survival/morals and survival during the dark times of this pandemic.Loved the episode and also if you have not read the 3 novels of the Governor by Robert Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga please do so they are an amazing and entertaining read.",Positive
"Vera Farmiga does a great job making you think she's a crazy manipulative woman for whom you are also sympathetic to.  Freddie Highmore as Normal Bates is great.  You like him a lot in the beginning but you know you are slowly building up to him becoming, well, psycho.",Positive
"Love the characters and the story! I have never been a football fan but this is making me like the people, which may be a start...",Positive
This series had a great first season.  They seemed to lose focus the second season but it is still very entertaining and way ahead of many other offerings.,Positive
"I would rate all the episodes in this series 4 stars, simply because the entire show is excellent.  Story lines, actors, actresses and whomever and whatever else is involved is great.  It is an up and down type of excitement which keeps you there.  You think that the rest of the show will be no good at one point and 2 minutes later it comes back and gets you and keeps you there.  It has done that for each episode so far that I have purchased.  I am not and probably won't be disappointed.  This show is great.",Positive
"My wife and I enjoy this season immensely. I try not to make a habit of watching often but as I overhear the plots twisting and turning, it is impossible not to be drawn into the life, loves and career of this very special agent with a heart.The scenery, the props and locations are superb as no expense has been spared in this high-budget thriller. The actors are fabulous and well-suited to their roles.We find that some episodes are slower than others but they all remain pertinent to the progression of the story and we find that the production, writing and directing of this season remain excellent. Together this team of story-tellers has brought forth another winner...enjoy",Positive
I like Morgan Freeman films.  Thought wasnt sure on this one.  Mom wanted to watch it turned on very good movie.,Positive
"This TV show moves so fast and furiously that you have no choice but to stayed glued even during the commercials, otherwise you're liable to miss a twist, a lie, a confrontation, managing chaos is exhausting and the show can leave you breathless by it's conclusion.",Positive
Another great season. Loved the Biden cameo. The season seemed a little less focused than other seasons but still very enjoyable. Finished the whole season in a hurry!,Positive
"will probably not watch it unless they to tone down the &#34;F&#34; words, i suspect they won't so it will be just another piece of trash",Negative
"Survivor season 28 is interesting in that there are a few new twists inserted, not the least of which is a hidden immunity neckless which can be used after a tribal vote is read. This makes it much more powerful than the type which must be used before the votes are read.",Positive
Season 3 started with a Roar....just like a good movie....and that went on for afew episodes...till drama got in the way....crying babies and more drama that wedid'nt really need.... i dont mind knowing a bit of the crew's relationships butthis season they waste a lot of episodes on this crap. And if you are smart youcan see where this serie is going and how it possibly gonna end.So ..yep lots of great single episodes that gives Science Fiction a big boost butwe known that drama and Religion will eventually take over.So ..at this point...im only looking at the good episodes and i am fast fowardingthe social drama parts that are making me fall asleep.But by the end of this season....things once again are getting interesting...very interesting...and cant wait to watch season 4.,Positive
The story was interesting but effects and budget where low by BBC standards.  It was nice that it's all wrapped up in just 6 episodes.,Negative
"If you've never seen ""Castle"" and are wondering if you'll enjoy it, THIS episode is a classic so it'd be a very good place to start.My husband and I have been devoted fans of the show ever since it first aired.  We love it so much we have made Monday night into our special ""date night"" every week.  Funny, warm, exciting and intriguing, yes, but more, two lead characters we both fell in love with.The writing - especially the story arc - is, in our humble opinion, the ongoing creation of one of the most beloved fictional couples from any genre - or in any series in TV history!",Positive
"The show was good, sometimes a little grafic but understand that is art if the show. I would tell others to watch the she because it is good and tofgorm their own opinion.",Positive
"This show is zoo much kick butt fun to watch. Oliver's dry stiffness is an excellent mix for his sweet, smart assistant Felicity Snow...Best super hero to be on television in a long time!!!!! Go Oliver and Felicity.",Positive
My children enjoyed this movie; they played it over and over. They even learned the songs and danced to the music.,Positive
"Particularly the Christmas Carol, Quite possibly the most spectacular episode of the entire series. Definitely worth watching just for that.t",Positive
"Sure hope it knows where it's going.  Starting to bet a bit convoluted.  I'm loving the main characters, enjoying the concept, and their acting is pretty solid.  Just hope the writers don't ruin it by injecting too many more  new, cool, twisted, surprising turns that thrill the writers, but causes us viewers to lose sight of the solid good story being told, and that will lose us viewers when we give up on it.  Stay on target... a target we can keep our minds around!!",Positive
I love the show.. But they need to get the medical part going again....I have prime.. But I see you must pay for this also....About time to drop prime...,Positive
"This British indy film had received a lot of attentions and favorable reviews, mainly from British film media.The film has a simple story about 2 semi-professional(?) contractors received orders with a ""kill list"".The first 3 acts are alright with a good cast but the last act is too slight to make it a good and satisfyingthriller and doesn't justify the foregoing grisly violence.",Negative
"I thought this seasons were as good as the other seasons. It's because there was just so much drama with Josh and Jake that over shadow the show. Damn brads didn't understand the way how bad fishing works. When there's good fishing you can just grab the crab and go. When there's bad fishing, you have to wait it out and find where the crab is. Those two didn't get that idea and just turned tail and ran away during king crab season.The wizard had bad fishing in crab season too, but did they run away from it? No, they stayed and looked for the crab until they found it. Also by doing so, they came in with high numbers too. It's just basics. Can't find the crab? Stay until you find it somewhere else. It ain't rocket science.The other boats were as usually. Had there little fights here and there but find the crab. There are two new boats shown in this seasons. Probably the only other big thing to talk about was that Edger from the NorthWestern left the boat after king crab season. I hope he comes back some day.",Positive
Couldn't even finish &#34;Sky City&#34; - it just feels like a sales pitch. Just get to the extreme engineering people.,Negative
"Agatha C. has done it again with another fantastic season.  Don't miss a minute of it, you will love it.",Positive
"I Love Lucy is classic funny, unlike today show. Too bad they don't havr all the episodes. I really like the episode where she does the vitameatvegamin girl and where she offer to be in the italian movie, you know what happens:)",Positive
The movie was okay but it dragged in places.  The ending was a little disappointing and left the viewer hanging.,Negative
"This series just keeps getting better. The characters are so well drawn and acted that they grab you and drag you along with them on their adventures. And even the most despicable character is so human that you understand, if not agree with, their motivation for their action.",Positive
"Though sad to see the Bow Tie gone, this was a thoroughly enjoyable episode. It was nice that they really tied up many of the loose ends from the previous seasons was nice. Also, Peter Capaldi's first REAL cameo as the Doctor was nice. For some reason, I'm really looking forward to the next episode.",Positive
"This episode shows both together and apart, the bond of friendship across many miles and differing circumstances.  It cements Christina and Meredith through extraordinary and everyday events in their lives.  It is difficult to make a split screen then full scene work well between story lines but this ""Grey's Anatomy"" does that very well.  Those who are observant and attentive will see both psychological and experiential events unfold about the previous pivotal plane crash episode.  If you need it spelled out, you are not engaging deeply enough in this fine example of television drama unfolding at its best.",Positive
"Think this is the last season...am following the conclusion. My one soap opera and guilty pleasure. Love the writing, the characters and most of the actors. Become a Grey fan...",Positive
"Fans of ""Fringe"" saw the main storyline wrapped up in season four but there were still numerous loose ends and the fifth season gave showrunner Josh Wyman the chance to tie those up(for the most part). Given a shorter season (the magic 100 episodes reached for syndication with the 13 for season five) and a smaller budget, the fifth season examined many of the themes from the prior seasons and closed things off in an uneven but largely satisfying conclusion.SPOILERS:Season five functions almost as a reboot for the series in many respects as it takes place 21 years from 2015. The Fringe team (Olivia, Peter, Walter and Astrid) were ambered and are revived by their daughter to help fight The Observers. It seems that they weren't as beign as believed; September and his 11 other cohorts were scouting our time for an invasion from their time as their world has been so badly depleted of resources, it is dying.The Fringe team must put together the pieces of a puzzle existing in Walter's brain as he came up with a plan to defeat The Observers but can't recall it due to an interrogation that damages his memory.END OF SPOILERS:The fifth season for ""Fringe"" was a bit uneven with episodes that felt like filler episodes but the best ones hold their own with some of the best of seasons one through four. Although the production values weren't quite as strong for season five, the fifth season still had marvelous performances from the cast.Although there are numerous plot holes left by this season (I can't reveal them because to do so would provide too many spoilers), Wyman and his team of writers/directors do a good job of providing an emotionally satisfying conclusion to the show.The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a sharp looking transfer that provides lots of detail (you can even see light acne on the face of one actor in one sequence). The cool look of the show is nicely captured on the blu-ray discs.The 5.1 lossless audio sounds marvelous with nice use of surround effects. We get subtitles in English, Spanish and French.The special features include a single commentary track for ""Black Blotter"" featuring writer/producer J.H. Wyman and editor Jon Dudkowski. Every season of ""Fringe"" had an unusual, experimental episode and this is the one. It's a terrific one particularly with its unusual salute to Terry Gilliam and Monty Python.""A Farewell to Fringe"" features the cast, J.J. Abrams, J.H. Wyman and others in past and present interviews discussing the series. This runs about 20 minutes and is nicely complimented by the Comic Con panel on the series done just before season five premiered. It features the primary cast members (minus Blair Brown)discussing their favorite moments, the character development and answering a couple of questions posed by the audience.We also get a couple of deleted scenes as well as the gag reel all presented in HD. As a nice touch we also get a copy of the final script on the disc which you can read. It might have been nice incorporating it as an interactive feature with the final episode but I'm not complaining too much; Warner could have given usnothing in the way of special features.The three disc set also includes an episode guide and the package is housed in a cardboard slipcase.Although the final season was a bit short and some of the episodes were uneven, the final season was an emotionally satsifying one even if the show was quite a bit different from the preceding four.",Positive
"The show should be called ""Southern Exposure"" - It's pretty much the same concept as ""Northern exposure"", except here it's a NY female doctor in Alabama, instead of a NY male doctor in Alaska. Again - it's the ""fish out of water"" story line, and how the local ways ""grow"" on the urban doctor, who learns to appreciate them.It's kind of a ""fluffy"" show, but sweet, romantic and FUN, with great music as well.",Negative
my kids loved it,Positive
"I love Under the Dome!  The story line is very engaging.  It's one of those shows that you make sure you don't miss.  There's a few episodes left, and I'll definitely be watching!",Positive
I love Revenge and find most episodes to be deserving of at least 3 or 4 stars.  Ready for it to be done though.,Negative
"I wasn't holding on to hope with this show being any good, despite the actors, producers and quality of filming. There is certainly an &#34;Alien&#34; vibe here, but it works! It is working! I love it. *SO FAR: I've only watched the first 4 episodes...... maybe things will go dumb. Fingers crossed they don't!",Positive
"The &#34;found footage&#34; approach worked as a novelty in The Blair Witch Project.  Once was enough.  This one appears to imitate that style.  We could not enjoy the shaky amateur photography used in such films.  For that reason, we watched only ten or fifteen minutes of this one before moving on to something else.  In fairness, it may have had some good points, but we did not stay to find them.",Negative
"There are too many scenarios that just don't seem realistic:* why would all those people try to topple the ambulance ... and from both sides?* what happened to all the people who were in the road and at the front of the ambulance before he moved forward? They suddenly disappeared, and not one person was run over during the escape. Right.* the road was wide open for them to drive right out of a business center into a residential neighborhood .. this was a workday obviously, and everyone would be trying to get to loved ones.* obviously some serious shtf, and none of these retards stops to think for a second about security? Just leave the gate open. Hell the show doesn't even let us know if it's open or not.Suspension of disbelieve was broken so many times, I couldn't stand to watch another episode.",Negative
"I was not ready for a new Doctor and did not expect to like him but David Tennant is fantastic - I wonder if there can ever be another Dr Who to compare with him.  Rose was the perfect companion for him and the chemistry was compelling. The story lines, the characters and the special effects make this Series outstanding.",Positive
I've liked this from the beginning and am on my last episode in the fifth season. I am sorry it is no longer on the air.,Positive
I watched one episode of the first season then decided that this show was meant for teenagers or even early twenties.  Since I am not of that generation the show held little for me.,Negative
"This is a wonderfully well written series, which had me rooting for the designated bad guy the entire time.A small town policeman, not above dirty dealings,  harbors secrets from his past  which affect everyone in his life, particularly his mentally ill wife.  He rationalizes his behavior, which is based on betrayals and lies, covering up his own family's crimes while persecuting Indians for drugs.His wife, unsympathetic in the beginning, is completely duped by him, as she is by her politician father who is prepared to buy her way out of any situation. And my guess is that Daddy will prove to be a heinous figure behind the dumping of toxic waste on  Indian lands&#8212;certainly he has the power to stop t the tribe getting the official recognition  they need to help them acquire federal funds to clean up the waste which is making them ill.At the heart of the story is the wife's twin brother who as a teen drown in the lake, or did he, since he was making recordings of his observations which might have far reaching implications in the next season.Into this background enters the insanely handsome Jason Momoa, playing a mixed race prodigal returning home  after a stint in a Florida prison. He has ties to the long dead dead teen  and the wife, which will emerge in the course of the story. He is involved in the sale of stolen prescription drugs&#8212;but certainly he is a better man than his gangster father, whom he works for; or the weaselly cop; or the rich politician daddy. In any case, he is unloved ,unwanted and much maligned- and although he does some things to protect his own position which are not entirely palatable&#8212;he seems at heart a gentle giant.I won't give out any spoilers&#8212;but this is a character driven drama&#8212;and though there is tension and gun play&#8212;the underlying plot is much more subtle&#8212;and the two tiered society, red and white, rich and poor, powerless and powerful is much more interesting&#8212;as are the dynamics between the characters&#8212;who all harbor deep secrets. 4 and a half stars",Positive
Books and movies that are not predictable are my favorite. This movie took me awhile to catch on to the premise so I gave it a good rating. The beginning drags only because it is out of sequence to the story. It takes time to get used to the back and forth of the story line and then it hits you what is going on. At that point everything makes sense. I'm trying not to give anything away so details about the story won't be given here. I would suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys something different.,Positive
"The stop-motion animation is very colorful and the character design is appealing. However, they don't have a whole lot to do. Mostly, they stand around and chit-chat about mundane topics that the audience can't relate to. You're in outer space; do something outer spacey. I'm sure working on a space ship will be boring as all get out, but that's not going to make for an interesting show. So, more adventure and more weirdness are going to be needed to make this catch on. The humor is just too low key. It's like Futurama without Bender or Lost in Space without Dr. Smith.",Negative
"For anyone who wants to really enjoy this five star, most excellent series, you won't see it on this cut down, over edited version.  Obviously the most recent batch of movie hackers have no appreciation for the hard work and supreme talent the origional ROME series was all about.  It's sad to see this happen again, during the first launch of HBO on Amazon.But the uncut disks, producers cut, and you won't be sorry.  Watch this version on Amazon, and you're missing 25 percent of the movie.",Positive
"My grandsons love Oswald. It is perfect for young kids, not offensive in any way. Storyline is easy to follow.",Positive
"I liked the first season of this series, it was somewhat original and quirky while being a bit stereo typed, the &#34;bad cop turned good&#34; and the &#34;conflicted girl with a heart of gold and a past&#34; set to a Miami Vice theme, alligators, Armani suits and bikinis. The second season wasn't bad, even though there was a strong sense of &#34;I've seen this before&#34; and the super hot woman police inspector/supervisor didn't work at all. By the third season this series has simply become an excuse to show hot girls in bikinis, there is no pretense of a story or anything resembling a mystery or a thriller. It's almost as if the writers got bored with it. Nicely produced, well filmed but the story got lost in a hot tub.........",Negative
"Nothing to really say except more Bill F***ing Murray! Without him as a regular, this is a big turkey. I like all of the actors, but the comedy seems very forced - like it would make a great SNL skit, but anything longer gives the viewer time to realize that the concept is very 1980s.",Negative
"I laughed out loud in quite a few episodes. Very entertaining couple who loved each other 38 years ago, and now re-connects in spite of their changed habits and personalities. Family, friends and business issues we can all relate to and how in a charming funny way they navigate thru them.",Positive
This show is something else. I would have it on loop if I could. I think my family would hate it after a while. But bob is hilarious. Linda is hilarious. The kids are hilarious. Everyone in the show plays a specific part that is not seen in other movies or shows. It just so good you have to see it to understand.,Positive
"By the time I finished this I was not sure if the movie was about the title character or the narrating soul searcher played by Colin Hanks. I think in the end, the filmmakers did not care either way and after watching the special features I became aware it was more about Malkovich doing what he does so well, nothing more or less. Is always nice to see Tom Hanks even if just for a few minutes.The Blu presentation was average throughout, with literally two or three scenes utilizing the DTS in adequacy. Everything looked a bit better than the DVD in both color and clarity, but the majority of the indoor sequences have plenty of grain. I was hoping the special features would bump this up but I could only give them a half-star more than the 3.5 for the film. The deleted scenes were thankfully cut, the extended scenes of each mock interview (Regis, Martha, etc.) were included as a separate feature - but were rightfully cut short also. The outtakes were unfunny and easily showed some irritation by Malkovich when someone else would screw up. The 9 minutes of behind the scenes were painfully all about the usual how great everyone is, the 4 minute blip from HDNet was the promo they had been showing for awhile leaving the only worthwhile supplement as the interview of the real guy that ""inspired"" Buck Howard. His quick talk sums up the film: everything John did on the stage was right on - anything else is all made up by the filmmakers.Not exactly a test Blu, but can suffice for a mellow evening rental with only one supplement worth watching.",Positive
The show has good dramatic writing--assuming you ignore the errors concerning modern forensics.  Too many times the MC's club-members spit in the face of an enemy they've killed for any of them to be riding free.,Positive
"Run,nay flee from this piece of trash.Alas,silicon speak is not for me.Endure it not for there is no plot.Close your eyes and it will go away.",Negative

This is an excellent series.  The acting is great. I have enjoyed all four seasons.  I look forward to the rest of this seasons episodes.,Positive
"I now own 9 seasons of this video, I have always loved the Law & Order series, all of them  and hope to own them all.",Positive
"Is a very good Nickelodean series for the teens and for the parents . Remember this is a UK  production , not USA.They make a small series based on the book, very good quality product!",Positive
"This series is fun and you can actually learn some history facts.  But beware that many of the show's host will come to some conclusions that are of his opinions and not necessarily true fact.  Still, the investigative team is entertaining and can make you think.",Positive
"Super interesting storyline but I just didn't love the way they told her story. I was definitely disturbed but aside from the parts portraying the abuse aNd mistreatment of Linda, I was bored with the rest of the plot. If u have netflix instant, it's available on there free with membership. Too bad they didn't add that Til AFTER I blew my dough on this rental. Peter Saaragard is beyond creepy and by all men's considering his real life interest in marrying underage girls, he was perfect for this role. Amanda Seyfried was great too but the story could have been so much better. Want edit o love it but didnt",Negative
These two dumb girls decide to ride their bikes and come across a water tank. They are drunk and strip to their underwear. It is dark so one jumps in and the other follows without even checking the tank for a way of escape. Well the water is at a low level and they have a hard time getting out.I waited till the end to see if they ever could figure out how to get out and it was quite clever I will admit. But not everything goes right! The ladder was too high so they had to improvise. If I ever got stuck in this situation I will remember this trick but I won't get into this situation!,Negative
"PLEASE NOTE: Reviews are opinions. The purpose of the reviews are to HELP those who haven't seen the show decide whether or not they want to purchase/read/watch/listen to something. That's what the voting is for NOT if you agree or disagree with the reviewer. If you disagree-write a review. The comments section IS for those who want to disagree.The second season of ""Heroes"" stumbled with its story arc involving Hiro traveling back in time to feudal Japan. FYI, that subplot IS tied into the main plot of the second season. The focus here is on the Shanti Virus a concoction that can take away someone's powers but IS often lethal. There is also someone targeting those who were involved in the founding of ""The Company"". As with ""Lost"" the introduction of new characters was problematic--fans were more interested in finding out what happened to their favorites from season one. The show recovers somewhat by midset unfortunately the show was interrrupted by the Writer's Guild strike. I have no doubt that the second half of the second season would have made up for the stumbling start of season two based on what we find out in the extras but that didn't happen.The show looks extremely good in its DVD presentation. The extras are quite good as well which does make up for the diminished quality of the show. We get 11 commentary tracks. I haven't had time to listen to more than one or two of them but they are pretty good. If I'm not mistaken these are the audio versions of the video commentaries that were available on the ""Heroes"" website.A couple of the featurettes included here were also on the webiste. The most effective and interesting ones here are the preview of season three (which has some minor spoilers so you may want to wait to watch it if you want to be totally surprised)and a featurette that allows us to see how a series of scenes wer constructed.""Heroes"" still has tremendous potential and here's hoping that the third season ""Villians"" is an improvement over the second season. This is a good set but isn't as strong or as good as the first season of ""Heroes"".Rent it.",Negative

"I LOVE this show, the writing and acting is edgy, fun, poignant, a full range of emotions.  Season one for me was rocky the first time around, was much better the second time I watched it, even then I saw improvement with each episode.  Season two shows what the show could be, and now with season three they have hit their stride!  You will not be disappointed with any season of this show.",Positive
"Young Morse is back for more, a little shell-shocked after the 'incident' at the end of the last season (I won't say what it is; I do not want to give 'spoilers'), and it's great to see such smart, quality drama return to our screens.  My only criticism were a few of the anachronisms that I spotted (the other reviewer spotted some, too).  With so much photographic evidence of mid-'60s hairdos, it amazes me how often the hair and makeup departments get this wrong. Still, these are minor points in an otherwise top notch, high-quality, cerebral drama that actually requires the viewer pay close attention. Yet the star of the show is literally the star of the show; Shaun Evans is an understated force to be reckoned with, the impetus of his character (a true desire to avenge murder victims) played out with understated intensity. I would love to see him awarded the same fame and acclaim as the flashier Benedict Cumberbatch.",Positive
Superb...better than the film!,Positive
This is actually a very good drama set against an end of the world type situation.  If you like Walking Dead and Revolution you will like Survivor.,Positive
I have watched this show since season 1.  Both characters along with the rest of the cast are excellent.  Absolutely no exceptions.  This show is so well put together I cannot stop getting enough of it.  I recommend it HIGHLY to anyone who is out just exploring it.  I have all four seasons and love them all.,Positive
This series is a disappointment. Painfully slow-moving and artificial. Cannot compete with Downton Abbey,Negative
If you liked the old Dallas then you will love the updated version of this. The writers are brilliant without compromising the original. Little nuisances in both set and script keeps your dedication to the original. Can't wait each week for the next one.,Positive
Ed Bagley is superb in this show.  Show overall is good just a lot of tech and to tell the truth think social media with everyone spilling there guts is the stupidest thing ever invented.....along with reality TV!,Negative
"Vincent (Tomer Sisley)  is a corrupt cop who along with his partner has botched a cocaine heist.

"One of the best movies ever! I watched seasons one through five on Netflix, in one week!! Then I went nuts--had to find season six. Leave it to amazon! Absolutely loved the show, Absolutely LOVE Charlie Hunnam!",Positive
"The film opens up with the characters sitting cleverly in a ""Last Supper"" pose. They are introduced grindhouse style which was awkwardly inserted into the opening credits. Our group of exorcists come from various religious backgrounds. They maintain themselves in a state ready for damnation in case they must entice a demon for self possession followed by a quick suicide. Our holy men swear profusely, drink, do drugs, engage in adultery, homosexuality, and gluttony.  In a Ghostbusters plot steal, they are attempting to save NYC and the world from the apocalypse while fitting eviction.  They ride public transportation.The film outline is great. However it lacked decent dialog under all the swearing which grows old. The climax scene couldn't bring it together and lacked the entertainment value of earlier scenes. I kept imagining how well this could have been as a Coen brothers' film with Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Woody Harrelson, Zach Galifianakis, Winona Ryder, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and James Franco.Parental Guide: Excessive swearing. Photo nudity.",Negative
"Great action, wonderful for working out to, and the writing is not insulting like a lot of the stuff in this genre.",Positive
"Alphas has an interesting premise:  quirky individuals with extra-special abilities.  I enjoy it, for the most part.  For me, the major drawback to the show is that the idiosyncrasies of the individuals are often extreme, making them less likable.",Negative
"His enthusiasm is contagious.  He seems to see the good and the potential in others.  Yet he always has his purpose, a big goal to achieve.At the time of this interview, he could not have known he would quickly take over Apple and turn it into America's most successful company.  I would have loved working with him, I think.",Positive
"Thoroughly enjoyed this series.  Never heard of it before but was immediately taken, well acted and very developed storyline kept my attention.  Highly recommend :-)",Positive
"10/10 would watch again.Starts off intense and yet confusing, as it should, and then starts the build up as the characters we all know and love continue to work through the complications that have arisen in their lives.",Positive
"Growing up in that era, I was aware that this type of surveillance was possible.  It would be hard to be the moles and equally hard to be their friend or acquaintance (after their exposure).  It would be a hard life.  The series keeps you riveted and wanting more.",Positive
"Very talented actors, good script, exceptional lesson of humility and humanism. It's beautifull to see and follow. Script is very good....Perfect!",Positive
Fascinating serial that has more twists and turns than an arthritic snake.  It has a constantly changing story line and a very moral base to it and perhaps that is what appeals to me most  -- the integration of moral considerations in a changing universe.  And yet it is not overly moral either with plenty of blood and gore to satisfy that side of the equation.,Positive
"I have watched and owned all the seasons and will continue to.  this is a sitcom unlike any other, about intellectuals (nerds) who have the same life as everyone else! it is fun to watch the dynamics of all the characters.",Positive
One of the funniest shows ever. I watch it over and over.. .the characters are real and the comedy so low brow it is fantastic.,Positive
Had never watched this series before and didn't know it even was on line until Amazon Prime -- very good series -- well worth the time and watching,Positive
He can worm anything out of anyone if given the chance.  This is another TV series I throughly enjoyed and was cancelled.,Positive
"Its simply a great show, its fun, you know the somgs and its easy entertainment.  between Darren Criss' singing and just everything Jane Lynch, its worth watching.",Positive
I was very impressed...........I really hope this gets picked up.............I cant wait to know what happens.............it kept me wanting more..............loved the characters - well acted - nice to see familiar faces :)  great storyline..............what else can I say exept amazon this is a keeper !!!!,Positive
"If you've watched House of Cards this is a similar D.C. political drama. However, where House of Cards sucks you in this show has you laughing.An enjoyable show that is fun to watch but not so gripping that it will have you binge watching until the sun comes up.",Positive
Bosch holds great promise with the suspenseful ending despite the fact that the ending credits revealed Bosch's &#34;inner demon.&#34; If you want to be &#34;spoiled&#34; go back and check out the ending credits again. The acting and drama is good despite the over-concentration on  Bosch's smoking habit. This could be a great series.,Positive
"Fantastic drama, the only problem I have with it is that it lacks the motivation as to why the Scandinavians and Saxons attacked England, and that is the Christians under Charlemagne attacked Fris",Positive
"I have to admit, I was a little worried about where the show would go after Red John, but in just a few episodes my doubts are erased.  Now that Jane has avenged the murder of his family, there seems to be a possibility of his actually being happy again at some point, and it really shows in the lighthearted manner with which he &#34;breaks in&#34; his new team members.  I also like that there is still a larger subplot, running through the episodes.  Jane's loyalty and affection for Lisbon has always been one of the nicest parts of the show, but it would always have felt wrong for there to be anything more to it.  With his wife's murderer dead, he doesn't have to be &#34;the arrow sprung from the bow&#34; any longer, so who knows...  :)",Positive
"Entertaining but predictable.Was interested in seeing this because of M Strahan's executive producer role.Wouldn't have much dialogue except for the locker room language, but in all enjoyed it",Negative

"Browsing through the Amazon catalog of streaming movies and saw this one and its ratings, so I took a peek at one of the episodes (can't remember now which one) and within just a few minutes of watching and fast forwarding I knew this particular video wasn't for me.  I have nothing really bad to say about it, actors, story, etc., just wasn't something that held my interest.",Negative
"I think this would make a great series. I like the drama. The series is a bit out there and it does go all over the place, but overall its funny and deserves a chance. Especially with the actors and writing being as good as it is.",Positive
"We like the acting and the plots are intriguing, though sometimes rather complicated.  The accents are difficult for us to catch sometimes, but we make do or replay portions.  Entertaining.",Positive
"Love the action,  story line, and actors. Good always from the beginning to the very end. Finally caught up on all the shows.",Positive
I like this series and enjoy the interactions of the characters.  I read one of the novels after the first season on TV.  Quite a difference in the characters.  Angie Harmon is fun to watch.  I still think NCIS would have been better if Sasha Alexander had stayed on and her character had not been killed.  I really like the supporting cast in this show.,Positive
Interesting case solving,Positive
"First off, I've enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades, and they've all had some things in common, and they've all had some differences. Most of them steal from the original (Bram Stoker) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources (such as Anne Rice) because vampire canon, such as it is, was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re-invented imaginatively by Anne Rice. I loved, loved, LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the TV show, not the movie) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show, as was its spin-off Angel.That said, I disagree with most reviewers who've said Moonlight is a rip-off of Buffy or Angel. It is not. The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires, not the pantheon of assorted trolls, demons, and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated. Also, the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans -- and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight, the short-lived (3 seasons) CBS ""Crime Time After Prime Time"" early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto. Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight, in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the ""monster"" he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built-in emotional tension for character and relationship development, plot devices, and historical flashbacks/backstory. Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman, with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger, death, or some other terrible outcome (the human being ""turned"" vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath); thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other's lives (plot device), and only half-heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same, er, species (living or undead) (also plot devices). And, like Nick Knight, Mick St. John prefers not to drink (eat) humans -- but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood, Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood. Moonlight, in those respects, is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight. (After this point, there are SPOILERS, so you may want to stop reading now...)However, there are some clever differences: Forever Knight's big, bad sire vampire LaCroix, who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his ""gift"" of eternal life (and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor/protege possessor/possessed relationship) has been replaced by Coraline. Coraline is Mick St. John's ex-wife and sire on Moonlight -- an apparently evil female vampire who'd lived some 500 years, sired Mick (made him a vampire) on their wedding night (in 1952), and enmeshed him in an obsessive, addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually couldn't. He never wanted to be a vampire -- he didn't even know she was one when they married. She made him a vampire against his will, without asking him or getting his permission. Now, of course, he has ""trust issues."" She, from her perspective, gave him a ""gift"" of eternal life -- freedom from death (sounds familiar -- like LaCroix on Forever Knight!).Coraline crossed a fatal line, however, when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little ""family"" (sounds familiar, eh? rather like Lestat, Louis, and Claudia in Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire). Mick, by this time (1982), was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective (it is implied, though not directly stated, that he ""does good"" as a PI because he feels guilty about the ""bad"" he's done as a vampire). It was in this capacity that the girl's mother approached him to find her daughter Beth -- only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re-invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes don't kill vampires, they just paralyze them. Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe. Mick, in his PI role in the first episode, finds the distraught mother's little girl, rescues her, stakes his crazy ex-wife/lover/sire Coraline to paralyze her, and sets the place on fire before locking her in. The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family. Thus begins Mick's distant ""relationship"" with Beth Turner, who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire, a mostly online magazine that's not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox's character Lucy edits on FX's show Dirt, except it's less celebrity-focused and more local crime story sensationalism. Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight, ""No Such Thing as Vampires,"" Beth, now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions (but news-whore tendencies), winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers. Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA (with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef, a 400-some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring, formerly on Veronica Mars).I didn't watch this episode on CBS. In fact, I didn't watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all -- I watched them on CBS' web site of full video, Innertube. I was intrigued by Alex O'Loughlin's eye-candy good looks, I've always loved the vampire genre, and I dearly loved Jason Dohring's dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars, so I knew I wanted to catch the show. But I wasn't about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing. The first episode was as predicted: stilted dialogue, cliche-ish plot devices, utterly predictable plot and twists.However, what keeps me watching the show are several things: (1) the show has a beautiful, SoCal corrupt clarity about it, a noir look that is dark, decadent, sexy, and shiny; (2) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he's on it because he's got screen presence and, despite the poor material, seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills, including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language, which communicate volumes; (3) Jason Dohring, who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen, and plays his amoral, jaded vampire role to the hilt, practically eating up the scenery, and (4) Sophia Myles, who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight (in the first Underworld movie) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion, and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin. She also isn't your typical stick-thin, anorexic-looking TV actress; the girl's got a little meat on her bones. So, unlike many of the women on TV, she actually occasionally looks like a ""real"" woman. Finally, (5) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it's set in -- LA -- and the surface-obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode, however, was straight out of B-movie (or is that B-TV) hell. I thought, ""Eh, that was was pretty; I'll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better."" I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O'Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back, too. But I wasn't expecting much from the show based on the first episode. I figured it would be my guilty pleasure, something I'd watch as ""webisodes"" and not much else.Surprisingly, it's getting really good. This has a lot to do with improved writing, developing backstory, intersecting relationship triangles, and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick's ex-wife and vampire sire Coraline. It's still eye candy, but I don't feel as guilty about watching it -- and now I actually watch it on TV. I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox. I credit mostly Alex O'Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this. But the most recent episodes (we're up to episode 9 now) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick, while also increasing the tension between Mick's happily-amoral and happily-non-human friend Josef (Jason Dohring) and the unhappy, secretly self-hating Mick, who longs for a cure for his vampirism, some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick ""went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster"" has only improved the show's ""grab"" factor. The chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn, but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon. And there's a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well. There are some very sexy (though still network-TV-permissible) scenes on later eps and I'm looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake: like Angel, Buffy -- and Forever Knight before them, as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night -- what makes Moonlight, and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires. It's that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human, and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two (or three or four) evils, or when emotion overrules reason in our decision-making. They're still vampire shows, and that will result in some people dismissing them outright -- just as some people dismiss science fiction as not ""serious"" literature. But as Battlestar Galactica fans know, it's not the genre that defines the shows, it's the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they're thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective, this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all, and neither is the second. But the show is coming along, it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode, ""No Such Thing As Vampires,"" and the second Moonlight episode, as the contrived set-ups they are for the seven following (more entertaining and less contrived) episodes.",Negative
Have loved the characters and most of the writing but the depths gone to of violence and evil are unwatchable.,Negative
starting with an actor who was noted for military roles and still going on today Dr. Who is part of many of our lives.The original shows were on miniscule budgets and demanded a lot more imagination from the viewers than today's shows.The Aztecs in this show were probably more comfortable on the London Underground than in the Central American jungles but that doesn't matter.The Doctor is a far cry from today's version-  with no real alien identity (two movies had him as definitely an elderly Earthman)- but that didn't matter- kids loved it and more than a couple of their parents too!.A captivating history lesson,Negative
"An interesting concept for an interesting and ambiguous crime series.Roth is an alien, a legal alien, an Englishman in Washington DC. He is a highly paid professional in the business of lie detection. He runs a company that sells services to all kinds of agencies. You name them, he serves them.His specialty is facial expression and body language. His hobby horse is 'micro expression', facial situations of less than a second, detectable only on film. Roth's business is consequently the ultimate spying approach: film people and watch the tapes to catch the ungarded moment. Of course his firm is also able to analyze voices, hence sound is also taped.He has a female American partner and two ethnic American specialist staff: an Israeli and a Hispanic woman. Roth is the ultimate expert who will manipulate even his own team to his purposes.The basic message of the series: be smarter. Don't try to beat the truth out of your suspects. It is more comfortable to catch them in contradictions and lies.So far so good, if you want to accept that these things can be done and that they should be done, as they might work better than other approaches. Of course nobody would want to live with living lie detectors like these, hence their private lives are troubled.Why do I deduct a star? First of all, Roth is so much the star here, most other actors move like wooden puppets. Casting is uneven, to say it politely. Second, the range of possible stories is limited, so unavoidably some of the episodes are contrived or lame. If you delete half of the series (but how do you know which ones?), you will have an interesting and even challenging TV entertainment. Challenging not because it is hard to grasp, but because its ethical implications are far from clear.",Positive
"Something to watch, somewhat entertaining.  If you are the kind of person that is annoyed by hollywood stereotypes of rural people, you'll be annoyed.  If you are the kind of person that likes realism in your movies you'll be really annoyed.  But if you like more or less mindless action (I kind of do) and can ignore the BS stereotypical ""art/social commentary/propaganda message"" crap, it's not a bad movie as far as action goes.  And they used great cameras and professional directing.  But they leave a major part of the plot unresolved.  Also, it's extremely annoying that people are able to just brush off major injuries that would put incapacitate the average person or at least slow them down.  The worst example of this involves the girl's brother.  But I could go on and on about the realism, there isn't any.  The way guns work is also completely unrealistic but typical hollywood.  I'm not going to give this two stars only because the camera work is so well done and there is plenty of action.",Negative
"If you've seen Newsroom on HBO(or showtime), then this show is similar, the background happenings at a news tv show, only it's The Onion News Room. Jeffrey Tambor stars.  The Onion writes funny stuff and this show is no different.  Layered with funny in both dialogue and in randomness.  Together with a solid cast in place, likable characters, and plenty of The Onions quirky jokes, This show has a lot of legs.  I could see it going 5-6 seasons, doing stories on location and staying relevant to the times.",Positive
the majority of the show consist of extras walking into each other in circles on a street were that many people wouldn't ever be at one time and the main characters not knowing why,Negative

"What happens to a millionaire playboy stranded on a remote island for five years?  Ben Gunn from Treasure Island was completely mad in a little over two, Chuck Noland in Cast Away developed a profound relationship with a volleyball in three and Gilligan did almost everything imaginable in less than four.  But five years of playing survivor, throw in some dangerous adversaries and even torture and you just might get a superhero.During his time on the island Oliver Queen had only one article from his past life: a ledger of his father's pointing to a family legacy built on corruption and exploitation which provides the driving force for survival as he feels an obligation to rectify the wrongs he believes his family has perpetrated on the citizens of Starling City.  Oliver has also learned to hold on to the memories dearest to him in order to survive but after rescue from the living nightmare in episode one, he returns to find that the family he idealized has moved on; his mother has remarried and the attitude that his baby sister now possesses could probably be best described as ambivalence.  His mother unknowingly hires a bodyguard for her less than helpless son that ends up quitting when he discovers the secret identity of his charge.  But the ethical nature of this character provides a counter to Oliver's single-minded pursuit of justice as he later convinces him to assist in the logistics of his mission although I believe he needs him more as a conscience and a compass to what should be done as opposed to what the Green Arrow is capable of.At times this series may digress a bit towards inter-personal drama but it's buoyed by action and to be completely honest that's what keeps me coming back to this show.  Anyone can do well-choreographed fight scenes but in this case it's all about filming in such a way as to maintain a certain level of believability as well as making the viewer actually ""feel"" the action.  Additionally, the violence is subtle and tastefully done; how many shows can say that? At the writing of this review I'm still not very impressed with any of the female characters but it's still early and there's lots of potential and I'm sure they will continue to introduce new heroes and villains.  Speaking of which, the addition of the character that will eventually become the Huntress provides a sort of polemic to the heroic vigilantism of the Green Arrow as he demonstrates respect for the inherent value of human life while the latter is motivated by end justifying the means.I just wish the critics would stop comparing this excellent television series with prolly one of the most exceptional super-hero film series currently around (i.e. Batman).  As another member of the DC superhero universe, of course there's gonna be similarities in some of their characters... get over it.  I suppose if you can't then just keep watching those films over and over again but for all of us lovers of creative/fantasy/super-hero, television-entertainment.... there's Arrow.  :o)",Positive
"This was a delightful and surprising movie. Yes, it's a bit unrealistic and they fall in love too quickly, but if you can look past that, you're sure to appreciate the humor, the sweet romance, and the stunning scenery. During the first fifteen minutes, I'll admit to not being sure if I would enjoy it, but the more I watched, the more I wanted to watch. It is truly a charming story meant to entertain and delight. If you don't laugh and smile along the way, then you didn't watch the same movie as I did, or perhaps you did, but from a different point of view. I would recommend it, and I may even watch it again.",Positive
"My girls are 10 and 6.  They watch what the 10 year old wants much of the time.  The content of iCarly may be a little mature for the 10 year old (I'm thinking a 12 year old target) and is mostly boring to the 6 year old, but I am seldom concerned with it and the fun portrayed is mostly slapstick and positive.  I am less troubled by this than many cartoons.  I must say, however, that TV shows like iCarly are enormously effective in setting behavior and family norms and that even my 10 year old is often confused into believing that the real world is &#34;like that&#34; .",Positive
So everything finally comes together. It's great to see storylines from Season 1 being used during this season. And it wraps things up nicely.,Positive
"Smart and funny, sometimes bordering on the ridiculous.  It certainly leaves one wanting more.  Just my opinion; you'll have to form your own.",Positive
"What a movie. Excellent, funny! All around great. Lou Taylor Pucci played Luke perfectly. Can't believe this movie didn't receive more attention/credit. What a shame. Best movie I've watched in awhile. Truly a classic even if most will never see it.",Positive
This was my first Top Chef DVD set. I didn't see it on cable. I was very impressed. I loved it. I have bought other seasons. I will be glad when all of the seasons are on DVD. I look forward to ordering them,Positive
"Prime Suspect is the reason Helen Mirren got an Oscar for &#34;The Queen&#34; and anyone who has not watched every Prime Suspect is doing themselves a disservice. This first season is probably the best, in my opinion. I watched them with my dad and we both absolutely loved it.",Positive
"With that as my title I have to assume that what is depicted in this film must be what an acid trip is like. Oddly enough some have said that yes, this is indeed what it is like. The book on which it is based (which I read and loved) is trippy in itself but bringing that book to screen was not an easy task. Who better to do so then than Don Coscarelli, the man behind the PHANTASM series and BUBBA HO-TEPP.The story begins simply with reporter Arnie Blondestone (played by Paul Giamatti) meeting Dave (Chase Williams) in a Chinese restaurant. Dave has set up this meeting to let Arnie in on a secret: there is a world out there that most of us can't see but that holds some truly bizarre secrets and that might be bound and determined to invade our own world. Arnie asks for details and the story behind Dave's claim and Dave fills him in from the beginning.John (Rob Mayes) is Dave's best friend. They live together and do little except bum around, work terrible jobs and go to raves with their friends where John usually performs. At the particular rave they go to on this night, Dave meets an unusual Jamaican who makes Dave feel a bit uneasy. Eventually Dave ends up taking a drug known as Soy Sauce. How weird of an experience does he have? He wakes to get a phone call from John who wonders if he's talking now or in the future and then warns him of the danger he's about to be in.This is when things begin to get weird. And it's not a bad weird but a good one actually. Both John and Dave, having taken the Soy Sauce, can see a different world than the rest of us can. The drug enables them to see into another dimension and reveals the real people that they talk to and meet. Along the way on their adventure they're joined by Amy, a girl Dave's had a semi-crush on for some time.Bug monsters, possessed policemen, policemen who aren't really there, thugs with big knives and more are just the more normal things that the duo witness. They also discover a plot to take over the world by creatures from the other dimension that only they can stop. Through it all they seem to jump back and forth in time and dimensions. They seem to be the only ones who can save our world, not a comforting thought when we first meet them. But they do show the courage and pluck to take on the task and probably have just enough chutzpah to get the job done.As I said from the start, this film feels like what I'm told a drug trip feels like. If so please, never slip me anything. But at the same time it offers an entertaining film that's unlike most others offered these days. It's fresh and new and holds your interest from start to finish. Coscarelli proves that he truly can make a low budget film that has high budget quality once again. It would be nice if Hollywood would finally realize this and give him the chance to make his movies with a bigger budget while at the same time staying out of his way so as not to ruin it. Am I the only one ready for PHANTASM 5?I'll admit that this movie might not be for everyone. It is, as stated, a bit unusual. But it's fun and it entertains. Will I watch it again? If so, not right away. It's a film that you need to walk away from for a while and then watch once more. Would I like to see them film the sequel (a follow up book has already been published). Certainly! If you're willing to take a risk then you might enjoy this one. Just know what to expect going in.",Negative
The reality of war is very different from even working in the trauma unit in the inner city in the USA. The dedication of each of these men is commendable. You have to admire the selfless way they face incredible risks in a desperate attempt to help injured warriors and civilians. Bless them all.,Positive
"To sum this series up,...Fairy Tales for grown ups! Fun, spooky, and highly entertaining. This series just keeps getting better. Highly recommend. Might be a bit scary for kids under 13.",Positive
"I didn't like this program, it is inane and a pilot that must be trying to boost the actor's career, and he overacts his part in comparison to the rest of the show. The character takes life too lightly considering what his job is and acts the fool non-stop. I don't think there is even a point to the plot.",Negative
"Warning! The following contains spoilers. If you haven't seen Season Three and want to remain spoiler free, do not read this review.Season Three of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was the most debated and controversial yet. Much of the controversy stemmed from the number of hot button political topics it addressed. What other show would take several major characters we know and love and have them execute another character we had known from the beginning of the series for collaborating with the enemy, demonstrating in the process the extreme danger to justice inherent in independent military tribunals (disturbingly similar to the ones that the Bush administration has advocated)? What other show takes up the logic and ethics of suicide bombing by having ""us"" attack ""them"" by the death of another semi-recurring character in an effort to kill recruits for the local police force? Many of the episodes outraged those on the political right, as the parallels with the situation in Iraq was, despite efforts to minimize the resemblance by references by creator Ron Moore in interviews to Vichy France, became increasingly blatant. To his credit Moore, a member of the left but a self-admitted Rush Limbaugh listener, has not had the show lean too heavily to the left for most of the show's run, but in the season's first several episodes that balance fell away. And in the most controversial episode of the season (debated on Internet boards more passionately than I can ever remember any episode of any show) the question of whether genocide against a murderous enemy is justified, pitting several of the major characters on the show against each other.On the other hand, Season Three had several surprisingly uninspired episodes. All of these were of the ""stand alone"" variety. All of the ""mythology"" episodes (to use the X-FILES terminology that Ron Moore himself often uses) were outstanding. In posts on boards, podcasts, and interviews Moore has said that most of these episodes are produced by the insistence of the network. The thinking is that having nothing but arc episodes intimidates potential viewers. But the brute fact is that at this point in the series it is a sheer impossibility for anyone to start watching at this point. This is the beauty of DVDs. Anyone who wants to watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can by buying the DVDs, borrowing them from a friend, downloading them from iTunes, or renting them from Netflix or their local DVD rental store. Bizarrely the networks don't seem to have comprehended the ways that viewing patterns have changed.Season Three is structured around the Cylon occupation of New Caprica and the ongoing effects of that occupation following the rescue of the humans by Galactica. Many of the characters on the show never quite get over their experiences there, in particular Tigh and Kara. Interpersonal conflicts that were created on New Caprica, especially between Kara and Lee, take much of the season resolve, and the whole New Caprica experience doesn't really come to an end until the close of the trial of Baltar in the season finale. In one way or another the experiences there color almost everything that happens during the season.Instead of summing up individual episodes or talking about the major story arcs, I would like to highlight my ten favorite moments of the entire season.1. The Adama Maneuver: During the rescue on New Caprica Adama gets crucial Vipers into the fray by jumping into the upper atmosphere of the planet. Since Galactica cannot fly in an atmosphere, they launch the Vipers as the ship plunges in a fiery ball towards the surface, jumping again just a couple of hundred feet before smashing into the earth. It is - and I say this with little fear of contradiction - the most extraordinary special effect in the history of TV. No one who has seen it has been able to forget it. It is inconceivable that the show won't win the Emmy this year for Best Special Effects (but then, it is impossible to see how they lost to LOST and its black smoke effect last year) and when it does, this is the special effect sequence they will show at the awards.2. Leoben has imprisoned Kara in a living situation that parodies that of a married couple. As they dine Leoben stands beside her and tells her how beautiful she looks. She smiles and rams a pair of skewers through his neck, kicks him back and falls on his chest stabbing him repeatedly. She returns to the dining table, takes a bite, then daintily dabs at her mouth with a napkin, oblivious to the blood that covers one of her hands.3. The death of Jammer: In ""Collaborators"" several characters we've known and loved kill Jammer for being a collaborator during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica. We've known Jammer since Season One when he, Cally, and Socino tried to make a still. But that doesn't prevent him from being shot out an airlock. Nearly as good was the near execution of Gaeta later in the same episode.4. Five great Sharon moments. This is a total cheat, but here are five great moments involving Sharon in Season Five. 1) The last time we saw Sharon in Season Two she was deeply distrusted from not having told Galactica about Cavil being a Cylon. She had told Helo that she wanted nothing to do with him or anyone on Galactica. Our first shot of her in Season Three, her cell door is open and we see it filled with comfortable furniture: a desk with books, an end table and coffee table, wall hangings and curtains, a comfy chair, and a large and extremely comfortable leather couch. Adama is sitting beside her drinking tea and he tells her that he feels all alone, except for her. Clearly in the previous year, somehow Sharon had become just about Adama's closest friend. 2) Because of the new trust Adama has in Sharon, she becomes an officer in the colonial fleet. Through the rest of the season she repeatedly tells others - whether human or Cylon - that she has given the fleet her word and she intends to keep it. Though some doubt her, Adama's faith in her is repaid repeatedly in the season. 3) Sharon enters the Cylon Detention Center on New Caprica to recover the launch keys that are crucial if the humans are to escape from New Caprica. She gets interrupted by D'Anna Biers, who tries to tempt her into coming back to the Cylons with the news that Hera is still alive. Sharon responds by putting a bullet into both her D'Anna's knees. She walks away, saying ""Adama wouldn't lie to me"" (and it turns out he didn't, since he didn't know that Laura stole Hera and faked her death). 4) Sharon and Boomer come face to face. One of the season highlights had to be the show's two major Number Eight's meeting. The irony is intense, since at the beginning of the series Sharon was completely on the side of the Cylons and Boomer was with the fleet, unaware that she was a Cylon sleeper agent. Now, however, Boomer like D'Anna before her tries to convince Sharon that she doesn't belong with the humans. Her reply is to the point: ""I made my decision and I know where my loyalties lie."" 5) Boomer does, however, tell Sharon that her daughter is still alive and is on the nearby Cylon basestar. After Adama confirms with Roslin that Boomer's story is true, Sharon rescues Hera by talking her husband Helo into killing her so that she will resurrect on the Cylon resurrection ship. Only seconds after reaching Hera she plots her return to Galactica. The irony is that only a few minutes earlier Roslin was dressing down both Helo and Adama for their faith in Sharon. Knowing that Sharon is downloading into a new body she tells them, ""And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain. And you as well, Admiral."" What is wonderful is that Laura states all this as if it is in doubt. But less than an hour later Sharon is back on Galatica with Hera. Oh, and Sharon is given her own handle: Athena, a nod to the original series in which Athena was Adama's daughter. And in this one Sharon has become one of his surrogate daughters.5. ""Exodus, Pt. 2"": I said I wouldn't summarize any episodes and I will resist doing that here. But this episode, which contained ""The Adama Maneuver"" I mentioned above, is easily one of the two or three most unforgettable episodes in all of BSG. At the end of 2006 the well-known Internet TV website The Futon Critic issued its annual list of the Top Fifty episodes of the year. With total justification they named ""Exodus, Pt. 2"" the number one episode of 2006, not just of BSG but of all television shows combined. It was that good. Four beats made it stand out. First, Saul Tigh's killing of his wife Ellen for collaborating with the Cylons, second the Adam Maneuver, third, the rescue of Galactica by Pegasus and its destruction, and fourth, Kara learning that Leoben had lied to her by telling her that Kacey was her daughter.6. The fight between Kara and Lee in ""Unfinished Business."" In the Season Two finale we learned that somehow Lee and Kara had fallen out with each other so completely that they were barely able to talk to one another. In this episode we get that back story. Adama has called for a series of boxing matches to air out grievances that crew members feel towards one another. We see Lee and Kara's story intercut with their pounding on each other in the boxing ring, learning of the night of passion that they spent with each other and their declaring their love for one another, and of Kara's sneaking off and marrying Anders the next morning. As Kara and Lee (who she is able to fight evenly partly because Helo beat up on him in an earlier fight and partly because Kara resorts to dirty fighting) collapse into each other's arms, their faces bloody messes, she tells him, ""I missed you."" His mouth filled with blood, he is barely able to say, ""I missed you too."" Her face buried in his shoulder, you can see her smile broadly as the episode ends. One of the best episodes in the show's run.7. In a stunning scene on a Cylon basestar, D'Anna Biers tortures Baltar while he manages to project to a beach where Six makes love to him to get him through the ordeal. As he tells Six ""I love you"" D'Anna hears the words as addressed to her and although torturing him feels deeply moved. It is a sequence that has to be seen to be believed.8. Adama and Laura's intimacy. Through Season Three Adama and Laura grow closer and closer, as intimate as two people can be while remaining completely Platonic. They still have conflicts. When Laura tries to justify stealing Hera and faking her death Adama walks away without even listening to her. And in the finale Roslin feels betrayed by his vote of Not Guilty in Baltar's trial. But you get the sense that they have moved to a new level. That they have an intimacy that can't be affected by mere disagreement. The highpoint of their intimacy might be their smoking dope on New Caprica and cuddling while gazing up at the stars. It is so wonderful to see two people who have shouldered so much in order to save the remnants of humanity to get a few minutes of peace/9. Lee Adama's moment on the stand. During Baltar's trial Romo Lampkin (magnificently portrayed by Mark Shepard) calls Lee onto the witness stand even though he is serving as co-counsel. Jamie Bamber's performance is one of the season highlights and perhaps the best moment in a season finale stuffed to overflowing with truly great moments.10. The last ten minutes of the season: In the final few minutes of the season we learn the identify of four of the Final Five: Tigh, Tyrol, Samuel T. Anders, and Tory (the four T's--giving additional credence to the thought of some that Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace is the fifth member) by their response to a song that they keep hearing in their heads, which turns out, almost impossibly, to be Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"" (leading some to refer to them as the Dylons). Then the Cylons attack. The four new Cylons ponder what to do before Tigh magnificently tells the other three: ""The ship is under attack, we do our jobs. . . . My name is Saul Tigh. I am an officer in the Colonial Fleet. Whatever else I am, whatever else it means, that's the man I want to be. And if I die today, that's the man I'll be. But those lines are rivaled by the last of the season, as Lee pursues ""a bogie at my ten"" in his Viper and discovers none other than Kara Thrace, who had died spectacularly three episodes earlier. She looks at Lee, assures him that it really is her (a fact confirmed by executive producer Ron Moore, who also confirmed that the four Cylons really are Cylons), and tells him, ""It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is. And I'm gonna take us there."" The camera pulls up over their two Vipers and then rapidly pulls back through the colonial fleet, through the pursing Cylons, back through the nebula and an arm of the Milky Way, and then rushes across the galaxy to our solar system, focusing on earth as the season ends. It is an utterly breathtaking moment.This is absolutely essential television. If you care for great television, this is the kind of stuff you have to care about. The tragedy is that while every major television critics has passionately praised the show and while a host of major publications from TV Guide to Time to Rolling Stone have proclaimed it the best show on TV, it has struggled to find viewers. The irony is that many Sci-fi fans don't watch it because it doesn't resort to the clich&eacute;s that dominate the genre and make it in most cases completely unchallenging television and many mainstream TV fans don't watch it because they mistakenly think it will only appeal to Sci-fi fans. It is what it is: the best show on TV. You need to watch this.",Positive
"Great show cleaver, cute,and the girls are beautiful and engaging.Acting is good and this show has some great humorand cleaver plots",Positive
"I am a writer who once belonged to a writers group. My husband is a writer and so are many of my friends. This story rings so true. I even know a self-published writer with the ego of the guy in this film. Nailed a lot of different people in the business like the wife who thinks because someone else can get publish there's no reason why she can't, a guy that just likes to play at being the cool writer rather than actually write. But let me stress, you do not have to be a writer to love this film. It is done in a documentary style that really works. Kaley Cuoco has 'blonde moments' (she can never name a single writer she has read) but her character is much more three dimensional than I excepted at the beginning. The story itself is real but the turns it ends up taking are not what one expects (can't say more without giving away too much). Highly recommended. Very happy I rented this.",Positive
"This is the first season that James the gravedigger is in. He is great to root for because he's not a great talker and he's the biggest powerhouse to play the game. He ends up with 2 idols and makes a bad move. Amanda is one of the stronger girls to play the game but she gets pretty annoying because of how smug she is. Todd is the biggest schemer and deserves to win the game more than anyone else. This season has a big twist that screws the 2 strongest players in the game, Aaron and James. Courtney is probably the weakest player ever to play to game. She starts the game at 93 lbs and ends up at 86 lbs. Jean Robert is the token jerk. Peih Gee is supper annoying and freaks out all the time and she thinks she's somehow the leader of a tribe. James' tribe is great to root for and Peih Gee's tribe is the tribe you hope loses. Jaimee and Erik are both total losers who are great for each other.",Positive
am almost a fanatic when it comes to viewing DOCTOR WHO.will enjoy all issues of the doctor. watching season 3 now,Positive
Made for younger crowds but still cute enough to watch with the kids without getting bored.  Shawn the sheep is still my favorite.,Positive
Love it. Season 3 was a good progression of characters and storyline. Can't wait to start Season 4.,Positive
"Nicely done with quality photography, facts and pride. A tribute to a great country and the forethought to preserve it's  natural wonders for future generations to enjoy and learn from. Thank you for a national treasure.",Positive
"This is extremely addictive to watch, and very intense, I can't stop watching.  It is amazing what a human can endure.  You will get addicted very easily to this show, very well done, and unbelievable true stories",Positive
"I watched to see him and loved this mini series.  It is based on a group of books and would never be good in a regular movie.  However, doing five episodes covered the story very well.  Cumberbatch has the ""acting chops"" to pull off about any role, but he is spectacular in this!  The whole cast was superb.  My heart belongs to ""Sherlock"" but I truly loved this.",Positive
Every episode was great!,Positive
"I liked the first season quite a lot, but I kinda felt that it kept you hanging. American Horror Story: Asylum tied up the second season very well. I had thought the second season would be a continuation of the first. Instead it's a new story line with new characters. However, some of the stars from the first season return as different characters. At first, I thought this was bizarre, but no it's refreshing. The actors in this TV series are really good at what they do. Namely, Evan Peters and Jessica Lange do a wonderful job! I'm so excited to get started on Season 3: Coven. What a great show!",Positive
"An exciting premise of having someone get into a young girl's memories to try and figure out exactly what happened in her past. A real thrill ride trying to stay ahead of this film and figure out all the clues - and a surprise ending which you won't see coming!The only detriment was totally unnecessary tobacco drug use, which should have been omitted from this film.",Positive
"I can't say that I've ever seen a &#34;Bones&#34; episode that I didn't like, so, of course, I bought season 8 and some others.  I don't mind seeing something I like more than several times.",Positive
"I think this series and season 3 in particular was unrealistic, mindless entertainment.  That said, I watched all the season 3 episodes in succession.The acting was very good and so was the editing.",Positive
"A young couple buys a house where ten years ago there was a murder. A series of strange and spooky events take place, Two bodies are found in the strangest place, the couple learns that years ago another couple a married man and a sexy brunette were havung an affair and were murdered. Later on the new home owners begin seeing apparitions, visions of the lovers, murder and the murderer who's face you never see thanks to the mask. This movie does a great job of keeping you guessing and holding your attention the ending is awesome you'll be surprised. At first I thought I was not going to like it I'm glad I gave it a chance",Positive
Though not as good as &#34;A Haunting&#34; it still presents some very eerie and good ghost stories. Better than the &#34;live&#34; and fake ghost hunter shows.,Positive
We love this series. We own all of them and watch them over often. It has a great cast with great chemistry.,Positive
CURRENTLY VIEWING SEASON SIX. VERY GOOD EPISODES SOO FAR.,Positive
"When our grandson visits, there are some videos that we automatically play, but they are usually just noise while he is playing. He really watched the &#34;Wonder Pets&#34;. he watched them so much, we now have the theme song memorized. Cute but it has a good message on cooperation and asking for help when needed.",Positive
"I caught this film as a free sneak peak on HDNET in my home theater a week or so ago and it does seem to play better on a big screen. For a film called ""Monsters"", this film shows very little of them. This may have helped the film to created some atmosphere when the land roaming octopus with squid like tentacles is shown, but the acting and dialogue aren't good enough to carry the film. I wasn't a big fan of 'Cloverfield because they used the POV camera in ways that didn't seem natural and if they had used the POV camera in that film like they did here, it would have been a better movie. The POV camera works, when used as a tool and not the sole viewpoint in a film. A good example of this is 'Quarantine or {REC}.I did like the atmosphere when the monsters are on screen as there is a haunting quality about these huge things. For there size they didn't make much noise and they seem to come out of the black sky eerily! It's effective, but where a film like 'District 9' had too much over the top mayhem, this film is a little too tame. I think it's a film worth seeing, but it isn't anything I would watch more than twice. I think that horror and sci-fi films like all the films I mentioned above(including this film)are all worthy entries in the two genres as they are taking a new avenue to the classic atmospheric tales that scared me as a kid, rather than just being gory or full of jolt shocks to make up for lack of story.",Negative
"The picture on this DVD cover might lead you to expect a tale of demonic possession, with lots of head-twisting and levitating. That's not at all what this movie is about. This film instead gives a fairly accurate portrayal of a crime that actually took place, a matricide committed by two sisters who were bonded with each other by the difficult home life they faced. The sisters' identity remains generally undisclosed to this day because they were minors when they committed the crime.This gives a more complex portrayal of the human motives behind the crime, opting away from any simple &#34;bad seed&#34; interpretations. The film is well-acted and gives a clear, chronological account of the evolution of the sisters' plot. It's a little abrupt at the end, but if you like true-crime stories, and especially stories about how the unthinkable morphs into the thinkable - you'll find this a worthwhile watch.",Positive
"The first several episodes were engaging, but the whole thing soon descends into cheap, stereotypical behavior and predictable plot twists. Even formulaic plots, which this one is, really can be engaging if they are done with style and imagination. But there's not much style or imagination in evidence here. Paint-by-number stage directions, truly annoying characters. Some of the stuff is just silly and not believable.I am on episode 6, but at this point, I'm not sure I can hack it all the way to the final episode.If I change my mind, I'll change the review.Update:I made it about 15 minutes into episode 8 before I gave up completely. My assessment is that this series is about 10% science fiction and fantasy. The other 90% is standard soap operatics, illustrating over and over and over and over again that spooky inexplicable disasters bring out the absolute worst in human nature. Looting, rioting, raping murdering, having babies at inconvenient times, stealing food and water and medicine, from each other, etc., etc., etc., etc.,And the fantasy? Pretty thin stuff.  Trust me. The premise is kind of klunky to begin with and it doesn't get any better.Unless you like cheesy soap operas and endless illustrations of how desperate times bring out the the absolute worst in people from small New England towns - with the occasional whiff of hokey science fiction - then watch something else.",Negative
Started out with a very interesting plot but quickly got weird. If you liked lost you might like this. By the end of the episode your left with a sense that this series will end with everyone waking up from a dream.,Negative
"If you liked or didn't like &#34; Eureka&#34;, I'm not going to review it, you already know what you liked about it. I enjoyed the whole series. I have a couple of favorite episodes from Season 2. I like having the disks. Cable and internet service goes out from time to time, so it's nice to pop in the dvds and watch on my Sony portable. I was glad they ditched the funky potato foam of the 1st season package. This one holds the dvds correctly in place. The box is not going to fill up the landfill, it's going to remain with me for a long time to come, and then it will become a collectible, right?",Positive
The mysteries are well presented with twists and unexpected turns.  Enjoy watching as the mysteries unwind.  Worth a look and if you like mysteries you will like Heat of the Sun.,Positive
"this is the greatest story ever told.  with hardships  and  family ties,  insights to real problems,  which all of us have.  I  don't like meth  makers it distributors  but I  found this  story quite  intriguing .",Positive
"I don't like this season as much, because D'Onofrio is less hot, but the writing is better. However, Vince letting himself go just makes me feel a little sad inside. &#34;Seasons change... people change... &#34; If only he had valued his hotness. :/Anyway, Eames continues to be awesome, but this is the season where Vince had a breakdown and they had to bring in some other cops. DUN DUN! I really don't like the episodes with Chris Noth and his little freckle-boy-woman. Whatever. Chris Noth is okay, but he's no Vincent D'Onofrio. Chasing his &#34;white whale,' Nicole Wallace, comes to a sickening conclusion.",Positive
KEVIN BACON AS THE HERO IS AMAZING IN THIS SERIES.  VILLAIN (JAMES PUREFOY) IS ALSO CONVINCING. LOVE THIS SHOW AND HOPE TO SEE SEASON 2. VERY WELL DONE.,Positive
"This show is just fantastic.  It's a nice balance of battle, drama, and sexy time.  The acting is believable, as is the storyline.",Positive
"Besides Walking Dead, Revolution is by far, my favorite. If you enjoy Sy-Fi, I'm sure this will also become your favorite. I just read in a few of the reviews, that Revolution has been cancelled!! That was like a knife too my heart, and along with other reviewers, where does NBC gather their data, to warrant the cancellation. Let's just hope someone else, with brains, if possible, continues to produce Revolution for us. Currently Grieving for our soon, loss too be.",Positive
I enjoy Justified especially the relationship between Rayland and the other characters in the cast. When Boyd and Rayland are together their dialogue is amazing.. I like the way the character of Boyd has been developed over the past seasons and in this season the character of Rayland is showing his faults more making him more true to life. Ava is given a bigger role in this season also which adds to the show.,Positive
"I was curious what this show was about, but found it to only be mildly intriguing, and more hype than anything else.",Negative
iCarly is a good show the entire family can watch; this show is enjoyed by all of the kids in my neighborhood up to about 8th grade.  The jokes are pretty funny and what I really like the most as a parent is the show doesn't cross the line like a lot of children-focused shows seem to do with being a tad risqu&eacute;.We have watched all of the episodes of this season for free via our Prime membership vs. the regular price of $28.99 for the whole season: not a bad deal!,Positive
"Frankly, I got bored. It went on far too long and I just lost interest. I didn't much care if they found him or not!",Negative
05/17/2014LOVE THIS SHOW...CANNOT WAIT TIL IT COMES BACK ON.IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER!!!  WAS HE NOT ON THEMOVIE &#34;STARGATE&#34;?  I AM WATCHING IT NOW.PLEASE DO NOT WAIT TOOOO LONG TO COME BACK ON LIKE ALLTHE OTHER SHOWS ARE DOING....WE ALL WILL WAIT...,Positive
A lot of information about our leadership here that I did not know.  I would give it 5 stars except that the series seems to praise presidents for some things that I think are anti-constitutional.,Positive
"This shows off the beauty and darkness of rural Ireland beautifully, and the actors are very good, but the background story (at least two seasons worth!) overwhelms the individual episodes and it's presented in an annoying manner.",Negative
"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:I just can't fathom a more harsh penalty promulgated by my delay then to have follow a ""K-Harris"" review!I can't add anything to the excellent outline provided by K-Harris, though perhaps I can compliment with some additional color.  The performances are excellent and as huge fan of UK programming, the 3-main characters all have fine pedigrees:Steven Mackintosh (John the cash house manager) most recently off a stint in the *5 ""Luther""Ashley Walters (Chris the security guard) was seen in ""Hustle"" and ""Outcasts"" among a number of other seriesWarren Brown (Marcus at what can be best described as a clerk that moves the trolleys of cash into the vault) was in the excellent Zombie themed mini-series ""Dead Set""I thought that the plotting was good, though I am not the biggest fan of sequences that move back and forth through timelines.  What really interested me was the motives of the 3-individuals and particularly those of John whose star was on the rise and had a newly adopted daughter (their only child).  While it is not a perfect parallel, John reminds me of a similar character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in what was in my opinion a top 3 movie of the year in 2003 entitled ""Owning Mahowny"".  When PSH's character is asked about the rush he felt when gambling as compared to regular life.  On a scale of 10 he replied ""10 and 2"".I watched the series over 2-nights and would recommend as both a very good program and an excellent well acted change of pace from the norm.",Positive
I often have to watch what my child is watching and usually its entertaining but this was like torture.  It was so boring I was very glad it stopped after 4 episodes.,Negative
I have been watching As Time Goes By for many years. I never tire of watching them. It is English humor and sitcom but entertaining .  The characters all have a special part in the episodes. I love Judy Dench in anything she does. It is a favorite of mine.,Positive
"This is off to a pretty good start for a post-apocalyptic tale. The early scenes in the parking garage went on a bit too long, and I think the &#34;what happened&#34; needs more disclosure. Seems odd that all the people would just be aimlessly running around on the streets bumping into each other just because the power was out.  Characters are a bit stereotypical ... the drunk, the slut, the old lady, etc. BUT it got going in the second half and the appearance at the end of the creepy &#34;thing&#34; was excellent! Hope this gets picked up - would love to see what happens next!",Positive
"This movie brought back memories from a flight I took 20 years ago, from AZ to NY. A 6 hour flight turned into a 21 hour flight, but we got lucky and everyone survived the 'awaiting crash' from icy-weather and faulty mechanics. The devastation of waiting for a plane to crash is something one could never forget. I cannot imagine the Fear of watching the plane go down, not knowing if anyone will survive. In this movie, the plane did go down and the passengers aboard were not so lucky. This is a New Year's Eve to remember as the passengers aboard this flight first discover malfunction through horrifying turbulence, then witness the plane crashing. The crash itself was a Nightmare, but only the Beginning for those who survived as they find themselves running for their lives. An unknown stalker is out there, and the fear becomes terrifying as everyone wonders what is lurking in the shadows. Highly recommended for science fiction, horror, and thriller lovers. The acting is excellent and the story has you on the edge-of-your-seat right to the end as it entertains.",Positive
"It was a funny movie. I liked it. It is not the best movie I have every seen, but on the whole it was quite enjoyable.",Positive
"I love this show, it looks like it is going to be cancelled, such a waste.  If they'd give it time, I think it would grow into a real hit.  The story lines are engaging, the acting is wonderful.  The premise is unique and interesting.  Shows which are different need a time to grow, it is a pity this show will not be given that chance.",Positive
"Here we have the first season of BREAKING BAD.  It is amazing to realize that it is only 7 episodes for the character, plot and drama development is so thorough and realistic another show would need at least double the episodes to achieve it.  The basic plot is a teacher who finds out he is dying of cancer and thru unexpected situations gets the opportunity to make a great deal of money thru manufacturing meth.  He does so to make money for his family to be able to live on after he dies.  But the show is about so much more than this.  Every character is addicted to something and the introduction into the dark world of drugs is terrifyingly realistic.  This is honestly one of the best shows ever to air on television.  It tells a story that may be too dark for some to handle but the superb acting, writing and directing make it all work.  These characters are all believable, necessary and the intertwining of their lives is seamless.The show also succesfully combines deep psychological profiles of each character mixed with the heavy, often disturbing drama.  And the plot always serves a purpose, is realistic no matter how heavy, and is in no way gratuituous.  And with this show we also get one of the best duos ever in Walt and Jesse.  When Jesse, Aaron Paul, a former student of Walt, Bryan Cranston, joins him in the making of meth a perfect chemistry is formed.  BREAKING BAD also provides the occasional comic break that helps alleviate the heavy drama.  This series is a must for its great acting, superb writing and directing and totally unique premise.  If it sounds like any other series you have seen believe me when I say it is not.  The blu ray of course adds a dimension to the series over that of the dvd.  There are many dark scenes but the detail and clarity still shines thru and the scenes with color and specifically the lovely scenery shots pop off the screen.  Audio is superb.  This is  a series that is dialogue driven but when the action sequences happen nothing is held back.  This series is superb and I highly recommend it.",Positive
"StarGate Universe reminds me of StarGate Atlantis that had so much potential that was missed.  When did we start making TV shows that had more action in them than story lines.  Here we have a great premise for a story line that could go on for years.  However, starting with the first episode there was no back story which leave us confused.  That is support to happen.  However, I'm half way through the first season and I'm still trying to figure that part out.  I wish they did like the Avengers movie and did a lot of background with a good amount of action.  Maybe they need to find the MASH writers for help.  Still worth the watch because it will be referred to in future StarGate movies or series.  I'm just glad Ben Browder wasn't in it.  He was good in FarScape, yet he sucked in StarGate.",Positive

"I enjoyed The Sopranos so decided to give this a whirl in order to see if fiction and ""reality"" overlap much. It turns out that this is not only comparing apples to oranges; it is also like comparing the Mona Lisa (The Sopranos) to an avant-garde exhibit that consists of a pile of poop (Mob Wives). I am loathe to review an available season without having watched it in its entirety, but I just couldn't get thru many eps of this... there is only so much dim-witted posturing, backstabbing, lying, and general ugliness that I can handle in any given month (when not balanced out by creativity and other redeeming qualities, as in a work of fiction).From a purely anthropological viewpoint, however, this show has some worth. It provides a small bit of insight into what a blue collar criminal lifestyle can lead to: material wealth, broken families, and a mindset of coming at problems shouting and predisposed to violence. Since Mob Wives is not without context, it also offers perspective on a broader (societal) scale. It is, more often than not, a sickening serial to watch, even if you are prone to being entertained by low culture. I estimate that two of the women are of very low intelligence, one is of low intelligence, and one is of low to moderate intelligence. Aside from needing the money, I can't imagine why these 4 would have agreed to do this show (although if I remember correctly, one of them wanted to write a book, so this is obviously good publicity). They either are clueless about how pathetic they appear to the rest of us, or they don't care (laughing all the way to the bank).I skipped ahead to an episode titled ""Dumb or Stupid?"" (the producers probably would have liked this to be the name of the show, rather than just one episode) because I wanted to see how far these women would go against their ""friends"" at a dinner gathering. Unfortunately, a guy on the set intervened before any blood was spilled. Mobsters just aren't what they used to be.",Negative

"It's scarey enough to keep you watching all the way through, but could have been better. Some scenes are very believable, but others are dumb. There are too many people dying from this strange disease, and no one does anything about it until the next day. You would think Emergency Services would get the government in there faster to take control. You know, the people with bio-hazard suits. It's like the whole town is dying in agonizing pain, and all the CDC does is try to find an explanation based on known symptoms.It's not until night time that they finally tell the doctor to bail, and leave the dying people at the hospital with no one there to care for them. Like that would ever happen.But the folks on the boat who have no contact with the outside world for several hours, and then come ashore to an empty town, now that part was freaky.",Positive

"I'm a 3D enthusiast, so I was intrigued.I have to say, not top notch, the primary enemies of Batman for the most part absent.  Some odd ball selections on villains, which for the most part worked.Backstory has changed a bit (from what I remember in my day), Alfred winds up having a &#34;spy type&#34; background, Katana is the first &#34;Robin&#34;, and Wayne Manor is a veritable fortress with laser defenses and ground to air missiles.Nothing that made the story worse, and in most cases it sort of works.Batman's head, disturbing on many levels as is Alfred's chin.Good action, good fighting sequences, vehicles, buildings, (modelling), meh.Plot, all sort of hangs together.  Nothing amazing, but at least moderately entertaining.",Negative
"I love this show. I own every episode including the 2 part pilot that was part of JAG's eighth season. the cast is great led by Mark Harmon who is also one of the executive producers of the show. I am saddened by the departure of Cote De Pablo and Ziva's character but looks like the addition of Bishop, Ziva's replacement may be on the right track. It's kind of spooky though how the new gal almost looks like a blonde Ziva though the personalities are nothing alike maybe with the exception with the way she took down a suspect in her premier episode before the Thanksgiving holiday. I was also disappointed that NCIS had no Thanksgiving holiday episode. Hopefully they make up for that with a Christmas episode. While some of the cases get a little gory I think sometimes the case being worked takes a back seat to the sub plots going on with the different characters. Over the years we have seen several cast members killed off. I am glad at least that they chose not to kill off Ziva in the end like they did with Kate and Jenny Shepard the NCIS director prior to Leon Vance. I'm not sure about the ghostly reappearances of Gibbs mentor Mike Franks. I think these comebacks are a little over the top even for NCIS. I was disappointed when they killed of Vance's wife Jackie in the episode we witnessed the assassination of Ziva's father Levi David. I think maybe that the producers had an inkling that Cote de Pablo wanted to leave the series before her announcement just prior to the season 11 premier. I miss Ziva but think they are finally moving forward which is what they need to do. Anyway, NCIS is the best show on TV and hope it continues for many more seasons. I will continue to buy every episode. I love the other characters on the show Tony, Tim, Abby, Jimmy, and of course Duckie. I read somewhere that they hoped the new gal Bishop wouldn't continue to sit cross legged on the floor with papers spread all over. I suspect she will probably still do that even if she has her own desk. It's part of her character at least for now until we become more familiar with her as does Gibbs and the rest of the team.",Positive
"This movie wasn't what I thought it would be.  I enjoyed the actual historical part of the film, and knew I knew there would be some &#34;biographic&#34; information.  What I didn't expect was long stretches of anecdotal testimony.  It appeared to me that there was an attempt to stretch too little material into a time slot that was too big.  On another note it was interesting to hear about the reasoning for prohibition, the hypocrisy, and the push to repeal prohibition.",Negative

After 3 seasons you might worry the the Venture Bros' parody of 70s and 80s cartoons would get a bit tired.  Don't worry.  The show is a funny and fresh as it ever was.  There is a GI Joe parody half way through that's worth the price of admission.At the same time characters who started as transparent parodies have grown and become fully realized characters that viewers can care about.This is one of the best cartoons on TV and I recommend picking it up.,Positive

"I really enjoyed this show.Premise: the ""official"" story is that Alcatraz closed in 1963 due to high maintenance costs and it being run down, so the prisoners were all relocated, but in truth they all just disappeared one day without a trace... some 50 years later they are mysteriously coming back, not having aged a day since 1963 and not knowing what happened to them - they just seem to pop back into reality. They are also provisioned and seem to each have been given a mission by someone. These criminals have to be caught quickly and ""under the radar"" (as how could their existence possibly be explained?  They were all ""officially"" dead, complete with death certificates etc. in the official records - and how do you explain the not aging?)So, there is an FBI agent (who used to be a guard at Alcatraz) with a secret team of helpers, the old shifty doctor from Alcatraz, an Asian woman shrink trying to catch and re-imprison them. [The Asian woman was evidently one of the first of the missing Alcatraz people to ""come back""]. They base their operation out of Alcatraz, in areas off limits to tourists.  They enlist the help of a female police detective (granddaughter to a key 1963 Alcatraz prisoner) who makes them also agree to a partner she picks. She picks a guy who is a comic book writer/illustrator, with a doctorate (he is something of a genius) who had written books on Alcatraz - the leading authority on everything Alcatraz. He seems to be the moral compass of the group, reminding the others that someday their task will be done and they will have to live with whatever they did.The episodes flow back and forth between showing Alcatraz in the early '60s and in the present, so you get background on things that were going on as well as back stories on each prisoner they're trying to catch, and what that prisoner is up to now. Usually focusing on 1 returned prisoner at a time, but towards the end of season 1 there are multiple in play at a time as the story builds.As long as you just go with it and not wonder if they were really allowed certain privileges or if the guards really behaved like that, or why this prisoner was at the prison for ""the worst of the worst"" instead of any other prison etc. it works. The stories/episodes are interesting and there are plenty of mysteries to be solved over time so the show held my interest.Decent story idea, decent scripts and acting - holds your interest.  Hopefully season 2 will be as good (on many shows, after a great first season, the writers get all squirrely and do not live up to the first season in my book) -- fingers crossed!  I'm looking forward to the solving of the mysteries.",Positive
"Warning!  Many spoilers!Additional Warning:  Thanks to Canadian and British television, the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world.  The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run, STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end.  Sorta.  Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works, so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time.  It is hard at this point to know what the show's legacy will be.  It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, FIREFLY, or even BABYLON 5 received, and one can't point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series, but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi.  Yeah, DR. WHO has been around longer, but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids' show (though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation).  It certainly did a number of things right.  The writing remained strong throughout.  The production values were strong from beginning to end.  And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments.  Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation.  Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy.  Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black (and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth--the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season) had children during that season.  I'm a huge fan of kids and having babies, but it doesn't mesh well with making TV shows.  Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle.  Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten.  Black's real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten, with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori.  Adria (played by Monica Baccarin, Inara from FIREFLY) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks.  Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet, who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother, hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala.  Although I have long been a fan of the show, I've long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast.  Though Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill was ever the wise cracker, there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O'Neill and Samantha Carter, no real romantic chemistry.  But Vala is really, truly funny and a real sex post as well.  And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell (which would have been expected, since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi, Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE).  Vala and Jackson are great together, with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson.  As a huge fan of Claudia Black's Aeryn Sun, who was a stern and serious character, it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show.  All in all, her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show.  If I have a regret with the series coming to an end, it is in not knowing what happens to her next.  In one of the most endearing touches of the season, the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team.  The season's opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate, but the week after she is allowed to join, just as the four start to walk through, Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori, a group of ultra religious fanatics.  With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news, with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran (readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with), nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten.  Samantha's father, who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok'ra, finally did die.  And not only Thor, but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge, epic, cliffhanging finales, the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet.  But also, I thought, remarkably appropriate.  I'm sure there was the temptation of a ""Big Ending,"" but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular, intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades.  The main five simply spend some time together, while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss.  Typically, they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end, with only Teal'c retaining any memory of the preceding decades.  As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways.  But we know the potential that remains.So, a classic series comes to an end.  It wasn't the best Sci-fi series ever.  It wasn't the most ground breaking.  And it isn't likely to be one of the more influential.  But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters.  Yeah, it had some unpleasant quirks.  It used ""Science as Magic"" to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself.  It reused plots endlessly.  I mean, just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need?  And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character?  (I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA's refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1.)  Still, the show took us to a host of wonderful places, introduced us to some wonderful enemies, and continually managed to entertain and delight.  And we got to know the core group of characters quite well.  Not many shows get ten seasons; even fewer manage ten seasons so well.  The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end, but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do:  last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end.",Positive

"I watched this without expectations. I mean, it's not actually a Jane Austen story. It's only a mash-up by the greatest stretch of that term. And -- cue the red flags and warning lights -- it's a mini-series.At this point, I think I've watched it at least 10 times. I absolutely LOVE this story, and the characters are wonderful. The casting is sublime.I will never look at Wickham in the same way, again. This is a wonderful spin on his character. In fact, this mini-series takes liberties with most of the characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Alex Kingston (River Song in Dr. Who) presents a wonderfully dimensional Mrs. Bennet. Hugh Bonneville as Mr. Bennet is charming and more sympathetic, as well.If there's any flaw in this, it's that it ended exactly where it should. While that may sound like &#34;where's the flaw...?&#34;, the fact is, I wanted to spend more time &#34;lost&#34; in Austen.Wonderful, and highly recommended for Jane Austen fans who aren't absolute purists about the sanctity of the original story.  This is an adventure for the young woman who falls into &#34;Pride and Prejudice,&#34; as well as the viewer.",Positive
"This is one great, non-stop action movie that can be actually watched more than once! Highly recommended. Not a big Jolie fan but in this, she neither under or over plays or acts. Of course, it is all predictable but I did not care, action so good and non-stop. Did I say ""non-stop""? If you have never seen, well worth a look on DVD, instant download.",Positive

"It has possibility but needs some editing and tightening of the writing.  The actors came across very nice , but I would wish to see less of the drug scene incorporated into the show, not needed.

It could be quite funny if handled right.",Negative

"I love this hilarious, surreal and very well-done film. It's hard to follow the plot (just as in the book), but it is all a heck of a lot of fun as David Wong (the author of the book's pseudonym and the main character in the book/film) and his wilder friend John accidentally trip there way into parallel universes that are accessible only to them after they are injected with a living drug known only as Soy Sauce. There are some confusing aspects, but a lot of the book had to be cut to keep the length of the film down to a reasonable level. The film contains lots of very good effects, especially considering its low budget. I love the two stars as they were perfect for this film. It's funny, kept me 100% interested, has a lot of bizarre twists, and a canine hero telepath. What more do you need for a great cult film that I hope has a sequel derived from author &#34;Wong&#34;'s second book.",Positive
"Despite loving sci-fi, I find these apocalyptic shows slow and tedious.  I always enjoy the pilots, but soon lose interest because we never seem to get satisfying answers and story lines to advance the main plot.  So, I am of course interested, but wary.  I really loved the X-Files until it was driven into the ground for the sake of trying to keep a hit show on the air despite losing David Duchovny.  I admire the shows that know when a story needs to be wrapped up (like Lost) and conclude while still on top.  I really hope that if this show gets picked up, it will not drag out the mystery and story lines beyond their shelf life.  I am definitely intrigued and want to know not only what is going on, but what will happen to some of the characters (not all, some are annoying).  So I did like it and I do see the potential in it.  Good pilot.",Positive
I Love Lucy is a timeless treasure.  It's what all sitcoms of today aspire to be. I can never get tired of enjoying the antics of the frowzy redhead and her friends.,Positive
"No matter how much time goes by, Gus and Shawn still attract the weirdest cases on TV. So unsurprisingly, ""Psych Season 4"" is just crammed with hilarious faux-psychic mysteries -- it gets a little dark in places and shows a few signs of wear and tear, but the rest of the season is full of werewolves, westerns and Bollywood. Well, not all in the same episode.A Vancouver ski vacation is interrupted when Shawn (James Roday) spots the brilliant art thief Pierre Despereaux, so now he and Gus (Dule Hill) must figure out a way to thwart the perfect crime. To make matters worse, Lassiter (Timothy Ormundson) is determined to capture Despereaux himself, since he's been after the thief for years.And back in Santa Barbara, the boys have a slew of other weird cases -- possible demonic possession, a murdered billionaire who asks Shawn to solve his murder, a haunted Wild West town, a drug lord, Gus' college a capella quartet, a soldier's mysterious death, a whitewater rafting disaster, tracking down Juliet's college boyfriend, a deadly virus, a shark attack, a Bollywood curse, and a man who believes he's a werewolf.On the darker side of things: Shawn ends up kidnapped by a thug during the course of a case, and must find a way to tell his friends where he is. And the gang is dragged into ANOTHER game of cat-and-mouse -- Mr Yin (""dance partner"" of the insane Yang) starts killing people in Hitchcockian style.""Psych Season Four"" is perhaps the most uneven season that this show has had thus far -- when it's good it's very VERY good, but a few of the episodes are kind of flawed (""Think Tank""). Fortunately, ""Psych"" at its worst is still a deliciously weird experience -- the writers are still exceptional at writing twisty-turny mysteries full of strange twists. AND we get to see Shawn biting a U.S. Marshal.It also has the usual ""Psych"" mix: hilarious dialogue (""My first instinct is beavers, but I'm not willing to rule out those pesky Keebler elves""), funny situations (Henry stuffing little Shawn in a car trunk, to the horror of their neighbor"") and increasingly strange cases that always turn out to be murder. Most of the season is comedy/light mystery, but the writers drop in a couple of more dramatic episodes -- and the finale is a brilliantly tangled web of murder, twisted trickery, and poignant loss.Roday's Shawn is a pop-culture Peter Pan -- charming, funny, weird and goofily immature, but he gets to show his serious, sadder side in the finale. We also see Shawn actually having a long-term relationship, and struggling to deal with the demands of a selfish girlfriend who doesn't seem to respect his work.Hill is amazing at being the ""normal"" guy who reins in Shawn's weirdness (while displaying a little of his own). And both Ormundson and Maggie Lawson get their time in the spotlight -- Lassiter gets sick of being overshadowed by Shawn and tries to solve a bizarre case the way Shawn would, and Juliet has to deal with her ex-boyfriend and brother being mixed up in crimes.""Psych Season Four"" has some rough spots, but it's still a delightful blend of mystery and comedy with the occasional spattering of darkness. Fun and crazy still.",Positive

"I'm well aware that American dad has its haters, and I don't always disagree with the criticisms.  However, I really think the show keeps improving, both in writing and comedic jokes.  To me this deserves recognition as most shows rely on the same tired formula and writing, which eventually gets lazy and repetitive (see the office).  American Dad has really tried to make itself a bit better as it grows, and this season shows it.  I'm not going to argue that its shakespeare, or the best comedy going, but I give credit where credit is due.  This volume made me laugh constantly, and unlike most american dad episodes, they didn't feel quite so disposable.  If you're a fan of american dad, its a no brainer, get it, you'll love it.

"I remember watching this.  It is off beat; a movie for your head.  If you like independent movies, you'll catch the drift maybe.Ghosts are everyday occurrences and are taken for granted by these people.  If the plot eludes you, you will probably havelots of company.",Negative
"The situations, the humor, the flat out willingness to resign all dignity and ego to create over the top characters for the sake of comedy makes this work a fun palate cleanser between weightier shows an life experiences.",Positive
A big Yawn. A standard police drama without an interesting hook. Titus Welliver is a wonderful actor that deserves stronger story lines.,Negative
"The Eclipse tells the story of Michael, a recent widower, as he begins to have disturbing visions of his nearly dead father-in-law. He shares his experiences with Lena, an author of supernatural stories. The Eclipse is a haunting supernatural drama.First, this is a drama with horror elements more than it is a pure horror film, so you should adjust your expectations if you were thinking differently. The story is, however, very creepy and haunting as it takes a more realistic approach in telling this ghost story. There are a few shocking jump-scares, but only a few. The film really tries to connect several characters and subplots, but that missed its point and hurts the film. In fact, I felt the story lacked direction and impact so some aspects were forgettable. The performances were good, nothing spectacular and nothing terrible - I think the cast was well-fitted for their roles. The music was excellent, eerily enchanting and often mesmerizing.Overall, The Eclipse has some decent horror/drama elements and a haunting soundtrack, but fails to leave an impact and is ultimately forgettable. As of 5/20/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, a rental is recommended.The Eclipse has some violence and blood. (not sure why this is Rated R).",Negative
Lost Girl Rocks! One of the best series ever! We love this program! 9 out of 10 stars! Yay! Yay! Yay!,Positive
"Reminded me a bit of &#34;Pete and Pete.&#34; My six year old found it a little, though. Would love to see more.",Positive
I liked the show enough to watch another episode before deciding if it will make into my list of watched shows.  The first show was busy introducing the characters and did not really have time to grab my attention.,Negative
"This film showcases the Shumway brothers' talents rather well, despite the stilted acting and beyond cliche story.  With better writers and actors, these guys could make some wonderful stuff.",Negative
The kids enjoy it and it has moments of some educational material.,Positive
"I sat down and watched all three available episodes in one go, I was that taken by this show. Come on, what could be funnier than four sleazy, self absorbed politicians living together in the equivalent of a college dorm room? The humour is often subtle, like when the senators are going out the door to work and one pauses to pick up an American flag lapel ping from a bowl full of pins conveniently located like a bowl of mints at a restaurant. A lot of reviewers are panning it because they see it as a snide liberal attack on conservatives. Well, I'm a conservative and I still found it funny, just as I often found Garry Trudeau's pseudo-socialist nattering in Doonesbury funny. It may slip into a left-wing hatefest eventually, but for now I find it refreshing--I'd rather hangout with these guys than four real Washington lowlifes.",Positive
interesting story with engaging sub plots and very good acting. fun to watch and look forward to the next episode.,Positive
Dirty Jobs is always enjoyable to watch - entertaining and educational.  Mike Rowe and his crew work really great together and really make watching the show fun.,Positive

"I love this show. I enjoy seeing familiar products being made. I find it brings back some great memories of long gone food labels, etc.Highly recommend it! The shows are about 20 minutes so you can fit a program or two into your day.",Positive
"I remember seeing this advertised for like 20 minutes before disappearing forever.  I assumed, going in, that it was gonna be a complete trainwreck.I was greeted with a surprisingly watchable movie.  Somewhat ordinary story - general-guy has an army doing stuff, hero has been captured.  Hero escapes - general-guy gets captured.  Hero guy goes to save general guy.  You've seen &#34;this movie&#34; before.The action was entertaining though.  I make no claim to knowing historical accuracy one way or another, but my uninformed self found the fighting scenes plenty authentic and fun to watch.  Cast of characters was rather forgettable save the hero, and the love interest...who surprisingly doesn't make it into the movie until the final few minutes.It was way better than Immortals.  Then again, so are things I've cleaned off of the bottom of my shoe.",Positive
"This is not a contest of who is the better English Professor.  Sorry....Hell's Kitchen this year I think is very different in some ways and the same in others....In past years, and I have seen every season, and own every season, You can a lot of times see who might get to be in the final four, if a little harder maybe the final six.  This year, the cast of chef's are so different, I can honestly say it is really fun to see who will start to emerge as a front runner.  Usually you can tell at least one person by now who might be there near the end. Not this season.  They all seem to be chef's without a clue!  lol  Which I love by the way.  The Personalities are very vast and it makes for interesting television. Now I believe in many seasons they make the guys seem to be a bit nuts where ""their lights are on but nobody's home"".....Well there has been a shift in the last few years where the woman are now the ones who are clearly off their rocker.....This is not a put down.  It is simply good television and fun to watch.  Also, this season, they are not pushing sex as much which honestly, I am glad about. Every show usually has sex in it, or eye candy for men and woman.  This season, it is just about the best Chef for the Grand Prize, which is working directly for Gordon Ramsay himself.  This is not for another restaurant, this is a direct executive position working for Gordon Ramsay.  And of course the first year salary of 250,000 dollars.  But this is only for the first year.  Now, the challenges are similar, some of the guest Chef's are similar, and the one thing I do like is that Gordon Ramsay does seem to do something good for our troops in different branches of our armed services.  No matter what our political views are, I think we can agree it's nice that they give the troops a nice treat by feeding them and thanking them, and celebrating the sacrifices they give up.  Gordon is as explosive as ever and maybe going for a record in throwing people out of the kitchen.  There is more lying and back stabbing going on with the contestants. In the end, as it is more of the same, it is every much that different.  Gordon was giving an interview about the contestants and asked what he thought.  I have to preface this by saying people who do not know the show have a tendency of saying ""they make the same food all the time and it's not different"".  Well, that is true to a degree.  Gordon said ""they come in thinking they practiced the dishes before they enter the contest and they think it will be easy.""  Gordon laughed.  The truth is, learning how to make the fine dining food, and perfecting it, and putting it out perfect while on the line every single time, is almost impossible to do.  The two left that can do it the best and adjust the quickest fight for the title.  Also, they do not make the same exact food every night. There are many nights where they do different types of food from comfort food, children's food, to different cultural types of cuisine, and then finally right down to breakfast and burgers......Hell's Kitchen has everything.  And by the way they were just signed for season 12 and 13.  Hell's Kitchen is also in primetime up against other good shows, and it has been compared to Top Chef, which is on cable tv, and has not been on as long as Hell's kitchen and has not been signed for the type of extension that Hell's Kitchen has been.  I feel Hell's kitchen is as fresh as it's ever been and as fun as it's ever been.  And this season is great because they are all a bit eclectic and from all walks of life, and so far there is nobody who looks like they can cook!!!  lol lol  So it will be fun to watch them evolve as they get to the finals.  If you like Hell's Kitchen, You should take the time to watch.  You just cant go wrong.  It has everything....Just a side note, Masterchef is doing well, kitchen nightmares was also resigned, and we have ""Hotel Hell"" to look forward to as we head into July.  Enjoy everyone...Also, if you really want to understand the man himself, Gordon Ramsay, get both his books about his life.  You can get them for less than two dollars. And that will change the way you view this man forever.  He truly is an amazing hard working man.  And more importantly, a great family man.",Positive
"great show , the network is lame to shut it down. so get the word out and lets keep this on the air",Positive
Wish they would have more shows like this. Networks have moved away from si-Fi for some reason. Nothing on network TV worth watching.,Positive
What a great third season. As usual I had a difficult time cutting it off when I could go on to another episode.  It was a realistic and great ending to a really good series.,Positive
I am so glad we stumbled upon this series. My kids love animals and the show blends educational and entertainment content effortlessly.  I actually enjoy sitting with them and watching it.... learning new things as well!,Positive
"There are no words. Episode 1. It will make you want to clean your house so hard! Episode 8 I actually watched 3 X because I wanted to share it with so many people and you just can't not watch it.... over and over and over.....one would think that the fact that someone has a puddle of dead cat juice in their fridge would be sign enough that they have some issues and they wouldn't need a television crew and a team of experts to clue them in, but equally sick is that I'M GLAD THEY DO!",Positive
"If it's possible to be fascinated by a movie and confused by it at the same time, that was my reaction to ""How I Live Now."" You can find out the plot by reading most of the reviews, but I'll say the things that struck me are the attention to making the world seem like a children's playground before the war begins. That makes the nightmare that follows all the more significant. And I was truly grateful to see the lead actress make a transformation from annoying to caring in the film. (Boy, was she grating in the first 20 minutes.) This is one of those movies that will leave you thinking a lot of ""what ifs"" and maybe that's the point. The confusing part is you never actually know who are the bad guys in this movie. This includes whether the government is inflicting violence on its own people.",Positive
"And they're off, with all the characters that we've come to know and love, and hate.The second season starts off where the first one ended, so I'd really recommend watching them in order.This show is so perfectly presented with the whole feel of the time and the characters well acted, it's surprisingly good, quality for a tv series.It takes it's us into the era with attention to detail and makes no apology for the blood and violence of the time.Looks like this show is going from strength to strength - really hope it continues in the same vain.",Positive
"If you're wondering what the hell my review has to with polar bears, you're either a Kevin Smith fan and immediately get it, or you're scratching your head wondering how that makes any sense.  Que up this show, and you wind up feeling exactly the same way, Denise Patterson's review summed up everything that I would've stated myself as to why this show was concocted by a bunch of nitwits.  Characters  you absolutely hope will die asap because that alone will increase the global IQ rating (except for Dee, the streetsmart black ex-con).  People rushing around aimlessly and having less than zero common sense, and the list of insulting (of the viewer's intelligence) goes on for a very long time.The ending features a undefined and unusual creature, perhaps a demon that's supposed to hook everyone, but sadly everything that led up to that point was so poorly assembled that one has no reason to waste another hour of one's life watching more of the same.  High school student plays are put together better, seriously this is just flat out awful.  My only sympathy goes to the actors and staff employed by this title, sorry to say but your agents should get fired for putting you into such a travesty of a show.",Negative
"I was really surprised by this movie.  Admittedly I rented it just to kill time, but it turned out to be really cool.  It is filmed similarly too Blair Witch, though this one didn't make me seasick.  It's about a group of students who confront a man accused of poaching bears in Norway, only to find out he actually works for the Norwegian government tracking trolls.  The story line was very inventive.  The effects were pretty good and keep it above an average B movie.  The acting was really good, and the twist at the end was great too.  If you can bare subtitles (part of the film is in english too) and like monster type movies, you'll probably like this film.",Positive
"Another great episode ... hmmmm,  wonder who's up in the bedroom with Senator Andy?! Can't wait to find out. This is a great inaugural series for Amazon.",Positive
"This is full of beautiful scenery, interesting people, and lovely(and not so loverly} louses in other countries.  fun to try to guess which house the people will take.",Positive
"As a classical music lover, one who is well-informed, I found this show to be a tasteless exaggeration of issues in the dying classical world. I was particularly put-off by Bernal's ridiculous appearance (I think a stab at Gustavo Dudamel) and at the misuse of the wonderful Malcolm MacDowell, who is made to over-enunciate, when I've seen him command the English language like a fine musical instrument in the past. I ca';t recommend that this show be picked up.",Negative
"entertaining,it amazes me how the lie keeps on getting covered and uncovered.not many dull moments in this series and it is good to watch some of my favorite actors in earlier roles.",Positive
"This show has a few things going for it. Piper Perabo (playing the principle character: 'Annie' Walker) is very sexy, and the producers aren't afraid to show her in some sexy clothing and poses that make me... Christopher Gorham (playing 'Augie' Anderson) is also quite sexy (for the ladies) and once again the revealing outfits and workout scenes are abundant. The costumes, locations, sets and props are superb. It's a very stylish show, with high production value. The music (especially the title track by Flint Eastwood) is killer and the overall production value superb.  The problem with this show? The writing; specifically the portrayal of the CIA (and other intelligence agencies). The show routinely shows CIA agents conducting covert ops inside the U.S., targeting U.S. persons for ops, breaking various laws, acting in irresponsible and illegal ways. Their interaction with other intelligence agencies is always competitive, antagonistic and marked by direct competition. The ignorance (or is it disinformation?) regarding U.S. intelligence agencies (do five minutes of research on Google, why don't you?!) is disturbing, insulting, and distracting. The acting ranges from fair to downright abysmal - If Christopher Gorham is supposed to play a blind person why is he constantly dodging furniture, doorways and objects directly in his path? Is the director awake during the shoot? I don't think I'll make it beyond season two. It's fun to watch for a season or two (I saw season one as well), but ultimately this show will run out of steam.",Negative
"Not bad for a low budget film. I found myself getting mad at the weakling for being such a wimp. Guess that is why I would give it 3 stars. This movie could have had more action and close calls. Don't expect ""The Walking Dead"" type action.",Negative
I dislike jokes that slander Christianity.  Showing a picture of Jesus on the cross and telling someone to get a closeup of the bulge.  If you did anything like that to any other belief system you would be characterized as a bigot and you might even be fired for it.  Not so if your bigotry is aimed at Christianity.  There is an American Pastor imprisoned in Iran who has been sentenced to 8 years in that prison because he tried to bring a message of love instead of hate to that country.  They are torturing him for that.  He will probably die in that prison at the hands of his torturers.  There are reports that he is bleeding internally from constant beatings but the Iranians wont get him a doctor.  So whoever wrote this crap that is supposed to be funny is a Christian bigot. I'm sure your very proud of yourself.,Negative
My x-wife wanted to see it so we got the chips and dips and gave it a go. Nice scenery and thrilling tale. Excellent gladiator fights. Cool volcano explosions and computer graphics work.,Positive
The plot moves slowly and the characters aren't that compelling. I go back to this series from time to time to &#34;cleanse my palate&#34; so to say.,Negative
"For those of us that believe in alien cultures this is the show to watch, let alone discover places on Earth I never knew existed.",Positive
I missed this series when it was on network tv.  It is nice to be able to watch it without commercials.  Thank you for making it available.,Positive
"Love how funny they are and how entertaining. It doesn't matter if I have seen this episode before or not, always catches my attention and always keeps me entertained.",Positive
Such a fun show for the kids to watch. It keeps them entertained and teaches them a few things too!,Positive
I've watched all of the Foyle series and have become a true fan of all the characters. The timeframe of WW II and the civil problems faced by the English are very interesting.,Positive
Mary and Marshall Marshal have been hiding those people so well for years now. Love the series and the interaction between characters.,Positive

"This is one series I waited PATIENTLY for it to premiere.  And it was not in the least, a disappointed!  I love, love, love the Holden character.  He just give this certain life to the show and is an uplift to Linden's character.  I am happy!  Oh gosh... happy is my middle name when it comes to this series... eeek!!!!Totally recommend!",Positive
"Seasons 1-6, I'd give this series 5 stars easy.Granted you had to turn your brain off on certain aspects of it, but the shows in general were crafted quite well, if unbelievable.  The characters were likeable and the series took chance;  many of those chances I didn't really agree on, but still it moved the plot forward.I mean seriously malware delivered as a fractal pattern etched on the end of a bone that is scanned in and causes a whole data centers fans to shut down?I'm lucky to get a 2D object scanned in at 300 dpi, let alone have the scanning software trigger some sort of data center cascade.This last series, isn't bad per se, but seems like they are coasting quite a bit.  Humor isn't quite there, plot lines are of the single episode variety (no season wide big bad).I still watch it, hopefully, but to date, mildly entertaining at best.",Negative
As always a stellar season of Burn Notice. I really did like the ending especially with the lines from the first show being used. And the ending for Michael's mom was so Maddy. Love it and will miss it.,Positive
"OMG this is the best show ever. It's unabashed political satire is genius. I love all the characters, every single one them are interesting! If this a truth of what it's like inside Congress, I want to be on its staff!!!",Positive
Very enjoyable season but the writers painted themselves in a corner and could not come up with a climatic ending. The entire season was interesting but that last episode is not justified.,Positive
"I find Grimm to be fun and entertaining.  Love all of the characters, they are funky and lovable.  The wesen are not all that fun, but it is a detective show, after all and there are good people too.",Positive
I liked it because there were many celebrities that I did not know that totally did some weird schuff!! Weird!,Positive
"The season 2 finale and season 3 opener featuring the zombie master were, in my opinion, a little disappointing if not downright campy however episode two of the current season sets the stage for a decidedly different turn of events.  What fans are being treated to is nothing short of an expanding universe as other legendary creatures, not necessarily Wesen, are introduced along with hints of Nick's deadlier powers and darker persona.  Everyone's favorite Blutbad (i.e. Monroe) continues to be an active consultant helping to lighten the mood but with a decidedly larger emphasis on his own story while the European intrigue sub-plot continues to become a more substantial and thankfully more interesting part of the overall series.Horror lovers will be pleased with the look and feel that Grimm continues to cultivate and given that it precedes ""Dracula"" on Friday evening is helping to give NBC a reputation as the place to go for legitimate, creepy thrills.  If you can't wait till season 3 is released on DVD but don't care for the commercials associated with television, then buy a season pass (includes a slight discount) on Amazon and you can watch new episodes that premiere Friday evening on Saturday morning.  :o)",Positive
"COULD NOT WAIT TO START LAST SEASON OF PRISON BREAK.  WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE JUSTICE HAS PREVAILED HOWEVER, THE CONCLUSION OF SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SEASON LEFT ME DEPRESSED FOR WEEKS. :(",Positive

"After all this time, it was great to finally see the beginning episodes of this wonderful show and to see some of my favorite episodes again!",Positive
"Another season with the trials, tribulations, and victories in the wild and the bush of America.  Love this series and can't wait till the next season comes out.",Positive
"While it isn't my favorite season, I'm still happy to have it on Amazon.  I'm looking forward to next season though!  I think my favorite episode was where they talked about how to cook eggs.  I have found that this method is superior to the dried out eggs I have cooked in the past.  I suppose you don't know what you don't know.",Positive
I really loved it all.  The ending was a huge surprise that left me thinking this could be really great or really bad at some point but consider me SUPER intrigued and wanting more.,Positive
"My wife and I found this movie to be quite boring.  The acting was OK, but the author left something to be desired.",Negative
I really find ALL the series interesting and my son and his girlfriend are watching the series!!!!!  I will be view all the rest of series shortly! Thanks,Positive
I had enjoyed the Closer. I have always liked Mary McDonnell. She did a great job in making the transition from antagonist to protagonist.,Positive

"this is a film with excellent acting and noble intentions, and tells an almost mythical tale of a woman's rise and fall and redemption. the astonishing thing is that the story is real, and we're shown the costumes and sets, excerpts from newscasts and television shows, musical hits of the era to prove it. what's sorely missing, however, especially for viewers born after 1970, is a depiction of the historical predicament of women in the years of early feminism. when two police officers interrupt an abusive episode between lovelace and her husband, and she fails to ask for help, one officer actually asks her for her autograph. the scene doesn't read right unless the viewer is aware that the duty of police to intervene in domestic disputes was not established by law at the time and wouldn't seem to the officers the ""correct"" thing to do; she wouldn't ask for help knowing those facts. worse, there is no reference to contemporary feminist developments, even though the meager plot of ""deep throat"" turns on its heroine's demand that she enjoy sex as much as men.without being lurid, the film dissects the depravity of an abusive marriage, the husband alternating between affection and violence. because this is the part of an abused woman's life often hidden from outsiders, the film tells a large arc of the linda lovelace story ""from the outside"", as served up by the film publicity events, then reprises the key scenes with ""the rest of the story"" -- how each of them turned violent or degrading or manipulative. a judgmental mother and ineffectual father fail to help her; she doesn't reach out to her closest friends; investors only see her as a product ... which leaves her husband chuck traynor to use her however he pleases. the mystery is why she put up with it so long -- for that you have to look to the expectations placed on her by her mother and her catholic upbringing, the coercion and threats from her husband, the allurements of fame, but most of all her naive compulsion to please and be loved.the principals are excellent. peter sarsgaard is almost satanic as the slimy, manipulative, cynical and cowardly husband, cruel to his wife and fawning to men with money, and there's a fine supporting cast to play the pygmies of the porn industry. a scene near the end, when lovelace's parents see her phil donohue interview on TV and finally grasp what their daughter has suffered and their complicity in her affliction, is sad and very powerful. amanda seyfried is convincing where innocence and earnestness are called for, and her natural sweetness comes through in many scenes, but lovelace's real pain is fully revealed only once, in a late night plea to her mother for shelter, and it comes before we see much of the abuse she suffers and seems unmotivated as we watch it. (a later rape scene is also presented without sufficient buildup, so it is shocking but less painful to watch than it should be.) at other moments of desperation or despair, seyfried seems bewildered, as if unsure what the two directors wanted from her -- more likely they were unsure themselves, or how they should handle the script. despite all that, seyfried and sarsgaard give gutsy, ambitious and engrossing performances.",Positive
Duck Dynasty is a great family fun television show to watch!! It is good ole clean FUN!!!! I absolutely love it!!!,Positive

"------------------------------------------------""Roadie""(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2012)------------------------------------------------Ron Eldard shines as the lead in this indie film, playing Jimmy Testagros, a working-class lug from Queens, NY who is brought down to earth after having spent twenty-six years as a roadie for his all-time favorite rock band, and then getting fired and having to confront the emptiness of a life spent on the move. Down on his luck, he heads back to his hometown and the cold comfort of his rock-poster filled room in his widowed mother's house. Bobby Cannavale plays his dramatic foil, a former high school bully whose grown up into a jerky, loudmouthed adult who lures Jimmy back into the same humiliating, imbalanced power dynamic that divided them as teens. Cannavale's character generates heat in the script but is a little overstated -- his jerkiness is explained by his being a cokehead, but it's still a bit much. A more subtle performance comes from veteran character actor Lois Smith, who plays Jimmy's half-senile mother, and whose subtle reactions and keen appraisal of her son's failings gives the film real kick.  Eldard's Jimmy -- mopey, charming, transparent and forlorn -- is a compelling character, likable though pathetic, a guy who's bottoming out yet remains charismatic and attractive despite his all-too apparent failings. This is a movie about accepting people with all their flaws, which is a message I appreciate -- it might be a little too depressing or one-note for many viewers, but it's definitely worth checking out. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",Positive
Some very strong character development from all the actors. It is a pleasure to watch something that doesn't bill itself as &#34;reality TV&#34; yet continues to make me believe in what's happening.  Keep up the good work!,Positive
bloody fantastic! why isn't this on regular television? I'd be watching whenever it came on. if the powers that be did that- they'd have to keep the same cast. bloody enjoyable.,Positive

"I was kind of skeptical, mainly because I really liked Christopher Eccleston in Season 1, but Season 2 was no disappointment.",Positive
"This was on of the best if not the best movies that I've seen to come from Spain. Just about every element of this movie was crafted with loving hands that put the finishing touches on each and every scene before you and I would ever see it. The acting from Laura  played by (Rueda) was very good as her emotions changed from a loving mother to a panicked, distraught woman on the edge after the disappearance of her son Sim'on. The other case members also give good performances, but Rueda is the standout in this movie. The director worked magic with his cast and crew to bring this story to life from the beautiful orphanage remodeled into the families home. The cinematography was noting short of spectactular from inside the home to the beach and cave to the shots in town where the accident occurs. The mood was thick enough to cut with a knife and is so seldom seen in movies of this genre where mood can make or break a movie. The writer and director were able to turn words into this increadible work of visual and audio art. My only real issues with this movie is it seemed to drag a bit at times and the tension buildup was not always rewarding or paid off (ok we heard that but?). I would have liked to of seen more from the ghosts prespectives than was shown. I don't need tons of cgi or gore to make a story good, but I do need payment and thats where this looses a few points. Did it ruin the story/movie? Not at all. It was just not as exciting/terrifying as it could have been. What happens to their child is a good and bad twist to the story and again kind of a let down after all that happens to the family and especially to Laura.Rating 0 to 5Story = 4Acting = 4+Direction = 4+Mood = 4+Fear/Chreepy Factor = 3.3Gore = 2 One scene was gorySex/Nudity= No/NoEntertainment Value = 4++",Positive
Enjoy the cast and how they relate to one another in the script.. Keep up the good work this next season..,Positive
"Quote from Michelle Simms:  ""Oh little one, I have done all that you have done or shall do. Thought of all you've thought or shall think. I am all knowing; I am Michelle.""This is a show of Michelle Simms (Sutton Foster), a has-been Broadway girl performing in Vegas where she is swept away by Hubbell Flowers (played by Alan Ruck).  This actress is quite talented.  And I love that the character's name is Michelle.  My family and I even joke about how we both have the same name.When I first watched this it was because it was by the same producers ofGilmore Girls: The Complete First Season (Digipack).  But now that I'm hooked on just the show, I've forgotten about the producers.  And up until now, I didn't pay attention to the actress that played Fanny Flowers.  I didn't compare or think of Kelly Bishop as the same person of Emily Gilmore from ""Gilmore Girls.""These actresses stand alone just as this show does.  It's not ""Gilmore Girls"" at all.

"Rome has clearly inspired Showtime to produce this miniseries in 10 one hour parts, portraying Henry VIII's more youthful and vigorous days.  The timespan is a small one, from his growing discontentment with Catherine of Aragon, to consummating his love for Anne Boleyn... so we only get to wife number 2 - plenty of scope for sequels, but did leave me with a bit of frustration at times wanting to see a little more resolved.As it is, the key players here are Henry VIII, in his low 20's, fighting fit and clearly horny (there are some fairly explicit scenes towards the beginning of the season).. Cardinal Wolsey (played with great presence by Sam Neill) the corrupt but efficient First Minister, and Sir Thomas More, the fervent Catholic and conscientious humanist.The series thrives on a combination of terrific performances, well written screenplay and flawlessly depicted Tudor atmosphere of the Court.It falls short of Rome's success by failing to have a counterpoint to the Royal drama - the scenes of `Real' England, the bars and backstreets, are only rarely seen, but could be considered vital to understanding the England of the times.  Having some lowly characters in situations of poverty, may well have helped accentuate the drama.Having said that, and despite a few forgivable departures from history, this works well as a refresher on Tudor history, and is a first at seeing Henry VIII in his prime as a real human being.Kudos to Showtime, and I await the next series with bated breath..Extras are modest, but rewarding - a couple of 5 minute featurettes on costume and sets, and a lengthier one with a tour guide taking us round the real Tudor historic sights in London, all moderately interesting.  A documentary depicting the real history may have also been a welcome addition, but is lacking.Also included are first episodes on some other Showtime series - a cunning plan, and a welcome one.",Positive
"We love NCIS and for some reason, we did not watch it when it started on TV.  Later when we discovered it we wanted to start watching it from the beginning.",Positive
some of the episodes were great others  were so so.The wizard of oz take off was too much for me.,Negative
I have to be admit the show reminded me of college days and behaviors in the 60's among the theater and music students; behaviors which carried over into the real world of competitions and auditions where everyone was hungry to prove themselves and get a position with a professional company. Although this is a comedy there is some life imitating art here. A very good cast overall and a premise that has been explored before but not with as much intensity.,Positive
"Wonderful series, found it by accident, after seeing an advertisement for season 2. Had read As the Crow Flies in my reading group and really enjoy the book  So decided to start watching this series and fell in love with the very first episode.  Wonderful set of characters.  Enjoying every episode",Positive
It reminds me of a Bob Newhart type of show. There is one character that knows what is going on and he's surrounded by people who don't. Some interesting episodes that mix drama a d comedy.,Positive
I have to keep watching one after another they keep you so interested.  I love the funny things that just pop in every once or so,Positive
Good show so far.We are on episode 6.Wondering how they think sometimes though.There are alot of common sense things they just don't do or think of.,Positive
"TV feels inundated with sitcoms, but Modern Family manages to rise about most of the crowd with its interesting characters and unique brand of humor.  From the opening episode I was hooked, with each of the three families being followed offering a different 'feel' but each being equally funny.  The show follows a format of three separate storylines in most episodes, which it usually manages to tie together in the end with some kind of unified theme.  It is an interesting format, and the writers have really made it work.Season 4 is well worth checking out if you were a fan of the previous season.  The families manage to grow and adapt just enough to keep their characters interesting, but without hurting the original formula that makes the show work.",Positive
"Feels a bit familiar, but very viewable. I think it's an enjoyable series, nothing scary, a bit of humor, good for late night viewing.",Positive
"Terrorist, plague, aliens, zombies? After being trapped with a group of people in a parking garage the lady who escapes finds herself standing in the middle of hundreds of people running in all directions? From what? Where are they going? Why are some running this way and some running that way? She doesn't ask. Her only concern is to get back to her hotel room to get her cell phone. The lady in question is the best of the group - acting wise - and deserves a better script. There are a few good moments but not enough to keep me interested.",Negative
"As a fully animated series, this show has the potential to be a lot of fun.  However, I feel as if this show was written by a Scott Adam wannabe satirist that cobbled together plot points from Tripping the Rift and Farscape.  Successful animated series such as The Simpsons and Family Guy are able to seamlessly merge low-brow, slapstick humor with modern day references and politically incorrect subject matter.  Dark Minions has the potential to push the envelope of ""The Office""-style comedy by utilizing the animated stage and the open-ended environment of science fiction.  I will be watching the next episodes.  Good luck.",Negative
"I get so wrapped up in the story I can begin to get emotional over some scenes, until I remind myself that they are all acting, very , very, good acting I admit. But still it is just a story, and what a great story it is. Great actors, great story, great time watching. Love upstairs downstairs. Love British programs.",Positive
I love this show. China was'nt one of my favorite seasons but it was good all the same. I bought it well worth ten bucks.,Positive
I am really going to miss Justified when it goes off the air following the sixth season. It is absolutely the best show of it's time.,Positive
This movie was spectacular! I love the history. Stunning! If you are a fan of the three kingdoms era then this is a must watch.,Positive
"I used to enjoy Modern Marvels, then I realized that the narrator's voice was just soothing me to sleep at 3am, and that I needed to get back out into the world again and stop watching this annoying show.Except the cool ones where they build big ships and stuff like that. !!!!! If it is about jet-powered engines, or awesome fighter jets, or high-powered weapons, it's like, hey boyfriend, let's watch this. Otherwise, do you need to know? Really?There was kind of a Willy Wonka one where they made candy. That was cool. LOL! But seriously? More JET FIGHTER PLANES! That's like, what you need to know about. Also REALLY EXPENSIVE CARS like LAMBORGHINIS! Otherwise, don't bother watching, you'll fall asleep.",Negative
Typical short series kinda sci-fi. Worth the watch if your looking for something easy to watch and have time to kill.,Negative
"This show just gets better. The mystery of the Doctor's new companion makes for a compelling story arc and these episodes are packed with drama, excitement, and humor. And are more than a little mind-bending. All you can ask from Doctor Who.",Positive
"Castle and Beckett believe a murder case is linked to a storage locker. Castle bids and wins the storage locker and its contents, but only finds cheap trashy treasures. When Captain Victoria Gates sees Castle holding a rare porcelain doll that would complete her collection, he happily hands it over. Suddenly, the captain loves Rick and even buys a complete set of his books for him to autograph. Working through a list of suspects, the murder victim's employer's household and seemingly unrelated low lifes, the reason for murder and perpetrator is found. Unfortunately, resolving the murder costs Castle his new found friendship with the captain and she is back to hating him by the end of the episode. Very funny entry in the Castle cannon.",Positive
This version of Mansfield Park focused much more on the heroine and her final happy ending with marriage to the younger son. I have seen other versions which brought out some of the other subconflicts between the father and the eldest son who clash over the slavery issue on his father's overseas plantation. The schemes of the unfaithful married cousin to meet with her handsome lover are downplayed in this version as well. This version seems to gloss over the flaws and shortcomings of  many of the characters in the real version of Mansfield Park to make it more acceptable for television audiences. Enjoyable enough to watch.,Positive
I love this show. It is one of the best shows out there in my opinion. It is like the new &#34;Friends&#34;,Positive
"I decided to finally check this show out during the weekend the first season became available on Amazon Prime. WOW! I immediately bought and downloaded the second season because it was so fantastic. If you're a Buffy fan, you will LOVE this show. Many of the elements are very similar, which shouldn't be surprising because I think the creator of this show is a former Buffy writer. However it doesn't feel like a retread. It feels fresh and fun. When this show debuted, another fairy-tale inspired show also bowed. I felt like I could only devote time to one of them, and for some reason I was drawn to the other based on early descriptions. I made a big mistake. Grimm blows that other fairy-tale show out of the water. I'm almost done with this season, but I don't want it to end.",Positive
I ordered this before I realized it is a video comic. I am not a fan of video/digital comics and this is the reason for the low rating.  I did not finish watching it when I realized what it is.,Negative
This season I really like because Scott is an Alpha now and he has stepped up to defend the people in his town and the people in his pack. Thanks,Positive
"Over at `The Film Experience', Nathanial Rogers (possibly the best Oscar internet blogger out there) has been posting a ""Best In Show"" column for certain actors (or actresses) in films and while watching `Two Lovers' I felt inspired to write my own.When considering the film `Two Lovers', first time viewers may immediately suspect that the two Oscar names (Joaquin Phoenix and Gwyneth Paltrow) would be the obvious choices for `best is show' praise, but upon the actual viewing it is apparent that there is one performance so subtle yet so alarmingly in tune with her character that one cannot help but obsess over her.Yes, I'm talking about Vinessa Shaw.Vinessa plays Sandra, a young and kind hearted woman who seeks out a relationship with Leonard.  Sandra's father has recently conducted a business merger with Leonard's father, and after a brief observance (Sandra sees Leonard asking his mother to dance while at work) she asks her father to set up a meeting between them.  She thinks he is cute.  Leonard has problems (serious ones that involve the cancellation of a wedding and multiple suicide attempts) but these are aspects of his tortured soul that intrigue Sandra.  She wants to help him, to heal him.When they first meet her candor is endearing.  She is not as shy or reclusive as Leonard, but she has a natural unnaturalness about her demeanor.  When she feels that maybe her advances are not being met with approval she immediately recants, pulling back and apologizing for him, basically telling him not to worry about not wanting to `date' her until he leans in and kisses her and she is consumed.""Oh my god.""  Those were her words.  She utters that phrase twice in the film and both times carry so much internal weight.As their relationship grows you can see a spark in Sandra, but that spark is corroded by a `knowing', a sixth sense if you will, that something is not right.  When Leonard is getting strange phone calls and becoming more and more reclusive, pulling away yet never saying what it is that is truly on his mind, you can see that Sandra knows, but she is unwilling to confront it for fear of losing him.  She doesn't want it to be real.That's why the second ""oh my god"" carries so much weight, because you can tell that she isn't quite sure she believes her own eyes.While `Two Lovers' is, sadly, more about one lover (that lover being Michelle, the generically clich&eacute;d `troubled girl'), the one who stays with you through every frame is Sandra.  Sure, she is vanilla while Michelle (Leonard's drug addicted neighbor who is shacking up with a married man and almost instantaneously becomes Leonard's sole obsession) is certainly not, but the textural approach that Shaw took to this character makes her scream to life.  She understands how to make Sandra's love for Leonard seem real and sincere.Now that I've devoted much of my praise to a singular performer, I guess I should weigh in on the movie itself.  While I found it stirring and most defiantly engaging, there are things about `Two Lovers' that felt off kilter.  Leonard as a character is a little two unstable and underdeveloped.  We know there is tragedy there, and Phoenix does a remarkable job of balancing his characters `new life' with the `old one' (this is far from a melodramatic downer), but the script doesn't really allow for us to KNOW who Leonard really is or understand why these women are so into him.  I felt that shifting focus to the relationship between Leonard and Michelle was a mistake, for the real emotional crux of the film is between Leonard and Sandra.  The ending, while not surprising (I totally saw that coming) can read a little false, but it also was one of those moments where, upon reflection, probably says more about Leonard as a person than any other moment in the film.He doesn't really know what he wants.The film is flawed, but it is also memorable.  It is quiet yet it has moments that sting and stay with you.  It also has Shaw.  Oh how I weep for her lack of awards attention last year.",Positive
Grimmer season.  There is more determination from the characters.  The plot is developed further and the charactersInteract and grow.,Positive
"When Castle first aired, it was fresh, funny, and fanciful (a novelist who brought his writer's imagination to the case). I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars then. It is still an enjoyable and entertaining show, but there is less emphasis on the writer's skills, less interaction with his daughter and mother (which was truly fun to watch), the writing is not always fresh at this point--something any television show has to struggle with after several seasons. The way the murders are solved is a bit predictable--the first suspects are never the killer. However, we keep watching because there is still a good deal of character development for the ensemble cast; there are still surprising plot twists and continuing story lines, and in the end we really like the actors and the characters they play.",Negative
"Great show. Well written, well performed. I was worried it was going to be like Glee but it's got a much more complex story line. Well worth watching.",Positive
"A smart, unpredictable story with an intriguing, unusual political perspective. A period piece set in America during the cold war, the story is told by two soviet spys living in Washington, D.C. with their (unaware) children. In the mold of other anti-heroes stories (Breaking Bad), the show actually compells you to root for the Russians. Hard to imagine but entirely true. Good (although sometimes uneven) acting, hilariously accurate period costumes and a bold dash of edge of your seat tension, intruque and restrained (but still shocking) violence make this a good show to watch, even for snobby intellectuals. Highly recommended.",Positive
I love the lying game each episode had a suprise revealed. I missed the 5th season I think where her step sister is suppose to help the other twin investigate.,Positive
This show is genuinely scary with a excellent plot and great actor's. Very well written and thought provoking. Every episode slaps you in the face with a viewpoint you have never considered.,Positive
Great!! I grew up on blue and now my child can do the same and loves it. Classic. Educational. Good family time,Positive
Only two episodes in it  is interesting.  I really don't have high expectations of network television but this could be an interesting concept with  good writing just have to hold out and see.,Negative
Old as I am it astonished me that Julia Child was making cooking shows while I was still in high school.  The early programs are in black and white with minimal production values to put it nicely.  This adds to the charm of the show for me though.  Good food has changed a lot since the days when French cooking reigned supreme.  Today's emphasis on the best and freshest ingredients and simple preparation contrasts with Julia's substantial preparation efforts.  It's fun to watch what it was like to cook Julia style.,Positive

"I have really liked this series from the start. It has definitely gotten darker over time, and it appears as though this new season will continue that trend. But all the main characters are all back and the ensemble continues to act very well and project believable personas, no matter how unrealistic the plots.",Positive
"I am totally enthralled by this show, although it may be not quite reality and is perhaps a bit staged.  I have enjoyed learning more about the real estate business and seeing the beautiful homes in Malibu and other parts of Los Angeles.  I like the three brokers also, although initially I only liked one of them.  I find Josh Flagg to be particularly fascinating.  He is a genuine eccentric and at a rather young age.  I have to say I prefer this to all other real estate programs.",Positive
"Season 1 still got me watching and still watching cos amazons is awesome, stop watching tv but paying to watch this show;)",Negative
Great show if you like Nathan Fillion.  It is infused with his sense of humor and fun and some pretty interesting mysteries as well.,Positive
"This show has room to expand, room to grow. Chlo Sevigny plays her character with the right amount of emotion without overly displaying her dark secrets. A fan of her work, this is the sort of role at which she excels. Just wish Amazon would put up the latest episode and keep the interest level going. Has the feel of a solid long run production. More, please.",Positive
Great wee stories and great morals. Highly recommend! My 2 year old and 7 year old and I all agree :),Positive
I like it it's not as funny as i thought but it's still good it's one of those shows that will progress as it goes on and funnier episodes will follow,Negative
"I find the acting is great and the story is powerful. This zombie drama has me and my family glued to the tv every week wanting to find out what is next and worrying about the family of survivers. If you have a strong stomach and don't get nightmares from horror movies, I highly recommend this.",Positive
I have watched many vampire movies and series but this one is good because it shows a 'human' side to the characters. They may be vampires but they are family.,Positive
"From strippers, the office mishaps, to weed, and more weed, to Dirk not getting that he's lamer (yes I made that word up....I think?) than the rest of the crew. To beer and parties, I don't know what isn't to like about this season. Expect more of the same, times eighty. Because yea gotta be fresh.",Positive
I also enjoyed the original.  They have done a good job of being creative with the story in this re-make.,Positive
"I really enjoy season 9, the characters are well developed and the story lines more realistic. Good acting, good fun!",Positive
"FX has some great programming on it but Justified is by far the best show on FX in my opinion.  Timothy Olyphant is great in this.  I was a huge fan of Deadwood and thought he was great in that.  Justified has a lot of action in it and I think the reason is his Deadwood character seems an awful lot like Raylan Givens.  I also like the character Boyd Crowder played by Walter Goggins of The Shield, another FX show that was very good.  I highly recommend you give this show a try.",Positive
All of the Shaun the Sheep stories are great. The episodes are for everyone who enjoys a good laugh. The farmer and his girlfriend are so spot on - You just know something is going to go wrong!,Positive
"Well I'm almost embarrassed to say how much I've enjoyed Dance Moms. Some think it's like approving of child abuse, but my take is each of these kids have at least one loving parent (no matter how misguided), they seem to love Abby (maybe a little less asthe show goes on) and want to be there. Meanwhile, for some reason I love all the emotional back and forth. I love the Moms (not equally - Christi and Holly are my favorites). I'll have to contemplate why I enjoy it so much.Also, in the first season Abby wore almost no make-up. By Season 4 she's looking kinda like a drag queen (not that that's a bad thing).",Positive
"After the first couple of episodes I was not sure I'd watch the whole season.  There was a lot of set up that was needed.  After you get through the setup, the whole season takes off.  It offers action just like the movies but also the humor and human interest that you would expect.  If you like the movies - keep watching and you will like the show as well.",Positive
Do not believe all the rave reviews.  They're  all from family members and die hard fans who don't want to see these bird killers go.  It's time to close the curtains on this lame show already.,Negative
"Focusing on the lives of physicists, and geeky ones at that, does make for an atypical television series, but a great cast, original characters, and high quality writing, combine to produce a modern comedic gem.  Created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, it understandably took a little while for the creative team to develop the personalities of the characters.  But once the basic parameters were set, The Big Bang Theory began to boldly go where no comedy has gone before.With characters that always seem to be evolving, the series explores some unusual topics, and frequently heads into uncharted territory, usually making it impossible to predict what may happen.  This is one of the main reasons why this unique, goofy, show is so hilarious and captivating.  The creative team taps into facets of pop culture that may be associated with geeks and nerds (and teenage boys in general), and find ways to weave them into their stories, often in an exaggerated way.  Science fiction, comic books, superheroes, video games, television, action figures, paint ball fights, Star Wars, and the Star Trek universe, are just a few of the subjects that are featured.The cast is marvelous, with Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hofstadter, the shy guy enchanted by his new neighbor.  Jim Parsons is Sheldon Cooper.  If you look up the word neurotic, Sheldon's photo just might be there.  Simon Helberg is Howard Wolowitz, the delusional sleaze, who does still have his good points.  Kunal Nayyar is Rajesh Koothrappali, who can't speak to a beautiful woman unless he is under the influence of alcohol.  Kaley Cuoco is Penny, the girl from Omaha who moved next door, works at the Cheesecake Factory . . . . and changed their universe.Since Sheldon is off the scale when it comes to weirdness (what Penny would later come to describe as `whackadoodle'), and Wolowitz and Raj are arguably more `abnormal', Leonard seems the most sensible of the bunch.  Sheldon is totally unique, so bizarre in his beliefs, behavior and speech, that he seems at times to be from another planet.  Jim Parsons is a amazing comic talent, with a bright, bright future.Penny has a multi-faceted role.  One is as the primary female character, another is that she usually represents as close to a 'normal' persons' point of view as we will get.  As a link to reality, she is often the reference that shows just how wacked out the guys really are.  The times when she joins them in their world (such as when she fragged Sheldon on Halo night), are often some of the program's funniest moments.  By the end of the season, everything about the show is clearly peaking.  In `The Pancake Batter Anomaly', Sheldon gets sick, and Penny gets stuck taking care of him, rubbing Vaporub on his chest, and singing `Soft Kitty'.  In `The Bat Jar Conjecture', it's Sheldon's team versus the rest of the gang and Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), in the Physics Bowl.  Sheldon's knockout of a twin sister arrives and makes waves, in `The Pork Chop Indeterminacy'.  Sheldon gets a look in the mirror, in `The Jerusalem Duality' when a young genius arrives on campus.  In `The Nerduana Annihilation', when Leonard buys the time machine used in the classic 60's film `The Time Machine' on eBay, Penny's  astute description is that `It looks like something that Elton John would drive through the Everglades'.  In the season finale, there's a glimmer of hope for romance for Leonard, in `The Tangerine Factor' when Penny agrees to go out with him.The Big Bang Theory is simply one of the most engaging comedies to come along in years.  Each episode seems to fly by, and leave you wanting more.  Some commentary tracks would have been cool, but the only bonus is the `Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory' a look at the creators, cast, and genesis of the show.  There are only seventeen episodes in the First Season due to the writers' strike.Things only get better in the second season, as the show's creative team continue to develop the characters, and introduce new elements to the mix, keeping things fresh and extremely funny.  As Sheldon Cooper might say, it is a foregone conclusion that the third season will be characterized by the same outstanding writing, and brilliantly quirky humor found in the first two seasons, continuing to keep The Big Bang Theory, at the cutting edge of contemporary comedy.",Positive
i really enjoyed this series. i hope it continues. the actors are very entertaining. one used to be on prison break.,Positive
"I had no idea what I was getting into with this show, and it continues to grab me and yet shock me every episode.  If you had always agreed with the expression &#34;kill all the lawyers&#34; , this show will give you reasons.  It is filled with outstanding acting...Glen Close is breathtaking in her evil.  One thing about it....trust no one.  It is not an easy show to watch but you can't help coming back for more.",Positive
"Well, after watching over 50 episodes, this series has some great moments and finally achieved the elusive 5 star rating with me.  Still no sign of the lost member of the team Leah, who disappeared without explanation.  I guess it just adds to the intrigue.  Highly recommended though.",Positive
Another example of Michaels brain over brawnEven as individuals unravel they stay true to their charactersThe series isn't as believable in this season but it doesn't have to be as the emotional attachment to the characters has already been formedThey keep the series exciting with more implied violence than actual blood and gore which I think is more intelligent,Positive
"CEREMONY is one of the brighter starts to rise out of Hollywood this year. Though it was made in 2010 and released on Demand TV  before its ultimate release on theaters, it is hopefully going to gather the audience it so richly deserves.  It is a young work: the writer/director is Max Winkler, son of Henry Winkler, a bright young talent who essentially makes his debut with little sparkler. Not only has he come up with a fresh idea for a story but he has also matched that story with a script that is at all times warmly entertaining and at many points a sensitive, philosophical examination of relationships today. And he has cast the film with some of the finest young actors on screen at present.Sam Davis (Michael Angarano, a brilliant young actor in his early 20s, so memorable in the deeply touching 'One Last Thing') writes children's books and lives in the child like fantasies of kids.  He has a friend Marshall Schmidt (Reece Thompson, another early 20s bright young talent) who happens to show up as the only member of an audience to hear Sam read his latest new children's book.  The two boys rekindle their friendship, stagnant for the past year while Marshall recovered from an altercation and hid in his parents home while Sam had a momentary encounter with a beautiful 30s something woman Zoe (Uma Thurman).  The two lads decide to take a little trip to ostensibly to get Marshall out of his parent's home to see the world, but in actuality Sam has heard that Zoe is marrying some wealthy guy, Whit Coutell (Lee Pace, another brilliant actor remembered for his shattering performance in 'Soldier's Girl'), at Whit's lavish seaside home.Sam and Marshall mend long absent feelings of closeness and taking some daring steps they drive to the seaside estate, obtain an invitation to Zoe's party (her wedding to Whit Actually) from Zoe's drunken brother Teddy (Jake  M. Johnson).  Sam confronts Zoe, stating his love and his desire to marry her, but Zoe needs more than a young kid to satisfy her and sees the opportunities of marrying the moneyed Whit.  In a series of incidents both hilarious at times and deeply tender at others all characters discover new concepts of relationships.  How the film ends is left for the viewer to discover.Michael Angarano is pitch perfect as Sam, a young man whose ideals are tested and who must learn the adult role.  His skills are so polished at this young stage in his career that he is bound to become a major star.  Reece Thompson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman gives one of her most well rounded performances.  Lee Pace makes the most of his role, sparkling as the reigning optimist of the story.  But in the end most of the credit for the success of this little gem is due to the talent of Max Winkler who writes as well as he directs: he is a formidable force.  Highly Recommended.

"Always excellent story and intrigue of english detective drama. Not the usual jumping from 20 story buildings, 90 pound ladies beating up a 250 pound man, seen in so many &#34;detective movies&#34; of the mainstream today. Real nice change. All of the actors are superb, especially Helen Mirren.",Positive

"I had to wait about nine months for this, but it was well worth it. Season Two is every bit as suspenseful as season one. I recommend it.",Positive
"Good title, great cast with a sick story to tell.

"For the second season of this wonderful mystery/comedy show, the producers wisely left things pretty much alone.  Shawn Spenser (James Roday) comes from a long line of cops.  But he rebelled against his father's (Corbin Bernsen) wishes and didn't become a cop.  Instead, he pretends to be a psychic, using his finely honed observation skills to get the information for his ""visions.""  He's even opened Psych, a psychic detective agency with best friend Burton ""Gus"" Guster (Dule Hill).  And he has an impressive track record, much to the dismay of Detective Lassiter (Timothy Omundsun).  Rounding out the cast are Santa Barbara Detective Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Interim Chief of Police Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson).And what a collection of cases they have this year, too.  Shawn and Gus join the TV sensation American Duos to find out who is trying to kill the head judge (played by Tim Curry).  They become models to find out who killed both partners of a fashion house.  Shawn must clear Gus' parents of murdering the neighborhood crank.  When Gus' uncle (guest star John Amos) comes for a visit, Shawn and Gus have to switch places, without the police figuring out that both of them are faking it.  Equally complicated is a case where a real psychic is brought in and Shawn must keep his secret from her.  Shawn puts his credibility on the line by claiming one victim was killed by a dinosaur.  And in the season finale, Shawn pins the crime on a mummy.This show has real come together and is firing on all pistons now.  The mysteries are tight and confusing.  I might piece things together a little before Shawn, but not by much.  And it doesn't matter because the entire fun is getting to the end.  The over the top physical humor has been toned down this year (and that's a good thing), but there is still plenty of laughs.  You've got cultural references spewed in mile a minute dialogue by Shawn and Gus, comedy from the character's relationships, comedy from the situations, and some physical humor.  I can't stop myself from laughing out loud while I watch this show.  And the cast does a great job holding it all together.  They bring high energy to each episode, but they keep it real.If you have missed this show, you have definitely missed out.  Don't let another day go by without becoming a fan.",Positive
"Clara is a stabilizing ifluence on the Doctor, even if it seems the other way around. This series of episodes was fun to watch.",Positive
"Season 2 of Grimm was very interesting, to say the least!!! You have the Grimm, Nick, growing in his role as the Grimm.  He is showing his human side and his Grimm side and sometimes those two sides clash!  It is fun to watch and see all the different people involved in his life finding out how much they need him and, how much they can trust him!!  It is a great show to watch and enjoy!!",Positive
I couldn't get into this and I love Judi Dench. I'll give it another try and rating. When I started watching it I may have wanted something that grabbed me from the start and it fell short.,Negative
"Did not like this movie, there was too much running and did not enjoy the acting as much as the other version.",Negative
"One of those &#34;guilty pleasure&#34; things.  Watching those upper-crust moms fighting about perceived slights to their poor little girls gives us a cheap way to feel morally superior.  We do feel genuinely sorry for the little girls who are being shown very poor examples of how to act.  To their credit, they are very supportive of each other, even as their mothers snipe back and forth.",Negative
"This show is a little unusual as he is a psychotic person that has invisible friends.  However, once you get past that every thing is cool.  We really enjoy this show.  The show is probably best for some one over the age of 16.",Positive

"Being a Sci-Fi fan, I was looking forward to seeing this new (to the U.S.) series. Great plot lines, good acting, nice sets. I screwed up not recording the first 2 episodes. Paid 3 bucks to see them. Worth every penny. Can hardly wait for the next episode.",Positive
"Top Shot is one of my favorite programs on television to date. That being said I watch it to see professionals use their tools at the top if the game. I do not enjoy the ridiculous melodrama the shows producers seem to think we need to make the characters ""interesting"".  Tell me more about their history and background, show me what they shoot at home, or where maybe, thst would interest me. I couldn't care less if one player likes another player. The show is about the weaponry and its implementation by expert hands. That is really all I wish to see. If it weren't for the attempt to show the most base of our behaviors by exploiting every minor drama I would have given the show five stars without hesitation.",Positive
"I thought I might like this show since it included many of the actresses that I really like, but I guess the writing is really bad because the show was boring. I may give it another chance.",Negative
"I should just keep my mouth shut.  But could not tolerate this show at all.  Lame.  They just recycled the Stargate saga, but out came trash.  I love the Stargate stuff, but this was just lame lame lame.",Negative
"I really enjoyed the Onion News Network and was disappointed when IFC cancelled it.  Was hoping for something like that here as a second chance.  Or even Sports Dome.  Wasn't expecting it to be a serial comedy instead of a parody.  Maybe the creators wanted to go a different direction because they were tired of being cancelled.I won't knock it for that.  But it was too frenetic and disjointed for my taste.It came off more as MAD magazine than anything else.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I was just hoping for more satire and less wackiness.A lot of great talent well played.  A lot of funny lines.  But I was gritting my teeth more than laughing.If this were up against fewer shows that were better, I'd like this to have a shot.  But I would rather other shows like Alpha House, Betas, or Those Who Can't get the shot over this one if it comes to that.",Negative

"I went into this expecting a supernatural horror because of the description and marketing; I originally thought this movie was a haunted apartment, Silent Hill 4: The Room style film. Occupant is a psychological thriller about a young man, Danny, that has to stay in his dead grandmother's apartment for 12 days in order to keep it at a low monthly price. If he leaves, he risks the possibility of the landlord kicking him out. Consequently, Danny begins to suffer from paranoia leading to delusions and hallucinations. The story was great until the end that tries to explain everything. I personally thought it was weak since it still left many unanswered questions. The day by day transitions were overdone and some of the editing was bad. It's creepy but not scary. The acting was fine.There is some blood, and a brief sex scene (nothing is shown). I recommend going into this film as a psychological thriller, not a ghost-horror movie. It'll be much better that way. It's available on Netflix Streaming as of 6/23/12, if you're slightly interested.",Positive
"""The company sent me to look for towns or cities that might benefit from our services. Durham was on my list."" The town of Durham, like most cities has been hit hard by the bad economy. People are moving out and the unemployment rate is high. Gus Leroy (Firth) comes into town with a track record of helping towns recover and end unemployment. The town is unsure of his method, storing hazardous waste until it can be transported. This is another movie that proves that just because a movie has no CGI or explosions every five minutes it receives no marketing and the release it needs. This is a movie that is full of great actors and great performances. The plot is not that exciting, but the acting makes up for it. Colin Firth does a fantastic job in this movie of playing a guy who you aren't sure of. The entire movie he keeps you on edge wondering if he is really as good as he seems. Much like ""Company Men"" this is a movie that is a serious subject that sounds boring when you read it, but the acting makes it great. A must watch. Overall, a great movie filled with great acting that deserves a bigger audience then it will get. I give it an A.Would I watch again? - Yes I would.*Also try - Company Men",Positive
"The show has some funny gags. But focusing on one party, really a bad idea. If they had two houses with a set of democratic and a set of republicans, or mixed them in a house it would have been better. I am all for political satire, but even the Colbert report, and The Daily Show go after both parties. Honestly I am not sure what it was, but I felt venom in the jokes, not satire. I sort of felt like I was watching a 1938 comedy out of Germany depicting jews, or a cold war era comedy stereotyping Warsaw pact nations peoples, or a black face play in the 1920's, or a 1950's kids cartoon stereotyping indians, or asians. You get the idea.If they went after all sides, like all successful political satires do I would approve. But in it's current form, it is really not something I want to see more of. They should have taken more inspiration from the late George Carlin.",Negative

"This is where it all began...I'm not the one who loves this show. My child does.I imagine it is a modern version of Sesame Street,focusing on music, art, and social skills.Young children understand that it's silly and funny.So, it's now a part of our pop culture.",Positive

"In Short: Based on the unsolved disappearance of Kathleen Durst, this movie gives viewers one theory of what happened. The names were changed for the film. Kathleen is a lively young girl from a middle income family who meets Robert Durst (changed to Marks) , the son of a millionaire property investor. The couple were drifting apart when Kathleen came up missing.The plot was pretty suspenseful. I knew nothing of the &#34;true story&#34; behind it until after I watched, but it did start taking a dark turn pretty quickly and the gore level was minimal. I don't remember seeing anything that made me even remotely squeamish. A great deal of it is done by implying.Before watching &#34;All Good Things&#34; I would have seriously doubted Ryan Gosling's ability to play anything sinister. He just has one of those wholesome faces. Well he did a great job. Kirstin Dunst was great. Her transition from care-free to jaded was well done.",Positive
"Well-executed excursion into an earlier era in a still-young Las Vegas. Fascinating contrasts between the original ranching culture and the urban gambling industry newcomers.  Would have gotten six stars, except that the season's ending seemed forced, as if the ongoing story lines had to be wrapped up prematurely.",Positive

"Hell On Wheels - The Complete First Season (2011)I stumbled upon this show by complete accident not being a regular TV viewer. I saw the title featured on Amazon and recalled seeing that term used in the book ""Nothing Like It in the World"", Stephen Ambrose's history of the trans-continental railroad. The term described the nomadic towns that sprang up and accompanied the construction of the nations railroads. I impulsively purchased the First Season and submit the following observations.I was very impressed with the sets, location and, of course, the rolling stock - trains. Having resided in the mid-west for several years - Minnesota - the Canadian prairies looked very authentic to me.From my reading the rail towns were, in fact, lawless and vice was rampant. The survivors of the Civil War, both Union and Confederates were attracted to the wide-open lifestyle. Outward expressions of racial and ethnic enmity was part of the then American culture. Of course dramatic liberties were taken but the basic social interactions portrayed reflect, I believe, the situations, as they actually existed.The actors were unknown to this viewer but were memorable for their roles particularly ""The Swede"" and Joseph Black Moon.One real attractive aspect of the box set are the behind the scenes documentaries that are included. One fact that impressed me no end was that the locomotive used in Season One was made out of wood!I just purchased Season 2 so you know I'll give this series a good rating!",Positive
I am very happy that we have a season 4 with Lost Girl. The show is exciting and interesting.The episodes are well written and the actors are perfect for the parts they play. Especially Anna Silk and Zoie Palmer. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who is interested in seeing plots and acting that are more exciting and interesting then most of the shows on television. Watch it and you will see what I mean.,Positive
"I liked the cast, for sure, and the premise (private lives of some oddball senators) is definitely funny. I laughed a few times at the pilot, but it was more amusing and interesting than it was laugh-out-loud funny. Overall, though, I liked it and would watch more if it existed.",Positive
loved this episode! Are they all getting more good looking as the show progresses? Woderfull! It felt very action movie-ish. Christian Kane was smoldering!,Positive
"I think I like this more than the children but it's a very cute show. I like that they are dealing with big concepts from a small, simple point of view and it has a quirky humor",Positive
"Very explicit and disturbing to watch.the acting was good ,but I would not watch the rest of the series. Topic is child killing and a suspect very disturbed.",Negative
"I thought HERE COMES THE DEVIL was a sweet movie. I loved the way it was shock. Loved the disturbing scenes. The cast was solid. Story was cool and believable. If you're into horror/B-horror movies - this one's worth checking out. - Mike, iWatchMike.com",Positive
Got to hand it to this film for knowing what it is and letting its freak flag fly. Way over the top grindhouse blood bath. I hate to admit it but I was entertained.,Negative
"I am a sucker for movies that are based on true stories since I enjoy reading up the actual true stories and try to see how much of the movie got wrong or left out, etc. Anyways, this film &#34;Perfect Sisters&#34; is just another typical good true story movie but what's interesting about this case is that these two girls almost got away with the perfect crime. Even more interesting is that the two girls, who's name have been changed due to being underage when the crime occurred, they are both walking free today and living among us. Did you enjoy &#34;Alpha dog&#34; or &#34;Bernie&#34; or &#34;Pain and Gain&#34; or even &#34;Boy's don't cry?&#34; Then check out perfect sisters, it's actually quite a good film and I was surprised with the two actresses that played the two girls pulled off the roles very well. Glad to have rent this and watched this, check it out!",Positive

"From a review I wrote for Bleeding Cool:One of my favourite Science Fiction movies of the year, the adaptation of Philip K. Dick&#8217;s Radio Free Albemuth opens theatrically in ten US cities this week after a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for distribution. Everyone should see it.Shot on an indie budget, the story takes place in an alternate 1984 where a Nixon-esque right-wing president has imposed martial law in America and a music executive finds himself receiving mystical transmissions from an alien intelligence that changes his life and encourages him to seek out the Resistance and help them overthrow the government.The original novel was published in 1985, three years after Dick&#8217;s death. It was one of his most personal books because he was fictionalising the mystical experiences in real life that his hero had, and wrote himself as a character in the book as the hero&#8217;s best friend to question what had happened to him. It started him on the path of exploring his Gnosticism and mystical enquiries that fuelled his writing for the rest of his life. He had originally written the novel in 1976 under the title &#8220;Valis-system A&#8221; and submitted it for publication but his editors at the time asked for too many changes than he was willing to make.  He went on to write Valis, The Divine Invasion and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, which weren&#8217;t really Science Fiction novels. Radio Free Albemuth was, in effect, the last Science Fiction novel Dick wrote, and if Tim Powers hadn&#8217;t held onto the manuscript and brought to publishers&#8217; attention after Dick&#8217;s death, we might never have known about it.John Alan Simon&#8217;s movie adaptation is a true labour of love, a small movie with big ideas that faithfully fallows the novel and its preoccupations with mysticism and fighting totalitarianism. Alongside Richard Linklater&#8217;s A Scanner Darkly, it&#8217;s the only movie that faithful adapts a Philip K. Dick novel. It also feel like the novel in its evocation of 1985 and its dystopian atmosphere. It does have minor alterations: the main characters in the movie are still in their vibrant 30s instead the most tired middle-age of the novel, and Simon relocates the story from Orange County to Los Angeles because that&#8217;s where the music industry is based, and it makes more sense to have the main character move there when he starts working as a music executive.There&#8217;s an elegiac feel to the movie, not only because it&#8217;s a story about the friendship between a man changed by a mystical, extraterrestrial experience and his sceptical best friend, but also that it&#8217;s the kind of independent film that&#8217;s in danger of dying out in light of studios only producing blockbusters and the internet chipping away at traditional ways of watching movies. It&#8217;s also more overtly political in its commentary on surveillance, the loss of civil rights and the need to resist. When I first saw the movie at a special screening last year, Edward Snowden hadn&#8217;t happened yet, and what a difference a year makes in the way that places this movie square in the center of the zeitgeist, becoming even more timely now than when I first saw it. It&#8217;s also a movie that evokes Los Angeles as a state of mind, one of my continuing obsessions.This is Science Fiction without the need for hundred-million-dollar budgets, explosions, shootouts or major special effects. It&#8217;s all about ideas and how they can create a whole different world and state of mind just by context. It&#8217;s one of the essential movies of the year, and to see it in a theatre if you can is a show of support for not only this type of independent movie, but for the theatrical experience. Simon has accomplished the challenging task of bringing Philip K. Dick&#8217;s provocative and chilling vision and sensibility to the screen with terrific performances, especially Shea Whigham from Boardwalk Empire as Philip K. Dick and Alanis Morissette as a kind of slacker Joan of Arc co-conspirator.  If it&#8217;s not at a cinema in your town, you can catch it On Demand. You need to see this movie.",Positive
My wife is a big fan of Agatha Christie and particularly Poirot.  The 51 minute length fits nicely between regular TV shows.  The quality is fine.,Positive
it reminds me of a friend's house whereeveryone came to party and over the years the drama stirred itself up and everyone seemed 2 faced.  People either grow together or apart.  It's a great watch...but it also makes me sad.,Positive
This is a great show!  A must watch for everyone.  Always keeps you on the edge for the next twist!,Positive
either this or the rebels is going to get made it is a good cop drama  however it ends on a cliffhanger so if it isn't made you will need to read the book to find out what happens,Positive
I would have to say this is my new fav show. I was never a fan of the old one but this one is awesome.,Positive
Grimm is pretty entertaining.  It can be predictable but it is pretty good. The violence is too scary for pre-teen children.,Negative
"I like the show and I will be back to watch it again and again, thanks Amazon.  The show, shows how much a husband will do to keep his not so brite wife happy.  But trying to keep up with the Rockfellers, is not what I would want to do. I want to live my life the way God wants me to do.  This wife is everything I as a wife do not want to do with my husband.  But watching her she makes you laugh and say at the same time,  &#34;oh no she didn't. Thank you Amazon. God Bless You.  Sincerely yours; Georgia",Positive
"It was a good spooky movie.  I saw that some of the reviews weren't very good, but I thought the movie was great.  Lots of atmosphere, and I even shut my eyes a few times.  It is not a slash and gash and is nothing like Blair Witch which I unfortunately paid money to see.  If your expecting a bloody horror kill fest this movie is not for you.  If you want to feel scared of things that go bump in the night, this is the movie for that!  I guess the word for this movie is unnerving...",Positive
"This series may be the best series produced on television in years. I love it, and it is well done in every detail. A TV series viewed by streaming beats straight up Hollywood movies every time. I think that they as a genre have the better screen-play writers and they are more tightly constructed. I for one am forever binge watching something made devoid of commercials. My favorites are Revenge, The Lying Game, which was truncated in the broadcaster's blunder, and Ringer. I confess I am also enjoying Switched at Birth. As an only child (now 78 and reliving my childhood in my day dreams), I enjoy stories involving screwed up and reconstructed sibling relationship. Wish I had a sibling. Put your shrinks to work on this and it may help you get at the core of why some people of my age like things. Market research, but you can't simply ask. You have to figure it out. Oh, for best actress in these I have to go with Ally Chando and maybe Vanessa Marano. Emily Van Camp is very good too.",Positive
"Take notice...Hollywood:  family values, ethics, religious faith draw viewers.I thoroughly enjoy the excellent writing, storylines, cast of characters, acting; all superb.",Positive

"I rated this 6 stars because I thought it was very well made.  It gave a very good and detailed account of what it is like to livein the mountains.  All the struggles, challenges and highlights of a life that most of us could never imagine.  Following themen and their families was very interesting and I am looking forward to seeing Season 2!  I would highly recommend this!Lots of information and well done.",Positive
Great show for a detective drama based tv series. Good humor and good story lines. I will be watching all the prime tv episodes that are available.,Positive
"Clean and heartwarming, Cedar Cove is based off the book series by the same name. I like the book version better but that is no surprise. I tend to prefer the book versions and my imagination, over tv/movie versions. Cedar Cove is well done though for the most part. There were some story lines I felt could have been made a bit stronger. Overall it is uplifting fantasy that will give you a needed break from the harsh reality of the day and the sex/violence of most tv shows. The town is gorgeous and interesting. Always something fun and a bit quirky going on. Worth the watch.",Positive
"Very entertaining, and enlightenment of what articles are really worth. I'd recommend this program to anyone who has old memorabilia lying around to watch this program.",Positive
"The first season of this series is very pleasant has all the ingredients of the best British period dramas.  There is a liberal helping of humor, a wide selection of local characters portrayed by a strong cast and enough history to make it interesting.  Julia Sawalha, who played the feckless Lydia in the classic 1996 Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, is the lead actress in a very different role.  She is the independent and strong-minded postmistress to the small town of Candleford.  Life and death, family secrets and the friction between town and the less prosperous country village of Lark Rise combine to make a satisfying contrast.",Positive
"The Americans is the story of a married couple of KGB spies planted in Washington DC during the Reagan era. The 1980s timeshift alone is enough to intrigue, given the heightening tensions with the USSR, and the surveillance and counter intelligence operations in a world without cell phones and laptops. But the show is carried expertly by the two principal actors who balance the demands of a family life with the complex and dangerous missions supplied by their agency, and it's really the plot of their personal lives that keeps the audience coming back for more.The show is very carefully plotted to ensure that amid growing suspense, it doesn't start to become ludicrous. As much as I loved the first season of Homeland, this is one of the flaws in its execution - by the time the screenwriters had Brody murdering the Vice President, it started to strain under its own ridiculousness. The Americans pushes the envelope with each episode but never so far to break the consistency of the characters.Although it features strong action sequences, these play second fiddle to the paranoia of managing a double life - one that involves raising children in a foreign country under a false identity, and another about infiltrating that country under the allegiance of another. This presents a dilemma for the audience too since our heroes are villains and we can't help but feel a twang of betrayal as we hope they succeed in their missions.Overall, I can't recommend The Americans enough especially if you have enjoyed Homeland or House of Cards. It's yet again another reminder that the best drama is happening on TV rather than in the movies right now.",Positive
"When the Lifetime network announced that it was producing a movie called ""House of Versace"" with Gina Gershon playing Donatella, I had to wonder whether they would play it as camp or go for a more serious approach. No offense to the actual Donatella Versace, but she is a bigger-than-life personality that is ripe for comedic interpretation. Maya Rudolph absolutely nailed the fashion icon is a series of skits for SNL, but I had faith that Gershon could also bring the goods. And in truth, it is for Gershon primarily that the ""House of Versace"" is worth a look. If you think that ninety minutes of Lifetime fare will do justice to the Versace legend, your expectations probably won't be met. But if you just want a casual glimpse into that world and a bare bones biography, this passes the time easily enough. I anticipated a little more insight into some aspect of the Versace legacy, whether it be the business, the fashion, or the family. But the movie's screenplay really skimps on all three. The first part of the movie plays more toward a campy excess while the second half attempts something more serious. Both parts, however, lack much depth of character or history.As the movie opens, Gianni Versace (Enrico Colantoni) has already achieved enormous success with Donatella as the public face of the company and their under-appreciated brother Santo (Colm Feore) playing a role behind-the-scenes in a business capacity. The plot focuses on the sibling dynamic and the movie's best (and oftentimes most amusing) moments come from the interactions between Colantoni and Gershon. Many of these sequences play out in the fashion workroom, but not much is detailed when it comes to the clothes. When tragedy strikes, the family and the public look to Donatella to take the reins of the company. The film, once again, doesn't spend much time on the events leading up to development. This is not a crime drama, so that doesn't become a focus. Instead, in true Lifetime fashion, the rest of the movie deals with a downward spiraling Donatella. Fueled by drink, drugs, and the scrutiny and skepticism of the world at large, she is determined to take over as lead designer even as she alienates those closest to her. While this is a perfectly reasonable story thread, years go by at the drop of a hat. No time is spent on the disintegrating company, only on Donatella as an addict. Will she get it together? Do I even have to answer that? I bet you can guess, and just in time for the credits to roll on her triumph.My main issues with ""House of Versace"" all come from a rather uninspired screenplay. With the wealth of juicy material and the sheer originality of the Versace clan, I was sad to see this develop into just another ""woman in trouble"" picture for Lifetime. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy much of it. I love a boozy Gina Gershon as much as the next person and her performance had me enthralled. I also enjoyed Colantoni, and even Raquel Welch (I haven't seen her in a while, she looks great) does a credible job as the matriarch. But the movie lacks an insider's perspective or insight that would have made it truly memorable. Quite literally, I know NOTHING more about the Versace family after watching this movie than I did before. And I am no expert on Vercace! Still, I've certainly seen worse from Lifetime. This just had so much potential. Again, see it for Gershon. Her Donatella is strangely captivating, I just wished that the screenplay supported her better. KGHarris, 10/13.",Negative

"This pilot is a great set up for a long term TV series, and it is a perfect vehicle for John Goodman.  Okay yes it comes from Gary Trudeau so you know this show will lean heavily left and ridicule these GOP senators, but if there is a message for the GOP, it is they need to get with the times or get torn apart, and putting four GOP senators, including a young gun, in the same house could show that while setting up some great, challenging entertainment. Goodman's assistant is also a great character. Give Alpha House the green light.",Positive
"WD kills it again.  This season added a completely new element by the addition of &#34;the governor&#34;.  In fact he became the character you love to hate.  I didn't know who I hated more: the governor or Joffrey from Game of Thrones.  In any case, there is some real drama in this season and even tenser moments than seasons past.

"I've seen only a handful of movies over the years that have blown me away.  Most of those are now labeled as `classics' in the world of film, and rightfully so; the films in that category are just as visually brilliant as they are in dramatic appeal.  I'm proud to announce EUROPA REPORT should be added to that canon of titles.  This is an amazing film and is a Must See of 2013!One of the aspects that impresses me the most about this film is the attention to actual scientific detail.  The premise of an ocean existing under the ice layer is one that NASA has recently speculated upon and, like one of the scientists in the film states, we (as a species) have always found life where we have found water.  This makes for interesting speculative science and excellent science-fiction.EUROPA REPORT is shot very well and looks visually stunning onscreen.  The CG is integrated flawlessly into the film, giving it a huge boost of credibility and allowing the audience full immersion into the tension.  With broad, vivid depictions of the ship and the planets themselves, the imagery of the film is half the reason to watch it.The taut premise is the other half.  There's plenty of drama to go around in the film, and it starts pretty much from the opening scenes.  Director Sebastian Cordero does a masterful job of blending current story with backstory, and the result is a well thought-out and tightly knit plot.  It never once lags nor strays from where it should go.I LOVED the ending of EUROPA REPORT, and I think it fits perfectly into the film.  I've read other reviews from folks that said they didn't like it, but maybe they didn't understand it.  For me, it sealed the deal on this epic picture.EUROPA REPORT is an amazing spectacle, and I highly recommend it.  Be sure and check it out on Blu-ray to take advantage of the beautiful planetscapes and in-depth details.  There are also a couple of nice Special Features to go along with it, including a behind-the-scenes look at the visual effects.",Positive

"Great show, loved the stories when I was young, Good actors really enjoy it. Find myself wanting to keep watching.",Positive
"Josh Selig may have just created the next Amazon original for kids, because The Jo B. & G. Raff Show was outstanding in my opinion. I loved how the main characters COMPROMISED on how they were going to do their show. Plus, they love to dance and sing. When toddlers watched the Wonder Pets, they found that show amazing. This will entertain just like the Wonder Pets. I say this needs to be seen on Amazon.",Positive
This I think was a good enough show just the fact that it was canceled after about 2 seasons sucks,Positive
"I'm not really into ""cop"" shows or ""detective"" shows that dominate network t.v. because they are usually dull, predictable, depressing, and totally lacking any humor.  ""In Plain Sight""  doesn't suffer from these problems.Luckily, I stumbled across this series last summer.  The main character is a Federal Marshall who is involved in the Witness Protection program.  She has to keep her clients safe and solve murders based upon her client's testimony.  She and her partner Marshall have great chemistry together on-screen.If you're a fan of ""Burn Notice"" you will enjoy this series as well; although they are different shows, what they share in common is humor, action, and great characters which are well written.  The writers also explore the personal dramas of the main characters which makes for an interesting back-story.Season 2 premieres April 2009 on USA network for existing fans of the show- for those that are curious and have never watched the show, rent/buy season 1 on dvd and you'll be up to speed when season 2 starts.** highly recommended **",Positive
I have always lived the little bear books so I love this show.  It is very uplifting and I prefer it over some of theory trendy kids shows.  It is timeless.,Positive
great to have this fill in the shows I missed,Positive
"never knew a fire fighter so didn't know what their work life was like. this is an informative documentary featuring fire fighters in Detroit, which is unfortunately experiencing urban blight along with extreme budget shortfalls. believably presented; I liked it. 3 and 1/2 stars.",Negative
"I screened this film the other day and was totally surprised.  Pleasantly surprised.This movie is very funny and quirky, especially at the beginning.  As the film progresses it becomes more terrifying, but the director did a very good job of taking his time and building the suspense.  While watching, I actually started thinking about the whole ""found footage"" (FF) genre, if that is a genre.  Now, this is surely not of that genre, thank god.  I have to admit, if I see another FF movie I am going to, well, scream.  Not scream from fear but scream from boredom and pain.Probably the reason I thought of the whole FF genre:  the two main characters here - a guy and a gal who have temporarily taken over running a hotel just before it closes - have their own video cameras and equipment, and are trying to record evidence of a ghost in the hotel.  Now, Sara Paxton is very good here and very funny; and Pat Healy is excellent as well.  Even Kelly McGillis gives a nice performance as a, well, psychic, I guess.I guess the critics really liked this film but the average viewer did not.  I think that I know why.  This film plays it straight; it doesn't rely on some lame twisteroo at the end.  I liked that alot.  If you are a twisteroo fan - there are many of those out there and twist away - you probably won't like this film.  But for me, this was a very refreshing idea:  no twisteroos!  Whoda thunk it?A surprisingly big recommendation here.",Positive
show was short lived so no answers were really given as to the disappearance and reappearance of the inmates and others there.,Positive
"I'm Catholic and I don't like when Hollywood makes fun of my religion.  That said, I was worried that I'd be turned off American Horror Story in its second season because Jessica Lange portrays a nun and the season is set in a Catholic asylum for the insane.  I was concerned that Ryan Murphy would just make this a 13-episode attack on the Catholic Church.I love being wrong in a situation like this...and being surprised by a series.  I am a big horror fan but feel that the best and most scary movies in the genre were made in the 70s and 80s...and that ever since the advent of CGI horror stories have been mostly ridiculous...or they'd go the Scream route and be sarcastic and self-referential.I love what Ryan Murphy is doing with AHS and I'm someone who does not enjoy Glee or New Normal (Murphy's other two shows).While I think he does try to make political points, he's a great craftsman of horror.  The season one ""Murder House"" story was inventive and original...and has become one of my favorite haunted house stories of all time.  Season two's ""Asylum"" storyline (set in the early 1960s) is scary the way the Exorcist or The Omen were scary.  And the cast of actors assembled for this show is incredible.  I just love that many of them return from season to season, playing different parts.  I hope this continues for many years to come.I keep coming back to the word imaginative with this show because I honestly never know what's going to come at us on the screen next.  This Asylum season has a serial killer, aliens, demonic possession, Nazis, torture porn, and about a half dozen other things.  There's also a mystery set in the present as we find out what happened to the asylum to render it into ruins in our time.  I find myself sitting back and wondering what's going to happen next week once an episode ends.  And throughout the week, while waiting for the next installment, I think about what's going to come next too.I can't think of another show where I do this.A few years back, there was an anthology show called ""Masters of Horror"" on cable that I hoped would be a weekly, scary horror story...but it ended up being very hit or miss.  For me, American Horror Story delivers that sort of weekly, imaginative scare that I thought ""Masters of Horror"" would bring.  Each episode has some new twist in it...while continuing a cohesive story each season.  And then next season we get a new story.I really love this format and concept.  The show is very much worth your time...but it is not too gory and it is definitely not trying to force too much of Ryan Murphy's personal politics on you as I at first feared.  It's just a really great show that's way better than any horror movie I can think of made after the mid-1980s.",Positive
"I actually am giving this 4.5 stars, and I believe I have good reason. The first reason is that this is a computer generated video that uses computer graphics to represent &#34;outer space&#34;. There are no actual images from &#34;outer space&#34;. That causes the production to lose half a star. The main reason I rated it so highly is because this video is technically an ambient &#34;white noise&#34; generator. This would be very well used as a tool for relaxation, and quite possibly meditation, if the volume is not loud. A bonus would be a big screen to watch it on, or have it projected. The graphics are not exactly the same, although the 'style' of graphics are the same. Star-field simulators, space tunnels, psuedo-nebulae, even some galactic jellyfish! They are indeed set up like a computer screensaver, and sometimes are in different combinations and colors. However, it is the repetition that is the key. Repetition causes complacency, complacency causes relaxation, etc., etc. This one is a little more upbeat on rhythm, which would raise the heartbeat somewhat during viewing, but also quite possibly raise endorphin levels, which can lessen pain or discomfort and may also deliver a feel of euphoria. Who knows, this might actually work well for you. Give it a chance; &#34;tune out&#34; and relax for awhile.....",Positive
"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE WITH KEVIN FIRTH WAS OUTSTANDING.. TO MAKE A COMEDY OUT OF A.  SERIOUS DRAMA IN THIS CASE IS UNFORTUNATE. THE LEAD ACTRESS WAS NOT COMPREABLE TO THE ACTRESS IN THE SERIOUS. VERSION.. THE ACTOR PORTRAYING MR BEASLEY WAS EXCELLENT, AND MR BENNETT WAS EXCELLENT. . THE ACTOR PORTRAYING MR DARCY WAS GOOD,  I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE FILM..",Negative
"Out of all the new comedies that have come out in the last ten years, Sunny is as the top of my list.  You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.  As far as current TV comedies go, no one else is doing anything funnier than &#8220;Always Sunny,&#8221; and these first two seasons show it.",Positive
"This season is just as engaging, if not more so, than the previous three.  Although I cannot foresee future events, I am certain the plot will twist and it will get me by surprise.",Positive
"I watched the first episode of the last season with mixed emotions.  On the one hand, I sort of felt that Don had all his misery coming to  him-- he's been a cad and bounder throughout the series.  On the other hand, he is just pitiful, not a term you'd normally use with the unflappable Mr. Draper.  Megan has always struck me as being the most shallow character on the show and she doesn't disappoint in this episode.  I am disappointed that Weiner chose to give such depth to a character that really has none.  For example, I'd much rather see more of the now sober Freddy than this young woman who's basically a brainless twit.  Peggy's character has so many layers and so much complexity-- I've always found her fascinating.  Hard to believe that someone with so many smarts ends up in so many bad relationships.  Roger seems to have really gone over the deep end with his partying and apparent drug use and it kind of strains my credulity when I saw him waking up from an orgy with all those hippies.  Somehow I just don't find it believable. I give Joan lots of credit for managing to overcome her va va vavoom persona and am glad to see that she's taken a lot more seriously.  There's a gal with brains and beauty.  Ken has turned into something of a monster, a nightmare boss, which makes me sad.  I hope something is done about his character as he's gotten really unpleasant to watch.  As always, I'm loving the costumes and location shots.  Really great work by the crew.  I look forward to the next episodes, that's for sure.",Positive
"Hate gore, zombies, blood and guts - then go away! Love well written storylines with action and the occasional major actor death - - then get hooked on this series! Simple choice - watch one episode and you will either love it or hate it - - no in-betweens on this one!",Positive
"Love the books, love this character. I found that this segment was over much too soon; can't wait for more of this to come.",Positive
"While the show was kind of amusing, like in the first episode where they block a drain in the loading dock of their company to create a pond, without thinking of where trucks will unload; the entire premise of the show is highlighting the old stereotype of how stupid Southerners are. The Patriarch of the family who advises his grandson that it doesn't matter if his future wife is homely as long as she can cook, got my back up, and then the continuous portrayal of hunting for frogs ( a personal favorite animal of mine) beavers (another favorite) and on and on, put me off, and what might be kind of funny because the characters are so odd, just left me cold. I know people hunt to live, and there are regional specialties of the South(I live near Everglades and frog-legs are big here) I simply couldn't watch frogs having their feet cut off, skinned, etc. I almost want to take Season 1 home and give it just one more try, because there were funny moments I could identify with like when the snake falls into the boat from a tree(this actually happened to me once) and the guy goes over the side to get away. If I can watch vampires feed on people (ie; True Blood) and love it anyway, maybe I can get past all the ""political"" incorrectness by thinking of it as Archie Bunker meets Honey Boo-boo. I reserve my final analysis till after I view one more episode.",Negative
"Criminals able to talk about their crimes is not interesting. I enjoy the forensic part of the ID shows, not the emotional story of a criminal.",Negative
"I'll never understand, although these episodes are good, why does it take nearly two years to come up with 8 episodes?  It's an insult to your fan base.  Quick fu*&*ing around with personal appearances at ComiCon conferences and toy making and create some Go%&amn episodes for the fans to watch.  Hell, I'm going to turn 70 before Season 6 every sees the light of day.",Positive
"Always drama, plus some excellent cooking tips ..love Gordon Ramsay in Kitchen Nightmares also;he definitely tells it like it is!!!",Positive
"I think this was an interesting and also a very creative idea for a movie. I won't say it was not without some unanswered questions, which I can't go into without disclosing major plot points that are important for suspense factors. However, I decided to hope for a sequel or prequel that closes those and just enjoy the presentation. Other than a few questions though, the movie really moved at a good pace. It was interesting and did not overload the viewer with too much at one time. I believe in part, some questions go unanswered when a new idea is presented, because the viewer can only process so much in one sitting. Overall, it was worth my time and money!",Positive
Enjoyable sci fi series.,Positive
"My husband and I are recovering hoarders.  We met Cory Chalmers long before we had seen or heard of the A&E; Program &#34;Hoarders&#34;.  Cory and the Steri-Clean staff changed our life.  They helped us come to terms with our hoarding, and helped us learn tools to grow beyond the mess.I watch Hoarders religiously ::: to remind me where I used to be, and keep me from returning.  Change is possible for hoarders ::: there is hope for people like us.  FYI - We no longer live in a hoarded out mess, and have no intention of returning to that lifestyle.Kudos to Hoarders  for it's inspirational message!",Positive
"Fantastic acting, great writing, and an assured tone make for a fantastic show.  I wanted to watch the next one immediately.  This would be at home headlining any premium network.  Jeffrey Tambour would get an Emmy nomination for sure.",Positive

"I enjoyed this season of Storage Wars (as I do each season) because of the dynamics between the bidders.  I especially enjoy Barry and his many modes of transportation ... as well as his droll sense of humor!  The rest of the cast is engaging and it's interesting to watch as they attempt to psyche each other on bids.  Dave Hester annoys me when he 'yuuuuups' at the last second.  Grrrr.  But, it wouldn't be the same without him!  Thanks for making this show available!",Positive
I have always wondered how things are made and this show is great. I have learned a lot from this show,Positive
"Very captivating series, the cast and the detail to the era is very accurate.  The series is definately worth viewing if you like great spy series.  I do not recommend watching for children under 13 due to some scenes that contains adult situations.",Positive
I like it and am quite anxious to see the next season. Interesting take on SciFi. Don't pass it up.,Positive
"I was able to take a sneak peak at this modern day film noir on the HDNet cable channel.  Going in, the film has a strong cast.  Addison (Eric Bana) and Liza (Olivia Wilde) are siblings on the run after knocking off a casino in Detroit.  After hitting a deer during a blizzard somewhere near the Canadian border, their Town Car flips and slides down a hill killing their driver.  Addison decides (he always decides) they should split up and meet once across the border.  And on foot!  In a blinding snowstorm.  I was puzzled as to why they wouldn't take the sheriff's car who, unfortunately for him, tries to help the couple.  I mean, at least drive it to the nearest town.In any case, off they go.  Liza, nearly frozen and standing on a highway, is picked up by a former Olympic boxing silver medalist (really?) named Jay (excellent Charlie Hunnam) who has just been released from prison for throwing a pro fight.  He's headed back to his parent's home (Kris Kristofferson and Sissy Spacek) just before Thanksgiving.  Jay and Liza, well...hit it off.  For a while, rather than tell each other their real names, they make up playful ones.  Liza calls Jay, Addison.  Yeah, creepy.After alerting her brother as to their destination, Liza and Jay show up only to find Addison has gotten there first and is holding Chet (Kristofferson) and a retired sheriff and June (Spacek) hostage.  There is another subplot involving the current sheriff (Treat Williams) and his daughter (Kate Mara) who is also a deputy and friend of the family.  This plot element just seems to have been thrown in to add to the film's running time.The script is weak and we never really get much background of the plot elements given all the attempts to put them out there.  The ending is as puzzling as is most of the film.  Director Stefan Ruzowitzky does put the snow storm to good use and the photography is well done throughout.  In the end, ""Deadfall"" might be great on one of those blistering hot summer nights.  For a better, similarly themed film, try ""Cape Fear"" (either version).",Negative
"Tim Roth stars as Dr. Cal Lightman, a no-nonsense expert in lie detection who heads The Lightman Group, a Washington D.C.-based team of likeminded professionals who help solve crimes and mysteries by analyzing the facial expressions and behavior of the various individuals involved.Lightman and his partner, Dr. Gillian Foster (Kelli Williams) are primarily assisted by their young protegees, researcher Eli Loker (Brendan Hines) and Ria Torres (Monica Raymund), a newcomer who was specially chosen for her innate ability to spot lies without any prior training.Of course, a negative aspect of being so finely tuned to the nuances of human behavior means seeing things in family and friends, even when you might not always want to -- as Lightman has learned the hard way with his ex-wife Zoe (Jennifer Beals). He and Foster have an often-repeated agreement not to ""cross the line"" when dealing with one another. Yet when you genuinely care about someone, and interact regularly, it's often difficult to keep your eyes closed and mouth shut.Particularly memorable episodes include ""Depraved Heart,"" where Cal investigates the back-to-back suicides of two Indian sisters -- and reveals something startling about the reason he first got into lie detection -- and ""Blinded,"" where the group tries to find out who's copycatting a serial rapist's brutal assaults before the next woman is assault -- and one of their own is threatened.This drama provides a great blend of workplace mysteries and personal issues, as well as a number of red herrings (Lightman himself being the master). If you haven't given this show a try, please do -- you'll soon be hooked!",Positive
I like the twists and turns. Five Corners is depicted very well. Someone did some real research when they put the sets and costumes together.,Positive

"Really terrific adaptation of a fairy tale, full of action and angst, romantic with strong chemistry between the co- stars. JT is a welcome character, supplying sarcasm, humor, and his expertise.",Positive
"Let me say this first, I thought the main actress was super hot! Just wow!!!Now, onto my review. I thought this movie was pretty good for a indie film. It was made better than most indie films and some theater release ones too. The monsters were easy to do because they are just vampires and not much needed to do, but good make-up and fangs. There were a few special effects needed and they were done well. The acting was okay, some actors were better than others. The directions was okay and I only spotted one error. The story was actually pretty well done,and that's what the movie really was best at.This movie isn't really scary, and just supposed to be funny. Personally, I just enjoyed it as a better indie film. I'll recommend this movie.",Negative
"Season Four is a great return to form.What mesmerizes me is, even today, we can have a TV show without ending! Can can this be possible? If NBC did not want another season, they should warn the producers BEFORE they shot Season Four! This kind of attitude help us to never forget the obvious: the ratings are Gods. TV executives simply don't care about the quality or boldness of a show (in that sense, it was real miracle that Seinfeld survived its first season - not because it was bad, but because the ratings were very weak).We followed Earl for four seasons. We wanted to see the final destinies of the list, of Crabman, of Joy, Randy and all the fascinating recurring characters. But no, that was not to be. NBC killed it, and killed it without mercy.But why was that? I think that's because rating fell during Season Three, which was by far the worst, to the point that, in some episodes, I was wishing then to END, instead of whising they did not end, if you kown what I mean. But it was not crap by any standards, it was still above-average TV.Well, Jason Lee and Greg Garcia did their best. And it's best to finish the whole damn thing than to work with ridiculous small budgets.",Positive
Good shows I liked this one good UFO special I would recommend it I love the History channel lots of good stuff here,Positive
I wasn't sure where Season 3 would go after the &#34;Mags Bennett&#34; story line but I am pleased with the new developments and new situations. Very enjoyable.,Positive
"The guys are just growing, and if they seem different it's because they have traveled far and experienced ummm... experiences.  I still think the show is fun enough to pay for, *see me here now*  and the production quality on the Alcatraz episode was occasionally quite pretty, I got to see real San Francisco fog.  To recognize the Golden Gate Bridge, suicide capitol of the world, showed a certain intellectual curiosity.  I will never get to see San Francisco, but I think they brought it to me.  I do think they could have shown a bit more of the local scenery, this being a Travel Channel show, but it was fun.  (doesn't actually believe in ghosts but likes the show)  ;)This show caused me to make the move from the free YouTube to the pay-per-view Amazon, although the video lag is much worse. You would think if you actually pay for something the service would improve but apparently not.",Positive
This is a very good animation of iron man and the characters and story line was very good also.  When I watched Iron Man 3 and they mentionextremis and I decided to watch the animation series again and I enjoyed it very much. But it is more for mature audiences than children.,Positive
"I'm really lost on how anyone rated this more than 1 star! I really wanted to like this movie but every decision these two ""survivers"" made was illogical given the situation they were in.I sat here watching these two guys brushing their teeth for 3 minutes- then I asked myself ""wtf am I watching and why?""zombies that are so slow and weak that these two feel trapped in a car for days? he actually walked a zombie into the house to scare his friend- yet they are still trapped in a car for days? why didn't the zombies go after the guy who crawled through the sunroof and leave the car alone?the whole world is gone and these two guys only want to eat canned tuna, hit rocks into the ocean, toss a baseball and fish?a billion pairs of headphones that can be found at any store on the block and they fight over the one pair they have?every house for their taking and they live in the woods? every gun to be had and they chose a 6 shot revolver? they could take any big 4x4 truck or motor home they wanted and they chose a tiny volvo wagon? they could've traveled by atv or motorcycle but walk instead? they could've lived on a yacht 50' off shore where it was safe- but they still lived in the woods? and why were they spared the virus?neither thought of maybe finding a female to procreate with to carry on the human race? they talk about eating dogs and living off tuna but then walk by a field full of cows?neither wanted to even build a solid safe house so they could relax without fear? plus the most boring, drawn out (pull my hair out and scream) ending in the history of movies, ever! posters are commenting on the ""reality"" of the movie.... NOTHING IS REALISTIC!!!The entire premise and plot was about surviving, yet neither did anything that any rational person would've done to survive! there was no climax (except for when he was masturbating to a female zombie in the car!) gawd- this movie was so bad!this movie is just so so so DUMB!I'm sorry- but it just really felt like the director tried too hard to not make this a typical zombie film and failed.",Negative
I love this show and I really think it is so close to what really happens in the real world. Great show great cast and amusing new content each week although a great story line to follow through out the season and since the beginning. With that being said it is however constantly changing you really have no clue who is the good guy and who is the bad. I do have one complaint against the show and it may not bother anyone else. The writes seems to have all the characters repeat their lines to give further drama in a short they seem to repeat in an aggressive high strung manner what they are trying to say it seems all characters in this show do it to further stress their point. For instance they will say a line and change a few words repeat it to get you more riled up and it seems annoying to me. Olivia and her father do it the most but I have seen all characters do this in this show. I may be explaining it wrong but it is really annoying.,Positive
"I ordered the season pass to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Please confirm that is the show I've ordered and not  Vanderpump Rules. If your customers want to see Vanderpump Rules they will likely order it. I thought the new cast members would be really introduced, not all these kids who work in a restaurant from another show. Hopefully this will be the last advertising coup at our expense.",Negative
This is a terrific series. The characters and cast playing them are all top shelf as a whole. They do a great job of mixing just enough life with work life into the relationships and you really feel connected with the characters and the writing. The subject content really is compelling with such a great human element in the resolutions they try to bring into situations.. A+ 10,Positive
"With the exception of the movie version starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, I own all three adaptations of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice - the 1980 version, Pride and Prejudice (BBC Miniseries), the 1995 BBC series, Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition), and the 2005 film version starring Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyen, Pride & Prejudice. Of these, my favorite is the 1995 BBC adaptation which I've watched countless times.There's something infinitely charming about the 1995 adaptation. The casting is wonderful, especially in the casting of Colin Firth as the delectable Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. I do not think any other actor has come close to portraying the role of Mr. Darcy with such perfection and aplomb, though David Rintoul and Matthew McFadyen have both done credible turns in their roles in the 1980 and 2005 versions respectively. As for the role of dear Elizabeth Bennet, Jennifer Ehle may at first appear to be a bit too old to play the role of Ms. Eliza Bennet, but her depiction of the role is one of the best I've seen as she truly embodies Elizabeth's fiercely independent spirit and strong will (Elizabeth Garvie is my next favorite from the 1980 version, and Keira Knightley is the most age-appropriate to have played the role).The chemistry between Ehle and Firth is strong, and their verbal sparring is a joy to watch! The other roles are equally well-cast - there's Alison Steadman as the silly but incredibly shrewd Mrs. Bennet; Benjamin Whitrow as her long-suffering husband; Julia Sawalha as the flirty and reckless Lydia (the best portrayal of Lydia in my humble opinion, and Sawalha went on to star in another of my favorite BBC series, Lark Rise to Candleford); Adrian Lukis as the unscrupulous Wickham; David Bamber as the oily Mr. Collins, and Barbara Leigh Hunt as the domineering dowager Lady Catherine de Burgh. This ensemble cast comes together to deliver memorable performances that have and continue to delight audiences.Oh, and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous! Elizabeth Bennet was not the only one to be awestruck when she has her first sighting of Pemberley. It is so beautiful and stately, and appropriately awe-inspiring. The score is beautiful and one which I don't mind listening to each time a new episode begins.I have come to think of the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice as a classic, and it truly deserves this status. I know I will be watching it for many more years to come!",Positive
"This show is just getting better and better as it goes along.  Its not better than the original NCIS, but it is a great spin off.  Usually I'm not a big fan of spin offs, only Law and Order: SVU I really can say I like.  The CSI spin offs were nothing I got into but they did a great job of casting these characters and it really feels like its own show.  CBS has made some really great show's in the last 10 years, and this is a new one I think they can be proud of.",Positive

I love this show but I love the decision to make the final season a run-up to Robin and Barney's wedding.,Positive
"but I wish they'd get to the point already.  Good performances.  If you liked Lost and Battlestar, then you will defo get a reminder of that with these shows and return cast members... however, the show isn't as nearly as good as BSG or Lost.",Negative
"Normally, I wouldn't watch a show like this.  I wouldn't even be interested.  As it is, I watched the premiere online a few days after it broadcast only because I was sick, and I saw that it had Chris Egan, whom I remembered from ""Kings.""I was floored with how much I enjoyed it, and have been following the series ever since (as of this time of writing, I have only viewed the first six episodes, but that's more than enough to form my opinion on this season).  The series focuses on an engrossing ensemble cast, and the world building is quite intriguing.  I've never seen the movie this is based on (LEGION), but I've had no trouble following the story so far.  It alternates between political intrigue, character development, and chase/action.The show does have a few forgivable cheesy moments, particularly with the ""eight balls"" -- lower angels that are basically monsters, for our purposes.  That said, the show even takes the time to develop one as a sympathetic, supporting character.  It's a move that few other shows would dare make.I've seen a lot of hate for this show, because people seem to think it's too unoriginal.  Storytelling doesn't need to be original to be good, and while this has a lot of concepts I've seen elsewhere, I've never seen them put together quite like this.  It's not going to make anyone's top 10 list, but it's the best show I've seen on Syfy since ""Alphas.""  I hope it gets renewed for many seasons to come.",Positive
"The show is great.  It's geeky but not too geeky, it's funny but serious and action packed too.  I like the casting, Chuck is great.This episode sets up the premise for the entire series well and I can't wait to see what the rest of the season holds.  I'll be setting up a season pass for this one!",Positive
"A little too quirky sometimes for us experienced TV detective show watchers-- still enjoyable, just outside the realm of realistic. The female partner is, disappointingly, a weak link.",Positive
"Special effects were absolutely pathetic and there are some gaping plot holes, but the cast (outside of the French lady which was wayyyyy too cliche'd) was very fun and I would definitely continue watching as long as the Clown guy, old lady, prison dude, and cup stay untouched.  I liked their characters much more than any of be others, though the lawyer getting injured was nice.",Positive
My son loves this season and I bought this season for him so he can enjoy it again.  I rated it 5 stars,Positive
But went wrong somewhere got boring and predictable. Turned into a stereotypical small town bully story. Maybe book better not an S King fan anyway except for 11/23/63,Negative

"This is another season of the great British mystery series of Foyle's War.The series is set in Great Britain during World War II and each successive season sees the progress through the war from the point of view of the Detective as he oversees the small constabulary of his town that covers the town and its surrounds.  He is a quiet and very effective detective who is constantly observant of his surroundings and great at deduction.  He refuses to be bullied or pushed around.  He knows what his job is and what is right and will not deviate from either.He can be thought of as a predecessor of the American police detective, Colombo.",Positive
"Sometimes the less you know about a movie, the more pleasantly surprising it can be. I, for one, had no fore knowledge of ""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"" and, consequently, rather limited expectations. So when I sat down with friends and plugged ""Disappearance"" into the DVD player, I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. And for once, my pessimism about the movie's prospects were completely unfounded. After an almost wordless set-up, I was already drawn into this tight little chamber piece. Several major twists later and I was delighted to have uncovered a little known gem! With just three characters and a confined and claustrophobic set, ""Disappearance"" is theatrical (play-like, if you will) in its intimacy. But writer/director J. Blakeson uses this inherent staginess well to create a seamless thriller of lies, deceit, and plans gone wrong.I will say very little about what transpires in ""The Disappearance of Alice Creed."" Knowing the film's twists in advance may not ruin the movie's effectiveness--but, trust me, it's best just to let this one unfold. All you get from me is this--two armed and masked men take a young, wealthy woman hostage. Keeping her strapped down and helpless, they await a ransom. But all does not go according to plan, needless to say--but you probably guessed that. That's it--I'll go no further.Gemma Arterton plays the unwitting victim in this equation while Eddie Marsan and Martin Compston portray the kidnappers. Marsan is intense and Arterton is appealing, but Compston essays the most difficult role as a sort of a go-between. He is terrific, and all three actors pull their weight in this deadly triangle. But perhaps the biggest star of ""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"" is Blakeson's screenplay. Using standard thriller conventions, but tweaking them with unexpected revelations, this thriller might have lost all credibility. But Blakeson never pushes too far, maintains the suspense, and the casts brings home the show with much gusto. I really had a good time with this film and it is a definite recommendation. BUT DON'T READ THE SPOILERS! KGHarris, 12/10.",Positive
"The characters seemed weak and loose, it lacked that evil that comes from the idea of a caveman like character. Good for the little kids but not much for older ones.",Negative

"W. Dafoe is surrounded by a bunch of no good antisocial idiots up in the mountains. Not sure why everybody hates him. He is coming to hunt something. Not sure what and why.He arrives in a house with kids where the mom is depressed because her husband has disappeared. He quickly connects with the kids. Not sure what is he doing there and what is the point. Sam Neil's role is still not clear to me. Towards the middle of the movie we know what is he doing up there. Doesn't make any sense scientifically. Not sure how the genetic material will help and for what disease. The whole thing is weird and disconnected.The ending is surprising, not predictable but totally stupid. I still didn't get the message...if there is any!Very poorly done. Expected better from the cast. Two stars just for the acting.",Negative
"I love DP, but I thought that this episode illustrated how bad information can lead to unnecessary problems for individuals.  The last segment about magnetic pole shift is a common misperception.  There is currently magnetic pole drift.  This is a fact known especially to pilots who witnessed a recent 10 degree change in runway designations.  This drift is occurring at about 40 miles a year and is West to slightly Southwest.  At the current rate of drift, there is no possibility of the scenario which the last family imagined.  Moreover, even if the unlikely event of a complete sudden magnetic pole shift (the south pole becoming the north pole and vice versa), the axis of the planet would not change.  For the axis to change, the best likely culprit would be a large external force hitting the planet.  In that case, no one anywhere on planet Earth would stand a chance no matter how prepared they were for doomsday.",Negative
"&#8220;Grand Piano&#8221; is a Spanish/US thriller about Tom Selznick (Elijah Wood), a concert pianist with stage fright. After a five-year hiatus he comes back to the stage, but during his performances in a Chicago concert hall, someone threatens him to play an &#8220;unplayable&#8221; piece composed by the pianist&#8217;s recently deceased mentor. Tom failed it five years ago, and if he fails again or refuses to play now, his movie star wife Emma (Kerry Bish&eacute;) will be dead.I said it&#8217;s a thriller, but perhaps you should not take it too seriously. If you think &#8220;Phone Booth&#8221; has an incredible premise, &#8220;Grand Piano&#8221; stretches the film's credibility to the breaking point and well beyond. The film would be thrilling and entertaining if you can get past how absurd the whole situation really is. After all, why the criminal needs such an elaborate plan?Spanish-born director Eugenio Mira seems aware of that. Some may say it&#8217;s all about MacGuffin, a plot device to further the story. Some part of the film is self-referential, to be sure, anticipating our reaction to the criminal&#8217;s motives for choosing this particular method. To his credit, the film keeps tension pretty high in the earlier part. He also manages to re-create the feel of classic films, with nice camerawork.Even so, it is very hard for me to swallow the preposterous story, especially when it ends rather weakly. And please someone give John Cusack a role that he really deserves.",Negative
"First off, this pilot is beautifully shot. A lot better looking than half the half hour comedy pieces on network television today. Second, there were some surprisingly funny moments, especially the filibuster segment. And third, it's always good seeing Bill Murray pop up for a cameo. Having said that, I really wanted to like this more. Although entertained, I don't know if I'd come back for more episodes. This has more of a one-off feel to me. But hey, at least I didn't hate it.",Negative
I found the characters interesting. The premise is interesting. It was the end that really got me. I want to know what is going on with everyone.,Positive
"Humorous, sensitive and intriguing glimpse into the world of working performers - mainly those in the orchestral professions.  You don't have to be fan of orchestral music to enjoy this.

I give it a 5 because it is full of suspense and gives a little of the corrupt side of politics,Positive
"This is a great mystery series produced by the BBC highlighting the work of Inspector Lewis who is a good working class detective working in an intellectual community.  He does not relate well with the people around him both in the community and even, to an extent, his coworkers and supervisor.  They fight him at times but respect him for his doggedness and success.  This is well worth watching if you enjoy British mystery stories.  Think of a British version of &#34;Law & Order&#34; but without the courtroom portion.",Positive
"I like the saltiness of Vera and the fact she isn't a skinny, young blond!  Her sidekick supplies the eye candy and the gentleness that is lacking in Vera's character.  Definitely worth watching.",Positive
"I should not have paid as much as I did to watch this pre-theatrical release.  I did so because I thought a documentary based upon the book ""Freakonomics"" would be very interesting.  There were a number of interesting points in the film, but this is just one more case where the reviewer says that the book was much better.  The main problem I had with the film is that it presented so little information in the time allotted.  I believe this was because it attempted to be entertaining as well as the directors personalizing the content and wasting time by injecting too much of themselves into the content.  This lead to a boring documentary where I felt cheated of time and money because so little real content was presented.  I suggest reading the book and skipping the movie.  If you would rather watch a film than to read a book, then wait til after the film is released in theaters and distributed on DVD.  I do not think this film will be able to command a high price for very long after it is distributed on DVD and you should be able to rent or buy it at a discounted price.  This book is essentially about looking at common phenomina from different or non-standard points of view.  In doing so, there really is no timely earthshaking material so you will not have missed much by waiting for lower prices.  I still believe the book or the film contain perspectives that make them worthwhile, but the film barely earns an average rating in my opinion which is generous in this instance.",Negative
"Writer/director Matthew Leutwyler manages to challenge the concentration and intellect and attention span of the viewer in this non-linear and ultimately satisfying intertwining of stories that examine the bad in the best of us and the good in the worst of us. Against the backdrop of a child abduction case (person of interest is next door neighbor Beckworth (Greg Germann) we follow five days in the life of Frankie, a single parent detective (Julie Benz) assigned to the case, her best friend Kate (Elizabeth Mitchell) whose determination to get pregnant keeps her from confronting Ryan (Dane Cook) her psychologist husband's infidelity with rock singer Tara (Aja Volkman) while he is attempting to reconcile his parents (his fragile mother played by Barbara Hershey) long separation, an on-line video game addicted  school teacher Carter (Mark Kelly) and his obsession with the missing child that pushes him to the edge of vigilantism, a beat cop Jerry (Erik Palladino) grieving over the violent death of his wife, Drew (Miranda Bailey) recovering addict and her wheel chair bound brother Erik (Vincent Vinteresca)preparing for the LA marathon, and Allegra (Kali Hawk), a self-loathing African American TV writer's search for love who happens to be a patient of Ryan's (and who is on the brink of a mixed courtships with a shy and likely virginal Evan played by Zack Gifford). The string of stories asks us to look at their lives (and ours!) and to take action where it is needed to end injustice.The cast of characters is so strong that despite the rather confusing progress o the story we get to know each character very well.  The ending is exceptionally well handled.  This is one o those surprise films that appears on the surface to be one of those shallow/too much too fast director's egomaniacal art films, but by film's end the audience simply cannot fail to be touched in many different positive ways.

"Very few television series can boast that they have been blessed with the greatest production values ever, as well has having a remarkable cast and crew that knew they were making something for generations of people to enjoy. ""Rome"" is one such series. A huge ratings winner when it was first broadcast on HBO, the series is set in Ancient Rome and deals with the death of Mark Antony, as well as Ancient Rome's transition from Republic to Empire, and Caesar's Invasion of Gaul. The backdrop of the story deals with the beautiful heterosexual relationship of two soldiers, Lucius and Titus, who find their lives intertwined and who basically fight for each other, at times often to the point of risking their own lives. What I have always admired ""Rome"" for is its depiction of how close it came in presenting itself as a series that actually looks like a theatrical release. The budget was probably the highest for any series and it shows on the screen. From the sets to the costumes, the producers were not shy in their attempt in bringing viewers back to a time in European history that many did not know much about, except for those who excelled in history while in grade school or college. This set comes with 12 episodes housed in a splendid DVD case made out of thick, strong cardboard that protects the dics. The set also comes with a slew of bonuses including audio commentary, interviews with the cast and crew, and so much more. Add this set to your DVD archive as you will view it over and over. A second season is also available, either in a stand alone set or the ""Complete Rome DVD Set"". Talk is a feature film is in post production with many of the original cast and crew already signed.",Positive

I've been finding interesting older series on Prime and enjoying them.  Sometimes straight through the series.  This one is a good one.  Not to mention I like the sassy theme song (even downloaded it from the web).  Characters are good and stories are both fun and fast-paced and fresh.,Positive

"In Short: Vincent is our beast. He was approached by a secret group while he was in the military to take a serum that could make him almost untouchable. He took it. Catherine is our beauty. She is a detective with the police department. A few bizarre incidents and they are tangled together. She is working to save him. He is working to save her. They are both trying to keep Vincent a secret.I loved the earlier episodes in this season. Watching the pair search for answers about Vincent and trying to maintain their facade all while the romance is heating up was fun and exciting. And each of them has a best friend that I really like.I ended up giving it 4 stars because the &#34;on again&#34; then &#34;off again&#34; thing with Vincent and Cat got pretty old. If it stayed one way or the other for a while I would be okay, but I felt like I was yanked around a lot and it started feeling a little too dramatic.",Positive
This is a good show that I enjoyed watching.  The scenery is awesome and the characters are interesting.  I don't know enough Viking history but the overarching plot of raiding north Britain seems a little too contrived.  There is definitely an attempt to accurately portray their daily lives and I like that.  It makes the show richer.It has violence and sex but not as much as some of the HBO shows (much less than Spartacus...)Now that I finished watching the season I am curious what will happen but not as eager as I am for other shows.,Positive
"The other reviewers are absolutely right! This series is phenomenal, its got everything.You know, I expected a bunch of redneck, backward, unsophisticated Cajuns that were rippedfrom society about 50 years ago, man was I wrong. These guys are very bright, know theirbusiness, and use very clever methods to trap and catch their prey and have learned how tomaximize their profits in a short 30 day window where they are allowed to hunt gators. Imean these guys are so relentless one of the cast (Troy) even caught 39 gators in one day!The trick is to get them to market before the Louisiana sun spoils the catch, and for bigcash.One of my favorite episodes was when ""Junior"" agreed to take on a visitor from Italy, aclothing designer, who wanted to go on a hunt. This was pretty funny, as they just calledhim Itally Guy (thats how they spelled it), but he didn't cause too much trouble other thanthe catch was about 1/2 of what they normally expected. Anyway, at the end of the day Juniortold Itally Guy ""get the hell off my property"" in a very nice way and I expect we wont seehim again in future episodes.One of the things that makes this show so good is the sense of urgency, these guys aren'tplaying around and here's why...... at the start of the season, each hunter is allocateda certain number of ""tags"" for each gator they catch. When they run out of tags, theirseason is over. If they don't use all their tags, then the state cuts their allotment oftags for the next season. That makes for great TV!After watching Season 1, I have the ultimate respect for all these men, their families, andthe film crews that brought us this unique series. I've always loved visiting Louisiana, butthis is a part of the state very few ever see. I still hate LSU, but I love this show. lol",Positive

"The lively interaction between characters in this small town in the South gives rise to some hilarious !at times old fashioned comedy.  One the most adorable casts in a TV series ongoing currently. The sharply funny dialogue at times adds to the southern charm of the series. I always look forward to the mix of old and new in this enjoyable romp around the town with southern belles, two town doctors ,the attractive ex sport star mayor and the town's ever so good looking tavern owner who is one of the town's three bachelors at large attracting the ladies  who may also have been eyeing the town' s equally good looking lawyer.  In this season the female doctor brings her New York City author boyfriend to town adding to the hilarity as he tries to settle down and do his writing in the town in spite of the new found distractions.",Positive
This is a more realistic series. We enjoy tuning in to see what will happen next. I like Dean he's a perfect undercover guy. His accent his body language and his street wise attitude.,Positive

"I'm such a huge fan of Halley Berry and SciFi movies and TV programs in general, BUT.  I watched this pilot and like the overall idea, but as the saying goes, '...first impressions mean everything.'  Things I don't like about this already:  1.)  Her husband is a scientist who doesn't believe humans have souls - he insults those who believe so and likens the soul to a 'lifetime of memories' only.  I am uncomfortable with this premise on any level.  2.)  One scene shows the son and husband being shuttled to a science conference by a self propelled/piloted transport vehicle on auto pilot.  I also have issue with this as well as I hope we never succumb to this idea of vehicles as mere appliances to get us from point A to B instead of as a right of passage during our youth and a means of independence and joy.  I enjoy my ICE vehicles and would not trade them in for any EV - EVER!  Since I'm an open minded person, I will continue to give this new series a chance and hopefully the cool and imaginative plot lines will overshadow the writer's agnostic undertones.",Negative
"Haven is an excellent Sci-Fi, mystery television series that airs on SyFy. Earlier seasons can be viewed through various online outlets.Audrey Parker, a paranormal curious FBI agent, is sent to the town of Haven to investigate a strange case. Here she experiences some unusual events and a possible link to her mom. After successfully closing her case in Haven, the police Chief invites Parker to stay on with a promise of aiding in her search for her mother.Local police officer, Nathan, pairs up with Parker to solve various other crimes with weird circumstances. Parker finds more clues and Haven citizens connected to her past.What I really enjoy about Haven is the mature story line and characters. A lot of the available paranormal shows are geared for a younger, teenage type audience. This one is not. And the writing is not drowned in romantic anxiety or all the other cliche material found elsewhere. It is original content. I find it very entertaining and it satisfies my adult side.",Positive

"This season referenced season 1 a lot.  Really tied it together.  The character development is incredible, you really get to know them before the final episode.  When they filmed the final episode they didn't know whether the show was going to be resigned for a 6th season.  This final episode was worthy of its name.",Positive
"I originally wrote this review with a sci-fi fan's perspective in mind, only. I can say that after some careful consideration I've softened my perspective--a little. Here is a reiteration of the review with a little more clarity.This movie had a small budget all around. You can see that despite this they put a lot of time and effort into the film. I feel like they missed the mark with both acting and CGI elements, but there is within this team a spark that could definitely grow. They should try again, because this was NOT drivel.One of the problems that I have with sci-fi of late is the tendency to want to relate to the child audience. The big toy corporations want to sell action figures, vehicles, and play-sets; and what better way to market them then with a full-length feature film? Granted, this work is not funded by, or in league with a big toy company, but there was at least one element that felt ""cartoonish"", as in, it featured a character whose lack of musculature and detail seemed a plea for child-appeal that was, for me, unwarranted in a serious sci-fi film. It did not have the annoyance level of Jar-Jar Binks, but it was noticeable.There is a very distinct ""Firefly"" vibe to this, but the characters were either too squishy and soft, or suddenly and unlikely kung fu experts for my liking. The general/admiral/whatever he was supposed to be, got on my nerves. It is part of the actor's job to offer visual cues for the reasoning behind a character's decision-making, especially when the character is particularly severe. A perfect example would be David Morrissey's portrayal of The Governor on ""The Walking Dead"". The Governor is an unrepentant anus, but there's both method and reason behind his madness. I saw none of this underlying conflict in the military leader's demeanor.The football shot is not unique. It has been used in a lot of sci-fi movies, perhaps over-used. Even with, especially with, a low-budget work, you need to be original. Even if this movie had a patent on the technique, I'm not sure if was needed, or had the effect intended. Panning from a ""normal-seeming"" perspective to a more snazzy view became a point of ready contrast between the real and the animation. This should be a moment to hide the seams behind the curtain, not reveal them for the audience to pick apart. Less is more, smoke and mirrors, sleight of hand, all these things can add to a film. You don't have to use CGI just because you have the computers. Star Wars was a sleeper hit and used puppets, animatronics, and spliced-over film reels. What they didn't show you was just as important because they weaved it into the dialogue and the story-line.Remember the guy who called the babysitter all night, terrifying her, describing her in detail too accurate to be a long-distance call? They didn't let the audience see the goober because he wasn't really scary. What the audience didn't see was suspenseful. The director used the audience's imagination against them. That built suspense. As soon as you learned it was just some jerk with a knife it became far less climactic. He became someone into who's gonads you could strike your knee. The original Alien film was so terrifying because you only saw the creature in dark, confined spaces, and only a tail, a set of double jaws, or a claw. When you finally saw the alien you were already so invested you weren't nearly so likely to notice how curiously anthropomorphic it looked, especially in foamy extra-long fingers that didn't quite fit the actor playing it.This wasn't horror, but the theory is sound. A woman in lingerie is always more seductive than one who's just plain naked. Take the analogy of your choice and work with it.Here is what would have MADE this movie for me:1: The alien HAS to look more realistic. It can either better resemble an earth creature, or have more qualities that gave it a gritty, non-humor derived perspective. I don't think it needs to change WHAT it is, just not be a caricature version.2: The actors need to work on developing deeper internal purpose. If they are feeling happy, there needs to be some sadness and/or unrequited longing underneath. If a character is brave, the audience should feel extreme terror from that character being quelled by sheer determination. If there is a jerk in charge, he has to have lots of power and feel like he should be a little boy again, like the crown is too heavy for his unworthy shoulders, or perhaps that he earned his rank through nearly insurmountable odds and will challenge anyone who attempts to push him off the top of the hill.3: Just a little more originality. The sci-fi venue was very believable otherwise. There was a lot going for this movie, and this was the highlight. There was a feeling like this could BE an actual future setting. Steering clear of overused thematic tools could make this element PERFECT.",Negative

"In 2010, the Syfy channel had an interesting idea, to take one of Stephen King's lesser known works, a rare dramatic mystery, The Colorado Kid, and turn it into a Science Fiction story. A lot of Syfy's original shows are way out there, but Haven is more grounded and has quickly amassed a cult following. While there are similarities to the book and other King works are referenced, the show is surprisingly original.Audrey Parker (Emily Rose) is an FBI agent, who gets a tip that one of her fugitives has been spotted in the small town of Haven Maine. Parker is a terrific agent, because she knows nothing of who she is or where she came from. This beautiful, but introverted girl has put everything into her work and it has become her whole life. Once she gets to Haven, she realizes that something about this town isn't quite right, but she has no idea what she's in store for.During her investigation, Parker meets two brothers who have run the towns newspaper for 40 years. These brother show Parker some old stories from a unsolved case 25 years earlier, the murder of the Colorado Kid. Why would Audry care about it you ask, well there is a photo in the paper, showing a woman at the crime scene who could pass for her twin.With the chance to discover who she is and where she came from Parker takes a leave of absence from the FBI and joins the Haven P.D. only to discover that the town and it's people are afflicted with something known as the troubles. These troubled people, for some unknown reason, have ailments that allow them to do the seemingly impossible, such as shape-shifting, destruction with a thought, murder by shadow, the ability to star fires, even an artist who control things simply by drawing them.Parker is paired with the towns only Detective, Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryant) who himself is a troubled person. His affliction is that he can't feel anything, an adaptation of a real disease in which people can't feel pain, Wuornos can't feel a thing. Together Parker and Wuornos investigate these troubles, trying to find out what's causing them, while at the same time, Audry tries to solve the Colorado Kid case in the hopes that she might one day find out who she is and where she comes from.This show is fantastic and it's not just about the Science Fiction mystery that I love so much. The troubles are a big part of it, but there is also a great mystery to the whole thing, that is really left to the audience to figure out along with Audrey. The show is further boosted by the small town element, as Haven is one of these quaint towns, where everyone knows everyone else. It makes for some fabulous recurring guests, side stories, and the occasional hilarious moment.Emily Rose is out of this world! She has always had bit parts in TV series here and there, but she's never been a star before, but when it comes to Haven she is truly the perfect one to play Audrey Parker. She brings such a different personality to a sci-fi/cop show and the way the mystery and troubles follow her really draws the audience in.Lucas Bryant is just as interesting as we try to figure out what draws this man into this work. Sure he's trouble, but his lack of feeling has left him emotionless. At times it seems like he's doing a job he doesn't want to do, but for some reason has to.The only other regular cast member is Eric Balfour who at the ripe age of 37 is a Science Fiction veteran. Balfour has done a ton of Sci-Fi, but finds himself in a different role in Haven. Balfour plays Duke Crocker, a petty criminal and smuggler, with a terrific sense of humor, who always seems to get caught up in these troubles cases.Haven is amazing, it's just one of these addictive shows that draws you in right from the very first episode. The writing makes you feel like you're riding along in your hometown, trying to figure out the mystery along side the two detectives. Every episode is better than the one before it and it's just one of those shows you never want to stop watching. It is one of the best shows I have seen in ages and I really can't recommend it enough!",Positive
"The subject matter is appalling in itself.  It is difficult to detach yourself emotionally from the horrors that were inflicted at Auschwitz.But, it is a BBC production and with that comes thorough, authoritative, accurate and objective presentation of the subject matter.It is worth watching as an historical document and not for entertainment, which it certainly is not!  I believe everyone should see this from the standpoint of understanding what a despotic and/or dictatorial regime can accomplish if left unchecked.  When one person can rule an entire nation by personal decree as opposed to a balanced law making process, then anything and everything is possible, even to declaring a portion of your own population to be a dangerous enemy.  There are lessons to be learned here.",Positive

"People who wax philisophical about this being the Golden Age of television arent off in any way.  Never before in my life have I been around so many solidly great shows airing at once.  I'm not saying this is universal, because of course this is also the era of reality TV, but between The Wire, Dexter, Numb3rs, Lost, Californication, etc, etc, I've never before been as excited about what is possible with television as an entertainment media.  I think we have far and away trumped movies as far as overall content and originality.  Movies are all about the ""remake"" these days, but shows like Breaking Bad are about as original as you could possibly ask for.I wont really get into too much thematic elements or subject items, because I dont want to spoil one second of this extremely brief Season 1, but Bryan Cranston absolutely hits it out of the park with his portrayal of ""average middle class dad"".  He plays it so numb, then breaks bad with such force...I honestly think this is one of the performances of the year.  I'm not overstating this in any way, he's phenomenal.  He makes you so sympathetic to his plight that you really watch each episode absolutely rooting for him to best the challenging sitution he's involved in.  He's the baddest nerd that ever was.Give this show one episode, and you'll be hooked, and go ahead and set aside another six hours to marathon the rest of the series.  Its that good.",Positive
Knew nothing of this show.  Picked it on a whim from recommendations.  It turned out to be just short of riveting if you are minutely interested in the history of the era.  The ensemble interaction is just shy of perfect.  The intrigue and innuendo keeps ones interest.  Just watch it!,Positive
Falling Skies was fantastic because Noah Wyle led a stellar cast this season and Steven Spielberg was one of the executive producers on the show.,Positive
"These series are well written with outstanding acting.  I like the fact they have been able to hold the cast together, as well.  I would recommend them to anyone that likes mystery, drama and police business.",Positive
My Daughter loves Caillou. It's one of the few programs I let her watch. When the weather turns nice we'll spend as much time as possible outside but till then this is a winner for young children.,Positive
"A show, not unlike X-Files, but with genuine terror felt by the characters and realistic responses by the capable actors to the endless (and cool) strange plot features. Elements and characters that were introdued early were brought back around in a highly imaginative and compelling manner. The relatinships of the characters were developed in a completely believable fashion so as to make the viewer care about the characters and the fate of their relationships. One of the most nice crafted, executed and ended television series I've seen - thanks to the makers and performers, you left this viewer satified.",Positive
"If the pilot of a TV show doesn't blow my skirt up, it makes no sense to keep watching the program (especially if I have to pay to stream it commercial-free).I have so many superior TV programs (new and old) that I want to watch, so that means Arrow gets moved off my list.I did keep an open mind, but the storyline is old and the acting is sub-par at best.  The special effects and music are very good, but I need intellectual stimulation to go with that.",Negative
his shows are edgy but he sometimes gets a little too gross for me. A couple of the shows were extreemly funny,Negative
"When the show began I was worried as I had difficulty understanding the dialogue between Harry and his partner, but once the scene shifted indoors the dialogue was clear. That is the only complaint I had.  The show was well casted, well written and produced, and overall just so much better than the majority of network tv shows.  Well done, Amazon.  Can't wait to see more!",Positive
"Where have I been. It's like I just landed on another planet and there's great entertainment I never new existed. I'm a late comer to The Amazing Race. I'm watching the old seasons on Amazon Prime until the new season starts in February. Wow, this stuff is crazy, like rappelling off 500 foot building, Australian style! I know this stuff is covered with safety teams, equipment and emergency medical people, but it's so fun to watch. The interpersonal conflicts keep me coming back. I was sorry to see Marcus and his wife come in third. They were my favorite, after Tommy and Andy.",Positive

"It took a while to get into this series, but once we were introduced to the team, it took on a life of its own. The production values are very good and the characters engaging. It is too bad that it was cancelled after the second season.",Positive
Rylan Givens shooting bad guys and a girl.  Solid escapism.  Well defined consistent characters.  The plots are simple and reasonably effective.,Positive
"Amazon is really putting out some good pilots this year! I really liked this show. I like shows about sports teams. Sounds like a potential Major League type show, but for football. I hope this gets picked up!",Positive
It is kind of simplistic. The plot idea is good though. I would watch more of this if developed. Put some polish on it and it could be as good as anything on Nick.,Negative
"I think there's a lot of potential in Browsers.  It's an original, non-ironic musical comedy; what a terrific idea!  I just wish the pilot had more laughs.  It was plenty likable and I'd love to see more but up the funny quotient next time.  It's got the right cast, I think, it just needs more humor.  Charming as it is, I don't think charm alone can sustain it.NOTE: This is easily the most eccentric of the pilots and I'm not optimistic that it will get picked up to series.  Prove me wrong!",Positive
Not nearly as funny as it could be with the great cast that they have.. A well thought out punch line here and there do not make for a great show. Maybe some new writers might the help the show. And it only got an It's okay because of the actors otherwise it would have been one less star,Negative
"So not my top choice out of the Amazon Originals, but this was more entertaining than Glee. The acting was excellent for the most part; the only thing I could not work out was how in the world the producers managed to find the one black guy who can't sing! Actually, neither can Brigette Davidovici. But replace those two, and you got yourself a top notch show!",Positive
"I love how they tell two or more stories in one segment, And they are based on true events. I have always liked it when they survive and love survival shows.",Positive
"If I was ever going to get arrested (again), I would really like it to be Kiera!! The woman has it all ~ face & full body sexiness!!",Positive
"I don't like Arrested Development and I love Girls; so I was on the fence at the beginning of the show.  The nudity seemed like it was trying to copy shows like Girls; but most of the time it was oddly out of place and didn't need to be there.  I almost stopped watching it because I didn't like the siblings at all - but then, with 10 minutes to go - it got interesting; with the Dad's story line.  I'm not sure if I would watch this as a series - the attempts at cleverness are obvious and annoying.  It seemed a little like the show &#34;Brothers and Sisters&#34; on acid; which I mean as kind of a compliment.  It's not a definite for me; but if it goes forward, I'd be willing to check it out again.",Negative

"Aftershock (Nicol&aacute;s L&oacute;pez, 2012)Man, Aftershock got excoriated by both the media (as of this writing it has a 35% critical rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and the public (26%), hasn't it? Now, I will be the first to admit that I can be easy to please (though my movie reviews are pretty close to a bell curve, so make of that what you will), but, well, I kinda liked it. It wasn't Hostel, but then, the same week I watched Aftershock, I also watched Daydreamer, Order of Chaos, The Oxford Murders, Apollo 18, Five Dolls for an August Moon, and Appetite, and all got lower ratings than Aftershock. So it's not like I'm watching these things in a vaccum... it seemed to me that L&oacute;pez and Guillermo Amoedo (Retorno) took the seventies disaster flick and the naughties survival horror flick and combined them with pretty darn good results&#8212;nothing spectacular, but certainly not bad.Pollo (Que Pena tu Vida's Nicol&aacute;s Martinez, doing his best Zach Galifinakis impersonation) and Ariel (Promedio Rojo's Ariel Levy) are a couple of Chileans hanging out with a friend they affectionately call Gringo (Inglourious Basterds' Eli Roth). After some setup that really is one of the movie's weak parts, the three of them find themselves in one of Chile's sleekest nightclubs, a marvel of underground engineering...that is the worst place in the country to be when a massive earthquake hits. (There have been tremors in the film previously, dismissed by Pollo as nothing out of the ordinary. Oops.) Also trapped with them are some lovely lasses the predictably socially-awkward guys have been hitting on (there's an interesting romance subplot that begins to develop between Ariel, the non-party-guy of the trio, and the straitlaced older sister, but that takes a backseat to survival, unfortunately). However, once they get out of the collapsing nightclub, they discover that they might have been better off staying underground.No, there's nothing new here. But the combination of old is interesting, the characters are stock without being stereotypes, and there is real tension to be had in some places where it is unexpected. It may seem as if I am praising with faint damn, and that is accurate; I enjoyed the movie without being wild about it, so I'm trying to be restrained as much as I can while still saying &#8220;yeah, you should watch this and ignore what you're hearing from everyone else&#8221;. It's not breaking any new ground, hardy har har, but as far as being a mildly interesting disaster flick with survival-horror elements, it fills the bill. ** ",Negative
"Excellent series, this whole third season builds to a tense climax that has left me really wanting and hoping that there will be a season 4. This series does become an addiction, the paranormal, the back stories and the characters building and maturing throughout. The main characters become old friends that you care about. Would love to see this series continue.",Positive

"I haven't laughed so hard watching a show in years. It's about a New York mobster who goes on the witness protection to Lillehammer, Norway of all places. Norway operates in no way like the mob culture this man comes from. He gets a fake name of Giovanni and it's hilarious to watch as he makes his way on his terms in a society completely at odds with his philosophy to life. There are many other cultures that are represented in this show.The show touches on things that are not just cultural, but rooted deep in the human nature regardless where you come from. Such as the reaction towards misconduct of one trusted public official, who is entrusted with integrating people into a new culture.Quite a bit of the of the show is in Norwegian, it has subtitles, but if you don't shy away from foreign language I highly recommend this show. And well, if you are Scandinavian you will understand most of the dialogues and you will see your culture from another point of view. Great acting and a Great show.",Positive

The special effects were great If you realize they are coming from the garageThis is for Sci-Fi fans who want to make their own movies.",Positive
"I enjoy a series with a solid plot that's tight, good actors that pull off their role as believable and have a few surprises along the way.  Crisis does that very well.  I was shocked when I heard that it will not be getting renewed.  That is a clear mistake as far as this viewer is concerned.  Major bummer.

"This was the last film I saw with my father before he died (the first was Bambi) and it is a beautiful end of life meditation on the things that are truly important.As the allied armies are retreating from Italy, a mysterious man  only known as the English Patient, who is suffering from severe burns all over his body comes into the care of a lovely and kind Canadian nurse, Hana, played by Juliette Binoche. She takes the patient off a military convoy and seeks sanctuary in an abandoned house where her present becomes entwined with the English Patient's past.The two timelines are beautifully shot by Anthony Minghella, blue and crisp for the Italian springtime scenes, warm for the desert past. Some of the loveliest transitions in all of film occur between the two time lines--similar sounds, similar sensations, a phrase which jog the patient's memory  are the means which  transport him back to his past.As Hana recovers from the brutality she has seen during the war, she finds romance with a Sikh demolitions expert. The two lovers are from very different backgrounds but find a simple joy and common language in being young, hopeful and fully alive. The English Patient, not English at all but Hungarian Count, Lazslo de Almasy, a member of a geographical expedition mapping the desert,  initially suffering from amnesia, slowly recalls his own most important love affair with a married Englishwoman prior to the outbreak of the war. The count is quite a different species from the two young people. He is by turns brilliant, sarcastic, prickly, passionate, cold and filled with regrets.Fiennes and Binoche are at their best and are joined by excellent Willem Defoe as a thief who has been relieved of his thumbs by the Germans. Naveen Andrews as Kip, the demolitions expert, Kristen Scott Thomas and Colin Firth, as the married couple between whom Almasy comes, give standout performances. Fantastic script based on the Ondaatje book, superb direction and a hauntingly beautiful score make this an exceptional film.The opening scene of the airplane flying over the desert mingling with the cave paintings of the swimmers backed by the mesmerizing Hungarian song Szerelem, szerelem [sung by Marta Sebastyn] is a cinematic classic. I've seen the film a dozen times and still love it.  Highly recommended.",Positive
Except for Thomas and Sarah this is definitely one of my favorites.  Never boring.  Very good shows. The actors are pros.,Positive
"While I like seeing how things are made, this show is NOT really much about the how, so much as it is about the 'putting it together' after parts are already made elsewhere. They show us a few steps, while leaving out MANY others just as important if not more so than what they DO show us.  And thus, it's too short. WAY too short. Seeing up to four or even five 'things' made in 23 minutes? Come on! You can't expect me to know how a firetruck is built in only 1/4th of the whole 23 minutes!! Not even if they used all 23 minutes for that one item! It's far too complicated a build. They barely scratch the surface on almost everything. That's the bad. The good? Well, they DO have a wide variety of things that they get access to, and will sometimes slow down a critical process (Slow Motion) so we can understand it. That's what they are doing right. They do make explanations for some of what they don't show us... Though that's limited to statements such as: ""Now he will place in the pump, already built in another part of the factory"", or maybe another factory altogether. Likely, China, which they seem to avoid saying. That's 'The Putting Together of Already Manufactured Parts. AKA: This is more about 'Assembly! And NOT much about ""How it's MADE""! I wonder if they think the audience isn't clever enough to understand it? I would pay for it, but not at the same price as say, a full one hour show on a single subject. I think pricing ought to reflect that. No wonder it's in the 'free' (with paid membership) to PRIME members... (Technically, that's NOT 'Free', but I quibble) Except newer shows, no matter their type or length, are (almost) always excluded from PRIME... Up to several years worth. (Usually three). This show ought to be part of Prime right up to yesterday. (If there was one aired yesterday, that is) Buy it at your own discretion. Personally, I want more detail and less ""How many things can we cram into 23 minutes"" kind of stuff... Could YOU build a light bulb in 23 minutes? Even WITH the equipment? I know, editing... Marketing. Argh! I think this show is 'dumbed' down to what they THINK is their audience's lowest common denominator. An insult to every one of US, who DO watch it, and really DO want to know: 'How DO They Make It'?",Negative

"First of all, I must say that I LOOOOOVE Jamaican accents.  If you find them exotic and cool, then you will enjoy hearing these interviewees.  At first, I assumed that they spoke similarly.  However, if you contrast a police officer with a dancehall performer here, you will see how socioeconomic issues may play into speech.  The speakers would use ""him"" when ""he"" is correct or ""we"" when ""us"" is correct.  As many may know, Jamaicans pronounce the H in ""herb,"" rather than leaving it silent.  Actually, if you love the scenes of Jamaica filmed in the Black American flick ""Belly,"" then you should like this doc.In some ways, this work disproves stereotypes.  The narrator says 1/3 of Jamaicans have tried weed.  That means the majority of them haven't touched it.  The narrator said 29,000 Jamaicans follow Rastafarianism.  That is actually a small percentage of the 3 million people that live on that island.  I was reminded of my own Black American community when a weed seller says to a customer, ""It's ghetto style!""What was deep was how interviewees worried about their communities.  One person said he didn't want to sell drugs, but that was the only way he could afford medications for his grandmother.  Another said, ""I wish Jamaicans just did rum and weed like in the past.  If only we could leave items like ecstasy alone.""  Off the top of my head, I want to say all the interviewees were male.  The doc doesn't spell out if Jamaican women stay away from the whole drug scene.The work shows lots of dilapidated structures.  It showed folk wondering how they could make money outside of this illegal trade.  It showed people worried about the fate of their community.  I just saw much here that made Jamaica look like what goes on in several African-American communities in my country.",Positive

The show centers around a vampire, a were-wolf and a ghost.  Both the vamp and the were work in a hospital and decide to share an apartment.  They find shortly after moving in that the place is haunted by a female ghost who was murdered by her fiance.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good paranormal story line.

This is an American adaptation of a British series that is still running after four seasons.  I'm hoping the American version holds up as well.",Positive
"This show used to be everything one could hope for in Reality TV.  The characters were real, the setting was real, the &#34;action&#34; showed real process.Sadly, with this season, the producers rolled out a new over-wrought title block and a new production outline that has substituted fakey acting and dialog for the old idea of showing the process of &#34;Restoration&#34; at which they used to be so good.Now the show has devolved to be just another gabfest, and largely a waste of time.Its just sad.",Negative

Kind of just there to look at and admire how charming and pretty she is. I don't feel she's been given enough to do compared to Amy Pond. This is only the beginning of her journey and I look forward to following that journey. I would recommend that people give this half season a try because we all have different taste. I will continue to watch until the season finale, but after that I don't know if I can continue purchasing such low quality episodes.",Negative
I enjoyed Main Street because it was look not too far back in our history.  It was well written with just the right amount of drama played out by the different characters.  The characters for the most part were not related; yet the story line covered each facet of life from the old to those just getting started in their adult life.  Another thread of the story line was progress in commerce&#8230;a familiar thread in the fabric and making of America.

"As a movie, this film was heartwarming, as well as a tear-jerker, no doubt about it. The acting was excellent, with the child-actor who portrayed young Colton,; believable. However, if you're looking for &#34;factual&#34; information on NDE's (Near Death Experiences) and/or, Scriptural proof of the existence of Heaven, I personally do not believe Heaven is for Real should be taken as absolute and complete evidence to support the movie's claim.The book with the same title, on the other hand, is a much more in depth and detailed ACCURATE account of 4 year old Colton; who had experienced an NDE only after he had DIED in the hospital after being several days with extremely high fever as  the poisonous toxins from of a ruptured appendix rushed throughout his little body. Also, the book adheres more to the truths that are found in Biblical Scripture.So, the bottom line: iIf you're looking for a feel-good, have-Kleenex-handy type of film, then this is it. If you're expecting to find definitive proof of the existence of Heaven through the eyes of a child, this is . ..not it.I do, however, recommend reading the book.",Negative

Because this review has said everything you need to know.Well besides the fact that the acting blew my mind.  And the casting.  And the script.Alright. Haha",Positive
First off Jackie Christie is such a fake and this season she has found her some minions to follow her and a couple of them must have a little bit of hood rat in them.  I watched 2 shows and decided that this season is a waste of time so I won't be renting any more.  Maybe next season you will bring back some of the original cast and it will be worth watching.  Please get rid of Jackie.,Negative
"I have thoroughly enjoyed ever EPISODE for the above reasons, plus the plot holds you in suspense resulting in fun surprises.",Positive
"I genuinely enjoyed this show. At first it might not make sense for the family to get powers after an airplane accident, but that is explained later in the season, no biggie. One of the things I liked about this show was how the family developed their powers and learned to use them or gain new facets of their power, like Daphne's mental abilities. I really am sad this show was cancelled.I do spot something that I would have done differently (spoiler alert) In the last episode of this show, Ms. X talked about power permanence and trying to figure out a way to attain a permanent power. She decides to give a planeload of criminals permanent powers after forcing the secret out of J.J. I see one problem with this - former employees of King and Ms. X were forced to report back to them for regular shots of Trillsettium, which kept them under their control - no 'medicine', you die. Power permanence means that these criminals would not be dependent on Ms. X, causing her to lose power over them. She should have done the procedure to herself instead of criminals who you know would just cause more trouble after the fact.",Positive
"I hope that Amazon Will make a first season. Oddly, about a week after watching the pilot, I saw a picture online that looked a lot like the &#34;entity&#34; that appears near the end, which makes me wonder if there is some truth to this.",Negative
This is especially good if you have spent time in the wilderness.  Any wilderness.  Beautifully and hauntingly done.  Glad I watched it.,Positive
"Even the second time around!  I watched it during the regular season, but it was frustrating to wait week-to-week.  Binge-watching this show is awesome.  Matt Rhys is cool, but Keri Russell is incredible.  So strong and yet so feminine.  She is my forever-crush!  Great cast (Margo Martindale, I love you!), great writing, great production value.  Can't wait to Season 2!",Positive
My husband watches this he likes it. I am not into science fiction so I don't really like it it's fast moving,Positive

"Already perched on the mountaintop of cinematic stories in the first two seasons, the third actually raises the level of excellence to new heights. Much of the characterization  the initial seasons developed so well actually becomes still more integral in this, the third season. I became more invested in the safety and sanity of what I have now begun to view as colleagues - their varying motivations, whether well-considered or foolish, with pride, joy, fear, or disapproval. WIth so many human issues being addressed and so many characters involved in simply dealing with the hardships of their trying life, I'm now feeling, as I watch, that I'm living it with them. At this point I find myself wishing the series will never end!",Positive
"Loved the first season. Was looking forward to the second season and the new wrinkles in the equation. Recognized some story and plot inconsistencies with the Green Arrow character in the DC Universe, but minor. Didn't expect Slade Wilson to be back. Totally unexpected and, I think, unnecessary. Sure, lots of things happened for 5 years in the island, but let's move on now to the present day and let the dead remain dead. Was looking more towards encounters with the League of Assassins, but I guess the script writers like nothing more than staying on in the island.",Positive
"I was a fan of the show as a young girl, and had resisted seeing the new edition of Dr. Who for some time.  Now, 8 years after its birth to our new television viewing audience, I can see what all the fuss is about.  It took me a day and a half to watch the first season, and if how quickly I viewed those episodes is ANY indicator of my opinion on the show - well, lets just say I am HOOKED!  I was sad to see Eccleston (The 9th Dr.) go so quickly after only one season, but Tennant as the regenerated 10th Doctor was a surprise I was not expecting.  The writing by Russell T. Davies is exceptional!  This storyteller weaves a tale that is a tasty mix of old Sci-Fi, fun new worlds and new characters, and a touching love for humanity and hope.  Tennant's range of emotion in a character who could have been hardened by time, has a love for the Planet earth that can never be explained.  Everything is new, and the things in the world that could be perceived as odd or frightening or dangerous, he sees with the eyes of a scientist saying things like &#34;You're MAGNIFICENT! and Just look at YOU - you're BEAUTIFUL!&#34;  Additionally, like every lonely traveller, the Dr. needs a companion who he finds in the more common part of London.  The lovely Rose Tyler proves to be more than a pretty face.  Born with a spirit for adventure, this couple makes traveling the universe fun and exciting.  And of course....what unsuspecting young girl wouldn't fall in love with such a lonely yet exciting man of the universe.Though some of the special effects are a bit cheesy, that seems to have always been the basis of the 'fun' in the show since the '60's.  I can't say enough about how much I have enjoyed watching the second, third and fourth seasons of Dr. Who.  The departure of Russell T. Davies as lead writer and David Tennant as the Dr. were indeed a sad loss for the show.Rating - DEFINITELY SEE THIS SEASON....",Positive
The first few episodes of Season 1 were a little bit slow but bit by bit the series became more and more interesting. The last tow episodes just leave you wanting more. I can't wait to watch Season 2.,Positive
"shows on TV right now.  I've been loving Supernatural since the first episode and Sam/Dean have really grown in the series.  From fledgling demon hunters to full on demon killers, but still at the same time keeping that thing that seperates us from them...their humanity.  Yes, he sold his soul to save his brother and that is one of the major storylines in Season 3.  As the brothers race towards finding a way to undo this pact that has been made.Not knowing what lies ahead for them it never stops the Winchester brothers from having a blast doing what their Dad trained them to do.  It's violent, dark and grown up, but at the same time its light hearted and funny to watch.  Supernatural isn't like any show out there and that's what makes me love it so much.  Especially after the Season 3 epic cliffhanger, I can't spoil for folks that haven't seen it yet.But wow!  It's something else and will leave you wanting Season 4 to hurry and come out on DVD asap.  I love all the characters in story whether recurring (Bobby) or not.  They all make this show something special and kudos to the writers, producers, directors, set designers, lighting effects, custome designers and everyone else work on the show.  Thanks for making Supernatural just that.",Positive

"A lot of set-ups, but that's OK. Takes all kinds to make the world go around. Like to see it in person.",Positive
"I confess I was not aware of Ann Sothern's work until I saw this.  Decent comedy and overall enjoyable.  Be aware the plot descriptions I see listed seem to be off on several of the episodes.  So watching them can be a surprise.  Oh yeah, one episode has a very young Harry Shearer....watch for him.",Negative
"Sorry to see that this show had only one season.  I really enjoyed the &#34;his & hers side of the story&#34; format ... & how, after the verdict came down, the viewer was always let in on who actually committed the crime, irregardless of whether the jury got it right.  The only thing that was a bit irksome (as I did not find it plausible) was the sexual attraction of many of the male characters in the show to Kathryn Peale, who reminded me of an ex-nun, given her hair cut & dress.  I just didn't see it at all.",Positive
"This is a truly fascinating documentary, and it's subjects can be equally appalling and appealing. My reactions to the White family ran the gamut from pity, compassion, disgust and anger, and often ended back on compassion for these dirt-poor, fairly uneducated people. After watching this film, I don't think the White family is actually scamming the system much when it comes to the social-security checks, because I think they ARE all certifiably crazy!!! However, they should certainly be prosecuted for their drug offenses, assaults and murders just like everyone else. Although I did feel compassion for Kirk when she lost her baby to Child Protective Services, I was relieved that the state took her baby, because CLEARLY she is quite an unfit mother. I feel terribly sorry for her little boy who has to stay with her. (I have wondered if the state of West Virginia would end up taking her son away from her after watching her behavior on this film). I felt so bad for the Matriarch of the White Clan, Bertie, because she is so obviously a good Christian woman for the most part. It's obvious that there is a lot of love for each other in this family, but they have all turned into a band of criminals. It's a shame that Jesco hasnt been able to make an honest living from his dancing, which I found fascinating to watch!",Positive
"As a stand alone program this is a good one. However, as a representation of the characters created by Thomas Harris I think they have gone off the rails a bit. In the book Red Dragon, and the two film adaptations of that novel (Manhunter and Red Dragon), the Will Graham character has a gift, is troubled, but certainlly has the ability to function normally in society. Harris' character is married, has a child,and with a few exceptions has the ability to live a normal life. The Will Graham portrayed in this treatment seems fragile, off balance, and one step away from a full mental breakdown at any point in time. Brilliant at profiling but socially incapable of functioning normally in society. As a supposed ""prequel"" to the events in Red Dragon, I just don't see how this Will Graham becomes the Will Graham of the novel.They've also really missed the mark on Jack Crawford. The hard ass character that Fishburne is portraying is again, inconsistent with the Crawford of Red Dragon and SOTL. All that having been said, still an intriuging show to watch.",Positive
"Losing key characters has been a real heartbreaker for us diehard GA fans. Although the show has turned somewhat darker, the acting and character interaction is as mesmerizing as ever. I don't know how much longer the show will continue, but I will continue to watch with all the sadness and joy this wonderful show always brings.",Positive
"I like the story line, it's different from the old tv show, but it could use a little more touchy, feely emotions in it.",Positive
"The show is produced well, with some great reenactments that will creep you out.  Especially at night.  The best part of this show is the variety of strange creatures supposedly encountered by people all over the USA.  The scary part is that not all of them can be lying or mistaken!Great show, with seemingly earnest and terrified people recounting strange encounters that will freak you out.  Lots of fun.  Worth buying if you are a total monster maniac, otherwise worth watching at least once!",Positive

"I don't know how they do it. Each season just keeps getting funnier and more twisted. I don't care how much time they take between seasons, it's worth it.

"An above the norm spy / conspiracy thriller with a non-formulaic plot line and a pace more suited for British audiences, and generally perceived as slow in the US.Well written and acted, though sadly without enough car chases, explosions, or gratuitous violence for North American TV, & thus not renewed it appears. I was sad to see a rare intelligent series, albeit slow at times not allowed to grow.",Positive

"Solomon Kane (Michael J. Bassett, 2009)Been sitting on this Solomon Kane review for a lot longer than usual; I'm writing this on December 14, 2010, and I actually watched the movie back on October 16. I kept putting it off, trying to come up with something compelling to say about this movie, but a couple of days ago I realized that was never going to happen there is nothing compelling about this movie. It's a Sci-Fi Channel original on steroids and with marginally better production values, but it's basically a Sci-Fi Channel original Movie nonetheless.Solomon Kane (Resident Evil's James Purefoy) is a former mercenary who, after the particularly vicious sacking of a town, loses his soul to the devil. As a result, he renounces his life of violence and retires to seclusion in a monastery in the remote countryside. All well and good until the monks decide that, given the state of his soul, he's too much of a threat to keep around. They toss him out on his ear, and while traveling, he falls in with a band of merry travelers, the Crowthorns. Father William (The Usual Suspects' Pete Postlethwaite) is a caring sort who scoops Kane up off the road whilst he's injured and unconscious, and as he recovers, he gets to be friends with the rambunctious son, Samuel (Patrick Hurd-Wood, real-life brother to Rachel), and there's some hefty sexual tension with the daughter, Meredith (said Rachel, recently of An American Haunting). All goes well, again, except that, you know, the devil is on his tail, and he must eventually realize that pacifism is probably not the way to go in the face of so implacable a foe (and said foe's henchmen).The most impressive thing about this flick, hands down, is the cast. I didn't mention Max von Sydow, who plays Kane's father, though he generally looks lost during his two minutes or so of screen time. Nor Alice Krige as the matron of the Crowthorns, and Alice Krige, like Pete Postlethwaite, is always a welcome sight on a screen. Or Jason Flemyng, perhaps the least-known, but most talented, of the stable Guy Ritchie made Lock Stock... and Snatch with (a group that has given us, among others, Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones). Philip Winchester (Camelot). Ryan James (The Illusionist). The list goes on. There is a heavy load of acting talent to be found here. And collectively it does the best it can with a tired script, adapted by Bassett from source by Robert E. Howard.Do people never learn? Has there, to date, been a single decent movie adapted from Howard's work? (Let me help you out with that one: no.) Tto flicks, two TV series, and four video games, and no one's figured out how to do Conan the Barbarian right yet. And we'll not even mention Red Sonja except in passing. (But we have to pause and snigger at Kull the Conqueror, which at least revels in its awfulness.) You have to blame this, at least partly, on the slavish devotion people seem to feel to Howard's work; no one is willing to update away the archaic attitudes, take into account differences in expected pacing then and now, that sort of thing.Don't get me wrong, in the world of Howard adaptations, it's clearly the best of a bad lot, and if you're looking for a generic actioner with supernatural elements, you can do a whole lot worse than this. But classic cinema it is not, and from the gushing of some reviewers, you might be expecting it. ***",Negative

"A new television series is testing the waters - GANG RELATED intends to examine the Los Angeles police force and its connection to the Mexican cartels. It opens brutally and the first episode suggests that action brutality will be an ongoing theme - as well as a divided allegiance between a tie between the police and La Familia.Every villain has a noble cause, and every hero has a dark side. In the gritty new action-drama GANG RELATED, Detective Ryan Lopez (Ramon Rodriguez) is a rising star in Los Angeles' elite Gang Task Force. What the world doesn't know is that long before Ryan became a cop, he pledged allegiance to a different band of brothers - a powerful Latino gang called Los Angelicos. When Ryan's best friend and police partner is senselessly killed by a notorious gang member, Ryan teams up with longtime Task Force member Cassius Green (RZA), who has been at the forefront of the city's war on organized crime. In this war between law enforcement and gangs, the series explores how only people who really know the streets can win the battle on the streets. Despite his profession, Ryan is still beholden to the gang's leader, Javier Acosta (Cliff Curtis), the father figure Ryan has tried to make proud his entire life and the man who masterminded his entry into the police force. It's a secret that has been held for a decade by Ryan, Javier and Javier's sons: cold-blooded gang lieutenant Carlos (Reynaldo Gallegos); and Ryan's childhood best friend, straight-laced investment banker Daniel Acosta (Jay Hernandez). But Ryan is starting to realize that he is even more dedicated to being a cop than he is to Los Angelicos. He is respected by his team, including Tae Kim (Sung Kang), Veronica ""Vee"" Dotsen (Inbar Lavi) and Task Force leader Sam Chapel (Terry O'Quinn), Ryan's other surrogate father figure, whose estranged daughter, Jessica Chapel (Shantel VanSanten), is the city's Assistant District Attorney. Ryan's education comes from the streets, and that schooling will work to his advantage, as he, Cassius and the rest of the police unit take aim at the city's most dangerous gangs. While balancing two allegiances, two father figures and two families, Ryan's increasing sense of loyalty to one will help him finally determine which side of the law he is really on. Nicholas Gonzalez has an uncredited role also.Time will tell as to how much of this tenuous line will persist, but the actors are fine and Ramon Rodriguez seems to be able to handle the important lead role very well.

"In ""The Samaritan"" Samuel L. Jackson is Foley, an ex-grifter set free after serving twenty-five years in jail. While he finds solace in living with a young, drug-addicted girl Iris (Ruth Negga), Foley is forced into a swindle by Ethan (Luke Kirby), whose dead father was once Foley's partner in crime. And Ethan seems to know some secret about Foley that even the former confidence man does not know.The film is best described as a film noir. Like some of the classics of the genre (""Night and the City,"" for instance), the twist-filled story revolves around our anti-hero with a criminal past, who dreams of a better life with a woman he loves, and whose plans may go wrong at any time. The difference is that Foley is not very willing to take part in the scheme, as money is not exactly what he is after.Samuel L. Jackson delivers an effectively restrained performance as a tired ex-con man whose only concern is to stay out of trouble. But trouble follows him wherever he goes. He is a sort of a person who, while running away from one predicament, runs into another bigger and nastier one, and Samuel L. Jackson as that person is convincing. The interesting cast includes Gil Bellows, Deborah Kara Unger and Tom Wilkinson.""The Samaritan"" is flawed, however, and flawed in more than one way. For those who have seen a certain Asian thriller (which should remain unnamed here), the idea upon which the plot of ""The Samaritan"" rests may appear a familiar one. That itself didn't bother me as writers David Weaver (who also directs) and Elan Mastai have developed it in a totally different way, but the ending is disappointment because the dilemma and complexity Jackson's character faces are sorted out in a too neat fashion.""The Samaritan"" is a crime thriller that requires a pretty big suspension of disbelief at some scenes (and I am not just talking about the genre conventions). Once you get past that part, you will find the film a thrilling ride with Samuel L. Jackson's strong performance.",Positive
"Teaching isn't an easy gig under any circumstances. But, when you're Henry Barthes, in a crap-hole like this, it's darn near impossible.Here's the scoop. Henry Barthes is a substitute teacher who's had a troubled childhood. He likes subbing so he doesn't stay attached to anyone or any place. He's on assignment in a tough, inner city school. He wants to make a difference but fears he cannot. He helps a young prostitute and does what he can with both his students and fellow teachers, while looking after an aging, sick grandfather living in assisted care.This is a very powerful movie with a lot more grit than ""Up the Down Staircase"" or ""To Sir with Love."" These kids are tough, mean spirited and not afraid to get in the teachers' faces with cursing and threats. Barthes (Adrien Brody) seems to work well here. He knows that standardized teaching is out the door. He needs to reach them so he uses unconventional methods to do so. They don't spend a lot of time in his class, but they spend enough to show his methods work. He has a knack for reading a situation and playing it correctly. He takes in, against his better judgement, a young (teenage?) prostitute who responds to his kindness, but this puts him in deeper than he would like. He prefers being detached.This is a heck of a movie. Brody has had a few mis-steps in his career but he does an outstanding job here. He found the voice in his character and stays on beat the whole time. There is a strong cast of back-ups as well. Marcia Gay Harden, James Caan, Lucy Liu, Christina Hendricks among others fill in the gaps very well. Sami Gayle as Erica, the prostitue, does a really good job for someone early in their career. The music is good, the writing, editing, cinematography etc. are as good as they need to be to make this happen.This does get heavy handed at the end and leaves some questions unanswered, but overall this is about as good a film as you're likely to see on the subject.",Positive
This show involves very appealing characters involved in entirely unrealistic spy adventures.  But it's really fun to watch each assignment progress.  When bad things happen the edge is taken off so the entire family can watch.  I would recommend this show to anyone.,Positive
I know this was a true labor of love for everyone involved!! What an effort it must have taken to get so many of the original cast members back for a movie after all of this time. Great show and a GREAT MOVIE!!!,Positive

Every single one is special in their own way...I guess that's why they're called Christmas specials, not Christmas episodes.

"The Colony an experiemtn in what would happen when a group of strangers must survive in a post apocoalyse world.  This season the major threat was a viral outbreak that has left much of the country if not the world on the brink of total collapse.Seven people quarrintined after seventy-two hours have been taken to a compund area in which the next fifty days they must find food, shelter, water and whatever else they need to survive this new world.  Along the way they must deal with outsiders, dwindling resoruces and other threats to thier very exsitance.This season was the first I saw on tv and when it came out on dvd I grabbed the first and watched them both.  I am a bit torn in that since season two was the first time watching it I was amazed at what they were able to do i nthe fifty days and at the same time amazed at what they should have been doing fom the begining. Hello security anyone?  The people themselves are a divrse lot with those you want to watch and those you wish they would just fall into a hole and never see again.

For example, there was an episode where the group went to a huge hotel that sat on 20 acres and I didn't feel like they investigated a acre. Nor, do I think any of them use the equipment that they are provided properly or frequently enough. I watch this because I watch all paranormal shows, but this isn't one of my favorites.",Negative

"All roads for Vic Mackey (Emmy winner Michael Chiklis) lead to this. After Mackey killed Terry Crowley during the first season of ""The Shield"" karma was going to catch up with him sooner than later and now the Strike Team is under I.A.D. investigation by Jon Kavanaugh (Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker). Mackey seemed on the road to redemption during the fourth season when the new captain (Glenn Close)gave him the chance to reassemble his team and make a difference in the Farmington police district. The investigation that she instigated which was designed to exonerate members of her team has turned into crusade where Kavanaugh will use any and all teams to bring down Mackey and his team.By the fifth season of ""The Shield"" I was afraid the show would jump the shark--in fact it has done anything but that with writing that is still among the best on TV with morally complex characters sporting shades of gray to their personalities vs. being simple black and white caricatures of good guys and bad guys. Chiklis proves as he has over the last four seasons to be one of the best actors on TV with his complex portrayal of Mackey. Chiklis though wouldn't be where he is without the terrific supporting cast. During the fifth season Mackey's nemesis begins to resemble him as he tries to bring down Mackey and his team. Mackey may be morally corrupt person but there is still a decent person buried somewhere within his soul which allows fans of the series to be rooting for him even if he is often the bad guy (hey, he killed a cop in the first episode of the first season!).The show looks grainy and dark which benefits the cinema verite/documentary look of the show with its handheld cameras and unexpected pans. As always Dutch(Jay Karnes) and Claudette (CCH Pounder)continue to be the moral center and conscience of the show and as fascinating as Mackey and his team are, these two detectives are equally as fascinating as they bring down a serial killer with perfect alibies and other difficult to crack cases. The politically astute former Captain of the station David Aceveda (Benito Martinez)continues to have a darkness to his ""moral"" character particularly after the physical assualt at the hands of an ex-con that occurred during the third season.The DVD has some great special features including commentary tracks with a nice mix of cast members, a featurette on the productio of the fifth season, a tribute to executive producer/director Scott Brazil who died during the sixth season and a Q&A; session with Chiklis, producer/writer/creator Shawn Ryan and Forrest Whitaker discussing their characters and the development of the series. We also get deleted scenes as well as the sixth season ""prequel"" that sets up season six.The seventh season (which will air this spring)is reportedly the last season for the show so if you've caught the bug for ""The Shield"" but fallen behind in watching the show, now you can spent time either catching the reruns or watching the DVDs in plenty of time for season seven.Highly recommended.",Positive
"No, I can't put it in the same league with West Wing, but how many shows are?  This move fast, has great humor, plots and characters, some of which you may have at first despised only to find yourself having a little affection for... Oh, and sexy too.",Positive
Walt Longmire is a &#34;Man's Man&#34; and does things his way. I love this character driven show and all the characters are GREAT!,Positive
My kids and I enjoy watching this show together. Pretty funny show. Lots of slap stick comedy. Just don't get hung up who is doing the voices compared to the movies.,Positive
This is one of those best shows that should have been on longer than it was.There is only one season of this series and there should have been more.  I don't know why it  left the air so soon because it is one of  the most consistently entertaining series ever.  I have watched it over and over and still laugh.,Positive
"I wanted to get an inside look at some the things on the show, but it devolved into a conspiracy theory show rather than a &#34;behind the scenes&#34; look.  Three stars for entertainment value.",Negative
"Considering that this is about a bunch of commie b*stards, this is a pretty good show.  Good and believable acting, especially with that lady from Justified.",Positive
"Season 6 arrived in the midst of much outrage over the departures of Mary Birdsong (""Deputy Cherisha Kimball""), Wendi McLendon-Covey (""Deputy Clementine ""Clemmie"" Johnson), and Carlos Alazraqui (""Deputy James Garcia"").But let's get real for a minute. Each of these characters represented one-note solos, much like Neil Young's ""Cinnamon Girl,"" but in a much less effective way.Kimball: ""Is she or isn't she?"" If you're like me, you stopped caring.Johnson: ""Round round get around I get around""...yes, Deputy Johnson got around, and the joke grew a long, gray beard.Garcia: Set-up for low-rent Hispanic jokes. 'nuff said.We still have Dangle, Travis Junior, Wiegel, and Jones...the core of the ensemble...and that's close enough for rock and roll. We also have ""former sex slave Cindy""...the wonderful and gorgeous Wanru Tseng...so while the glory days of the series may be in the past, having the show around for another season is nothing to sneeze at. ESPECIALLY when the season opens with Dangle proclaiming ""I thought we were canceled!""Reno 911 is an acquired taste. I thought the movie really missed the mark, and was the only true failure so far. Season 6 won't displace the prior 5 seasons as ""best season ever"" by ANY means, but if you are a fan of those seasons, it is ""glass half empty, glass half full"" time.I was personally grateful to have 15 new episodes of one of the most irreverent TV series of all time.",Positive
I can't get enough of this show. Jax is changing his character and we are really finding out who did and does what!!,Positive
This show isn't just for kids; anyone can enjoy it! It's hilarious and often times non sequitur. Great story lines in this season particularly.,Positive
Same as the original storage wars but with a colorful Texas twist. Love the down home accents. This is a keeper.,Positive
"Dino (Dominic Cooper), the darling of Mt. Kisco, NY races formula cars. Everyone knows Toby (Aaron Paul) is a better racer, although he just street races...except for maybe Anita (Dakota Johnson) his ex-gf who now travels with Dino. Through a series of impossible circumstances, Toby gets arrested for stealing Dino's uncle car, which he didn't. Upon getting out of jail, he will travel from NY to California in 45 hours aka &#34;Smokey and the Bandit.&#34; Imogen Poots takes the role of Sally Fields. He is going to participate in an unsanctioned, &#34;winner take all&#34; pink slip race. Oh yes, he is on parole too and can't leave NY and must drive three times the speed limit to make it in time. He doesn't quite make it by ground and needs to be lifted by a friend in a helicopter for the last leg...something they should have done to begin with. He now must face Dino in the race.This whole script was stupid. The first thing any investigator wants to know about a stolen vehicle is &#34;Where are the keys?&#34; The idea that hot chicks hang out at a drive-in for local race drivers instead of texting their bff all night is old school and made me ask, &#34;When was this film made?&#34; Dino is a great philosopher, &#34;Forget the past. It's history.&#34; He also makes up all kind of ridiculous Anita puns. They also have an aircraft fly overhead for safety, i.e. let them know when there is traffic, but that information didn't seem to effect their driving as they sped through red lights in a cop-less town.The personalities ranged from bland to bad. 130 minutes of mostly car action, not much in the way of building a believable tale.A preteen or young teen film. A tad more believable than &#34;Death Race 2000&#34; but not nearly as entertaining.Parental Guide: No f-bombs. No sex. Male rear nudity.",Negative
"Great story line. Great acting. Great suspense. Keep it going, please. But tell Harry to slow down on the smoking. He's going to kill himself soon.",Positive
"It tries way too hard, but I still hope more episodes are made because maybe they will find their way.As other reviewers have noted, this seems to take pages from Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Strangers with Candy, and Workaholics. They only real difference is, it's just not nearly as funny as any of those.Perhaps if the show shifted focus to the black secretary it would be more interesting and waaaay more entertaining. She's great!Hang in there guys, keep at it but just relax a bit. Find your own voice. Don't try to replicate Always Sunny, you can't, you don't have Sweet Dee.",Negative
"I enjoyed looking at another lifestyle for which people live.It is interesting to see how people  live off the land, while most of their work is survival.  There are some city folks who still do some of the same, food gathering and storage, hunting, outdoors activities, but most is provided by services. Where the services  for these people is by their own hard work.The people in &#34;Mountain Men&#34; rely on other people to help out in certain situations.  They rely on community help in different circumstances, some due to government regulation and others wildlife movement or weather.I enjoyed the personal commentary or narrative given by the people.  I felt like I was there with them visiting.This series can be a motivator to those who live in a city to get out in the outdoors once in awhile, noting some of the preparation that is needed to be outdoors in the wild along with some of the dangers involved.It's a good series.  I'd like to see more shows that deal with different lifestyles of the outdoors with some glimpses of personal struggles and successes.",Positive
"I knew very little about the Viking era when I started watching the show, but I am finding it enthralling, and it has prompted me to start reading up on the history of the Vikings--always a sure indicator of my interest. The writing is intriguing, and the Viking world they have created is fascinating. Ragnar, the central character, is both a man of action and a thinker, and the supporting cast are all equally compelling. Ragnar starts as a farmer with a navigational secret that will transform his world and launch Viking exploration of civilizations that were shut off from outside interference for centuries and will never be the same again, nor will his own society remain unchanged!",Positive
The soundtrack is awesome. The acting is first rate. The story is convoluted. The show is so intense at times its hard to watch.,Positive
I love this show!  I like the main character and glad to see she has a love interest which to me makes the show more interesting and realistic. I also  really like the concept of a woman being the &#34;bad guy&#34;.  I really hope the network will give this show a chance to thrive.,Positive
"I just can't get by the various English accents in this drama set in Italy, with supposedly Italian characters. And why, if all the men have British accents, do all the women have Italian???",Negative
Good plots set in Rome for a change of locale as a change of pace. Experience Brits with Italian accents! The series could have been longer.,Positive
"I enjoyed the plot twist and the ending.  It was thoughtful...very 1984.  In some cases, I don't think we are too far from the scenario.  Would like to see Volume 2.",Positive
not a stephen king fan and almost did not watch this because of that.  some episodes were rather tedious and the storyline seemed to get muddled occasionally but overall entertaining,Positive
My kids love this show! We have a smart TV and are able to stream it. The stream was seamless... you wouldn't even know it!,Positive
I love British television and this to me is as good as it gets. There is never a bad episode. The characters are so realistic I feel like I know them. They don't come any better than Judi Dench.,Positive
"This show isn't about feelings, but one of the best scenes in tv history makes two actors at the end really stretch their credentials. Shane and Lem really pull it off. The noose starts tightening for the strike team and their cheating ways.",Positive
"We love this series.  This is one of many interesting episodes.  It is great to see James Spader in a role he is well suited to do.  He can be good and bad and show a complicated man with the best of them.  This episode showing a vigilante bent on torturing parents that beat their children added another facet while seeing Spader tracking down the mole in the agency and exacting justice made it one of the best.  I love the fact they add &#34;real&#34; music to the series, this episode has Johnny Cash &#34;The Man Comes Around&#34; and Junip &#34;Line of Fire&#34;.CA Luster",Positive
"It is sad, but I couldn't watch it with my kids, because of the language and some of the videos with nudity.  I really think it should be rated PG13",Negative
Did they just stop updating this series? there are way more episodes to this season than are available here on Amazon.,Negative
"Yeh, Mary was off her game. It was predictable after the comments of her growing boobs and increased appetite. I have been to Pennsylvania and been to Intercourse among a few other towns with hilarious names. I love this show. It has so much imagination; with every conceivable situation.",Positive
I enjoyed the relationship between Castle & Beckett. I really enjoyed the show where Castle's father showed up. The show where Ryan and his wife was also very good.,Negative
There are many shows out there that seem very much the same but I can't say the same for this one. I don't watch as much television because shows don't hold my attention for long and I am not sure where this one will go but so far I can't wait for the next season. So these people got isolated from their surrounding by some strange dome which appeared out of nowhere with no warning. Sometimes I am not sure about the supernatural parts of it but not to where I want to turn away from it. The cast of characters is interesting as their story unfolds and skeletons come out of the closet. Not sure if this is a good vs. evil kind of thing or some kind of moral test of the characters but so far I like it.,Positive
So far I do like it.  I haven't finished it yet but I plan too soon.  It was a fairly good watch.,Positive
Grimm has great personalities and terrific storylines.  The outlying Portland area really is shown to best advantage in these episodes.  Hope this one continues forever!,Positive
...I'll watch the next episode. Full of time-worn and predictable dialogue and old jokes. It's on par with major network sitcoms.,Negative
We loved watching this. It was edgy and  captivating. We highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Britmysteries.,Positive
I missed the first episode of Betrayal & was able to buy it & start watching within a minutes. I love Amazon video downloads.,Positive
"the store receives some pawns that are old, artistic, motorhead, canons, vintage guns and much ..much more..it's nice to see some comedic interactions with store workers also..",Positive
"The geeky indian just feels like an Abed knockoff from Community. I didn't care about these people. The wiseass had his moments, particularly in the bathroom talking about his age (although I would peg the actor as being closer to 45 than 35 in real life)I liked the ValetMe app idea better than the BRB one. An app to help you find parking spaces would be really helpful.",Negative
"I just finished watching all Alpha House episodes. The show is hilarious, even though I am a Democrat and the main characters are Republican. It is a comedy or drama, but all characters seemed believable. I could not stop laughing out loud! Plus I am a long-time fan of Mark Consuelos (and his wife Kelly Ripa). Garry Trudeau created an entertaining, satirical series. I look forward to the next season.",Positive
"What a clever premise!  A sociopath with serial killer tendencies is spotted at a very early age by a seasoned police officer (while the child is up for adoption).  The Officer adopts the child and takes the opportunity to carefully ingrain in him that he is ONLY to kill others like him...serial killers....who have managed to slip through the system and remain free.  Dexter learns to be one of the best blood spatter experts at the police station.This is extraordinarily interesting as Dexter narrates his inner most thoughts, and we get to learn how a sociopath, with no empathy or understanding of how ""normal"" people feel, navigates through society mimicking how people behave.  That is fascinating.  The acting is dead-on and the writing is crisp and taught.  My ONLY issue with this series is the foul, gutter mouth of Dexter's sister...it is so extreme that it feels like slaps in the face.Really good television.",Positive
I love this season with all the intrigue and new character especially Hill Harper role! Annie has really been great this season I love Piper in this role! Keep Annie and Auggie together!,Positive
It was pretty good. I'll definitely watch the other episodes. Especially enjoyed Jeremy Renner. He's a pretty good actor and does a lot with his various roles..,Positive
"Should you spend your time and money to watch a Syfi Channel series.Surprisingly, this one is considerably better than their regular programming.The production values are higher,this series has a much more &#34;polished&#34; look.Even the special effects are a step or two above the normal Syfi series.Fans of Anthony Michael Head need to use extreme caution before viewing this series.The one thing that keeps this from being five star is Anthony Michael Head.Many of us are fans of this British Actor. We loved him in &#34;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&#34;.We loved him in as King Arthur in &#34;Merlin&#34;.  In this series, however, every time he opens his mouth, you want to run screaming from the room. He speaks with his own unique version of an &#34;American Accent&#34;. So badly done thatYou immediately realize he is an &#34;Actor&#34;.... And not a character.",Positive
"One of the best sci-fi series to be aired lately. It goes right into my Star trek, Babylon 5, and Battlestar collection",Positive
"90% of this shpw is better then good. It really gets your attention. Personally, I like  Kate!But that is my choice. Buy the set you will  not be sorry.",Positive
Started watching the show when it first came out... was amazed then with the focused on habits of people to see if a person is telling the truth of not.,Positive
"I'm officially addicted to this show...great character building, great storylines, and love these actors! Can't get enough of this show....",Positive
I think that Sponge Bob has a wide age range that it appeals to. Adults can even get some laughs from the show. I find this to be this generations Looney Tunes (Bugs & Co). The writing is always good enough to keep you in each episode. I find it funny that 2 year olds really take to this guy and even learn how to say Bob Bob....Watch it sometime see what you think.,Positive
"How many sports programs can you say are successful? EXACTLY!!! &#34;YPB&#34;  It's your problem bro, as the character says in the show! Monkeys and cocaine taking left overs from the Hang-over franchise is real sad! Natalie is kind of hot right now, this show is not the get ahead for her! Are Amazon's viewers sports fans, enough to carry a whole season?",Negative
"This series is fantastic. The acting is superb, the plot is realistic, and FINALLY Sheriff Longmire is a character of actual integrity - a true modern-day hero worth admiring.",Positive
"&#34;Almost Human&#34; is shorter than &#34;Cloverfield&#34; and has around an 8-minute end credit sequence solely to be long enough to be entered into the festival circuit. This may make it seem like the sci-fi horror film is rushed along, but its fast pace is actually fairly comfortable and it fits the film very well. The film draws influences from some of the most respectable cult classics. The opening credits and the film mostly taking place in the middle of the woods gives it a &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; atmosphere while the music seems like the forgotten score John Carpenter never released. As the film progresses, you're immediately reminded of &#34;The Thing&#34; and &#34;Halloween&#34; during the final act. The violent, murderous rampage also has some better than decent yet not quite great gore thanks to its practical makeup effects.It's difficult to root for Seth though because he's so twitchy. While Jen seems to have forgotten everything that happened the night Mark disappeared, Seth just wants to wake her up to the nightmarish sights and sounds he does remember. He isn't heroic and he doesn't want to save anyone. He just wants his life to go back to normal after Jen told the media that he was behind everything and it ruined his life. In other words, Seth only cares about himself.There's this entire sequence where Seth doesn't seem to understand anything anyone is telling him. He mutters the phrase, &#34;What's that supposed to mean,&#34; several times in less than five minutes. Mark always seems to ask questions without giving anyone a chance to actually answer. He asks a man cutting firewood why he's living in his house before blasting him with a shotgun and thrusting a hatchet into the back of his skull before the poor guy can give an actual answer. Seth is trying to load a rifle while Jen is in trouble. He&#8217;s rushed and in a panic, but can&#8217;t seem to get any of the shells into the actual gun. So he just throws the entire supply on the floor. While the film has several positive influences, the other influences aren't so great. &#34;Jason Goes to Hell&#34; is passable since the acting in that sequel is some of the best in the &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; series, but &#34;Almost Human&#34; is a lot like &#34;Dreamcatcher&#34; at the end of the day and that's something no film should try to ride the coattails of.&#34;Almost Human&#34; would be a decent first film for anyone, but its abrupt ending and familiarities hurt it more than anything else. Nothing is really explained by the end of the film and you're left wondering why aliens have a thing about turning our televisions on, making prank calls, turning the lights on and off, and possess impregnating elongated mouth funnels. While &#34;Almost Human&#34; pays homage to some truly great horror and sci-fi films of the past, it fails to really personify its own identity and it crumbles under the weight of paying too much homage without building its own foundation.",Negative
"Not that interested in this season, not sure why.  Just writing this to get it off my reviews-to-do page",Positive
"Amazon apparently wants us to rate these pilots to see which one(s) get made. Well, as far as I'm concerned, this is the one! Great acting, great story line. Tense, but with a good rhythm of action mixed with intrigue. I really want to see this series!",Positive
Leverage is getting to be a gamble to watch.  This one is slow and boring and I'm sorry I spent money on it. I hope they figure out that when people are paying per show they at least need to hold the viewer's interest.,Negative
"Adam Cayton-Holland (the Spanish teacher) was the best part. Most of the casting/acting was pretty weak. I presume they were just casting their friends in those parts. The writing was solid, so hopefully when the show gets the green light, the execution will be a bit better.",Positive
"I just finished watching another EXCELLENT 50 or so minutes of Undercover Boss. So far I have watched all but the first episode (which I will get back) and the second one (Hooters - no need for me to bother) and what can I say?? For reasons I don't have time to share now (but will later) I THINK THIS SHOW IS WONDERFUL!!!! :)If I had children (especially growing teens) THIS is the show we would be watching on Friday nights!!! (Of course, it would be followed by a fun movie or an evening of games.)What better way to encourage discussion then to see the unscripted (whoever did the research -- thank you very much; I was wondering about that) lives of some Americans who are STILL working hard -- day to day -- expecting NOTHING from ANYONE! Granted, I often wonder how many people they don't show, but the ones they choose to show?They inspire me to continue to believe that American isn't becoming like the third world country I just got finished spending 4 years in. They remind me that there REMAIN some who have will and determination to give their best in order to accomplish what they ARE being PAID to do.What more can I say? So far, so good!Thank you (producers) for giving me hope in the midst of a world full of deteriorating ""entertainment!""",Positive
"I started out as a big fan, but some of the twists and plot turns are so ludicrous. My interests has waned since the whole memory-loss issue. Aiden in/Aiden out/Aiden back again...when all our hearts really wanted was for Jack and Emily to fall in love forever.",Negative
I love this show and these personalities that make their way through &#34;history&#34;.  They seek to uncover truth and get justice in knowing the truth.  It shows what people can bring to this need and it shows how far they will go or where they will draw their lines.  It is full of energy and acknowledgement of human frailties and courageous strength of mind and character.,Positive
"Out of all the attempts at a believable show with fantasy species' I think this is one of, if not the best. The special effects are good, there's not a lot of detectable superfluous CGI and there's an ongoing, engaging story line. It's both campy and fun. I also like that there is a same - sex relationship and it doesn't have that persecuted, preachy, 'look at us' undertone. The acting is good and the characters are well developed.",Positive
"Like the first VHS, this one delivers some of the most imaginative horror cinema out there.  But these shorts rely a bit more on special effects, and lack the first's twisty surprises.  Out of the four short films, the third, Safe Haven, stands out.  It offers the most meaty premise, gives the most time with the characters, and ultimately quite the hellish fantasia of a reveal.  Overall it is still a fun, but slightly less effective horror collection.",Negative
"few minutes of this, which was a very brief overview of the show ~ I would have to see a couple episodes in order to have a different opinion.",Negative
"I think these programs are a fantastic thing and I wish they would actually be more strict with the kids when they have them in there! SERIOUSLY scare them.. when they are in there all giggling and smirking, wipe that right off their faces!!",Positive
This show is really witty and I like how he pokes fun at his guests without them even being aware that he's mocking them in front of his viewers.  Like all of his nudity too!,Positive
"For a show that is supposed to be a comedy I only laughed a few times.  Drama and making fun of programmers seems to be the main focus although I wonder how many people will get the jokes.  There is a girl, there is stressed friendships, there is looming defeat.  But hey it's a pilot so who knows?  I would like to watch a few more before making a final decision on this show because they end it with an upbeat, positive outlook that makes me wonder what else is in store.  Great cameos.",Negative
Adventure Time!  This season adds more depth to the already wonderful characters as well as some great twists to the plot.,Positive
I thought it was a pretty interesting flick that I enjoyed for what it was. Glad to see that someone could make something dark the revolved around Disney and showed that not everything is right in the magic kingdom. This movie is straight up psychological horror so if you don't like those kinda movies then stay away from this one. Has moments that are great but also bogs down a lot at times. Would I recommend this? Only o diehard movie fans that wanna see something different. Overall I don't think it's a great movie but I like it for what it is and that's an experiment. Check it out but be warned of its weirdness.,Positive
"This series is great because it has suspense, great plots, and the good guy wins in the end, although he may get beat up pretty bad. Raylin is a tough guy with a good heart, and just wants to do the right thing.",Positive
family love to sit down and watch this together. Love Hiro! Kids really enjoy the show as well as us adults!,Positive
Westerns will never die. This is a real western set in the eastern part of the U.S.A. The Timothy Oliphant is flawless. The show is priceless entertainment. I love it. Hope it goes on forever. Elmore Leonard's short story has achieved classic TV proportions.,Positive
"It is not typical horror movie and about horror , it is a life drama , story about ""let go "" from the past and present , interesting movie, there was moments that scared me as well as they was unexpected but the meaning of that you should understand when you finish watching the movie . It is not easy if you have no experiences , but for those that know how it feel to lose someone it could be clear what the movie was about.",Positive
Fantastic movie.  I love the story line and the characters are all strong and you just never see the next curve coming.  I would like to see more shows like this on Amazon Instant.,Positive
"I got hooked on ""Hannibal"" very quickly.  The acting of the leads is truly superb.  Thecharacters of Will Graham and Jack Crawford couldn't be better.  Hugh Dancy's convictionis unmatched in TV acting, and Lawrence Fishburn brings movie star credibility to theshow.  As for Hannibal himself, when I first heard about this show, I thought there'd beno way anyone could do anything with the character other than tarnish Anthony Hopkins'legendary portrayals.  But from the first episode, I was fascinated by the job MadsMikkelsen was doing.  By the end of the second episode, I was hopelessly enamored with theshow and anxiously anticipating the next week's installment.  The writing is fantastic,and of course the gore goes much further than any network drama I've ever seen.  Duringthe season, I was often surprised by how much leeway the show was given to depict thegruesome murders committed by Lecter and various other serial killers being hunted by theFBI.  I was overjoyed to hear that ""Hannibal"" got renewed for a second season, and nearlycrushed by the news that I'd have to wait until summer 2014 for it to start.  This is agreat series, and if the quality stays as high as Season 1, I'd love to see creator BryanFuller reach his goal of adapting all of the Hannibal novels.",Positive
"What a thriller ! I like this series better than the book ! , and I loved the book. It all comes to life on TV every Monday night. My kids and I look forward to  this show so much ! Excellent characters & great acting. I wish more of Stephen King' s books were adapted to movies. He is the master of suspense !",Positive
"Modern conspiracy theories are common these days, but they've been with us forever, as evidenced by theories about missing Ninth Legion of the Roman Empire. Centurion explains what happened to the Ninth from the point of view of someone who was there.Our hero, Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) becomes part of the Ninth's destiny when Picts overrun his garrison. He escapes, only to discover that Roman governor of Brittania, Julius Agricola (Paul Freeman), has committed the general of the Ninth Legion, Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) to eradicate the Pict threat.  Their secret weapon is Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a mute Bringantian scout.  With his inside knowledge, it's not long before Dias acts as Virilus' right hand man against the Picts. SPOILTURION: If you know your Roman history, you know this isn't going to end well.Legendary Roman discipline fails in the face of the devious Picts and a surprise betrayal leaves just a handful of men alive.  When they discover Virilus has been captured deep in enemy territory, Dias and his ragtag band form a desperate rescue mission. Along the way the men bond and betray one another, as each falls to privation and violence.This is a gritty movie with few likable characters.  Children, prisoners, and even cooks are murdered as a matter of expedience. The main antagonist has no speaking parts, which makes for an unusual villain.  Most of the movie takes place in the sweeping countryside, a character unto itself.Centurion is more interested in legend than fact.  The Picts are a conglomeration of everything Romans ever reported about them - women warriors, lime in the hair, blue battle paint and all.  This at least makes them more interesting than the typical dirty barbarian types that usually act as villains in films of this sort.Unfortunately, Centurion's plot is as serpentine as a Roman column.  There are long stretches of countryside views that, while beautiful, begin to drag. The audio is muffled - I'm starting to think is a problem endemic to outdoor war films, because King Arthur had the same problem. When Dias finally decides to stand and fight, it's an exciting battle...and then the film limps along to resolve two other major plot points.  The script could have used more polishing.What it lacks in plot, Centurion tries to make up with gore. This is a crazy-violent movie, with more gore than most horror films.  One of the first battle scenes has so many limbs chopped off, heads sawed in half, and gurgling throat cuts that it really detracted from the movie as a whole.  The bloody effects -- an artifact of the movie 300, which seems to have made every producer assume they can get away with CGI blood - look cartoony.  At one point, a guy's head explodes when he runs into a tree.All this adds up to an ambitious but uneven movie.  Centurion tries many different things and only succeeds at half of them.  But the half it succeeds at makes for a decent film.",Negative
I didn't think the series could get any better but this season was better than the first 2.  So much more of the characters and the stories got even better.,Positive
"I'm just not into dead people walking. The Bible is a work of fiction that began controlling this world ever since it was written 2700 years ago (old testament) but the Bible was finished with the worst book of them all ""Revelation"". The idea that people are going watch this series and enjoy it makes my skin crawl. Sleepy Hollow series, I fear, will not die just like the headless horseman.",Negative
"I was watching a documentary on horror films in the U.S. the other day and while I watched I realized something. There were actually few if any true horror films are being made these days. Granted there are films made that qualify for the genre, but most are more obsessed these days with how far they can push the envelope, how much gore they can include and how disgusting they can make the world seem. Far too many have chosen to go the Rob Zombie route of showing us homes in decay where dirt is far more common than cleanliness. I for one would find it more terrifying to see a serial killer in a well kept home than the unwashed, unbathed louts living in trailer parks more frequently seen today. Then I watched THE INNKEEPERS.The Yankee Pedlar Inn was founded in 1891 and has seen better days. The last weekend the hotel is to be open two clerks are working taking care of just three customers. Claire (Sara Paxton) is an early twenty something working at the inn with no outlook on her future. Luke (Pat Healy) is a laid back older guy who lives at home with his mother and has no future prospects as well. The pair has formed a friendship while working at the Inn and share an interest in the history of the locale as well. Said to be haunted, Luke has set up a web site based in incidents that he has recorded while working there.On this, the last weekend, the pair hopes to finally catch something worthwhile to include on the site, a real paranormal happening that can be verified with two people on hand. Checking into the hotel we find a young mother and her son, staying to avoid her possibly soon to be ex-husband. Later we have a movie star who's seen better days, Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis), here to speak at a convention nearby. Lastly we have an elderly man (George Riddle) checking in to recall the good old days when he came here on his wedding night. But the guests are secondary for the most part though they play important roles as the film winds down. It is the spirits and the search for them that make up the scares here.Claire and Luke take turns watching the desk and taking care of the needs of their customers. When not working, they sleep or attempt to record EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), recordings of spiritual voices in the room unable to be heard by the human ear. During the times when Claire searches for signs of the afterlife more happens than with Luke. It seems as if the spirits are trying to reach Claire for some reason.Star struck by Leanne, Claire displays the usual fan klutz attitude. But later the two have the opportunity to talk. It turns out Leanne isn't in town to speak at an acting class or fan fair but to speak about her newest calling, healing via crystals and the like. Assuming the role of medium, she tries to help Claire with the search for the main spirit in the hotel, one Madeline O'Malley. Murdered and her body hidden in the cellar for 3 days by the owners of the hotel at that time to avoid bad publicity, it is said that Madeline continues to walk the halls of the hotel. In attempting to contact her, Leanne offers sound advice to Claire: don't go in the basement. Any guess as to where Claire goes?Between bumps in the night, a piano that plays itself and several other scares the film does indeed offer some truly frightening moments as it plays out. The first third of the film offers little in the way of horror with the exception of a few jump moments, scenes where things make loud noises causing the viewer to jump. But as it progresses it tells a tale that evokes some haunting images and a story that slowly unfolds to bring about real scares.The acting is wonderful here, especially from the two leads. They don't appear to be actors at all but two people who work at the most boring of jobs, leading boring lives in search of something else outside of their own level of comfort. When the world they seek appears to be coming alive, their terror seems real as well.The movie is slow paced but wonderfully so, never rushing to get us somewhere but letting us take in the whole view of the hotel and its history given in bits and pieces. The need for gore is absent and that makes the scares even more disturbing. Horror films that allow you brain to fill in the gaps make for much scarier viewing than simple effects. This film offers the thrill of the old horror film and that's something it should be proud of. If you want to see how a horror film can be done right, then by all means check this one out.",Positive
"When this series first aired I thought it would be a typical clone series of Friends or Joey or the like but to my surprise and happiness I found it actually has a talented and entertaining cast who keep the series more enjoyable as each season comes out.  I like how it plays on the seemingly stereotypical lifestyles of the vastly intelligent but socially awkward and socially talented but slight less intelligent academically and not always in the same group as you would think.  Many people have wondered if the series has a laugh track like some of the early 80's to mid 90's shows, while you do hear laughter it's actually from an audience rather then a mechanical laugh track.Still if you find it annoying to hear laughter in some of the scenes then this series is one you might want to pass over, while it doesn't distract you from what's going on in the scenes more then half the episodes will have for obvious reasons laughing in them. If you're still unsure of the series I'd say get the first season especially for the price it's going for and see whether or not you will become a fan as I highly suspect or this is a series you'll want to pass over either way I still say the series is worth a try.",Positive
Monk was a very good show. I have enjoyed all of the seasons and this was just as good as the rest. Very well done.,Positive
"This is a review for Video on Demand. This, in no way, is meant to say that the service is lacking. It is a great one. this is reviewing the movie.In the city, strange things are taking place. At first it seems like nothing more than some shadow play and a bit of urban migration, but that turns to panick as the numbers go up. Overnight, people literally leave their homes and vanish, taking nothing. As the mystery here deepens, so too do the reasons to why this is taking place.When I first saw this advertised in the pages fof Fangoria, I was immediately shopping for a venue to watch it. That was a couple of weeks ago and I should have written a review then, perhaps saving some people money. I apologize for that but I normally do not do the negative route. Still, this is a terrible way to fleece peolple with a good idea and terrible execution.What you have here is a tale of two proverbial cities, with one going off greatly in the storyline department and then taking a sudden turn and going down boring Street. I know - I have been there before and recognized the signs. I watched it with two other people as well, and they concurred. A lot of things went wrong and made this awful.You start with people going away in a weird way and people asking why. The main actors hang in there through this, and it all seems good. Then you have some of the scenes that try to keep people out of the shadows, some that made it seem as though the world is really hard to understand, and even when the vanishings start to make sense it hurts to watch it progress. The writers are at fault in a lot of this, and the direction hurts as well. What you have is an "" o no, avoid that shadow"" story mingling with a really boring output from the actors. Overacting is a theme as well as trying to make you scared of the nothing that is really not menacing, and it gets old fast. Really fast.I wish I could say something better but, in the end, I don't know how. What I do know is that you should not et this and, for 10 bucks, you should heed all the warnings out there. This is about a 1.5, with the .5 coming from the beginning. Hopefully that says something aobut it, and hopefully you feel safe and avoid it.It isn't the dark you should be afraid of, after all. It is a movie about it.",Negative
My child loves this show and is learning from it too.  Definitely worth checking out for your toddlers if  you have any.,Positive
"I watch this series on SCI Fi channel when I can, but have missed many shows over the seasons.  Therefore, I find it great to be able to fill in the blank spots by watching the show in order.  I plan to buy more seasons and watch them all.  The idea that a vampire, werewolf, and a ghost can live together is unique and makes for interesting storylines",Positive
"I watched this because I have a deep interest in Roman history. I may have been spoiled because I had watched ""Rome"" before this one, and in comparison this production seems very . . . well, much less polished and well produced.I was not impressed by the acting or production. All together it seemed rather mediocre.",Negative
"This is the last season of a killer sitcom! Its a shame it has to go! I have to have it for my collection, and so should you baby!",Positive
Heat of the Sun is a riveting film with a tight plot and an excellent cast. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.,Positive
"I found the pilot of &#34;The After&#34; to be fun to watch ... but it reminded me of LOST in that it could and did go any which way it wanted to always trying to be interesting and hook the audience.  The end result of that we found out after 7 years was not too much and something that did not hold up.  If there is a point, and it can be drawn in and eventually closed in some satisfying story way, I'd watch it ....  but I can't really go positive or negative without knowing what it is about.",Negative
"I like the show, its kind of like the ""Invasion"" and ""Lost"" and ""Anaconda"" all in one, kind of,... but hte damn camera cut scenes makes me dizzy, and hard to concentrate on whats happening",Positive
I like watching his show. He gives a lot of new ideas to think about. I hope to see more seasons added.,Positive
"The folks who made this movie were trying for a scify horror story that,1,doesn't show any understanding of science ( you can't clone a human from red blood cells-they have no dna ),and,2, tries to go for horror with a 'The Shineing' rip off.What they do succed in is regurgitating anti abortion propaganda, and do the disapearing good christians in the rapture bit.A 'mad scientist' wants to clone people, why his project is protected by soldiers is anybodies guess. A woman fertility doctor who can't have children steals one of the cloned embrios and implants it in her womb in the womens toilet. Cut to 'seven years later'. The boy heals a dead mouse. Mother takes the boy to see the 'mad scientist' who by now has had a religous conversion and kills his family so they can go to heaven. He smothers his wife with a pillow and smothers his little girl with a teddy bear. Their bodies disapear leaving only thier clothes behind, just like all the people in the church did.'Mad scientist' was trying to clone jesus! Wants the boy to forgive him! Shoots mom whos body disapears. But, oops!, the boy isn't Jesus, he's the anticrist. Movie ends with him asking satan a 'knock knock' joke.Don't waist your time on this; theres nothing new or well done here.",Negative
"This was interesting for the series to go from High School to college.  Most of the cast remains and Veronica is on the case again.  The sizzling romance with Logan is rekindled .  The college scene is somewhat believable, but I thought needed a little bit more work.  The last scene was a heartbreaker.",Positive
"I love this series. This is the third or fourth time through for me. The characters of John Shepherd, Tayla, Dr Weir, Ronan and Dr. Becket and Dr McKay are unforgettable. It is a wonderful space fantasy. Whenever I want to escape into another world I go to Stargate Atlantis. I imagine how cool it would be to travel to other worlds through a stargate/wormhole and meet other people who of course speak my language, English. The SG-1 series is good too and was the beginning of the Stargate series. In the beginning of Stargate Atlantis Jack O'Neil passes the torch to John Shepherd. Very cool indeed.",Positive
"This series is based on a Danish series, set in Seattle. The Killing is one crime being investigated in this series, a 17-year-old girl's murder. I am so used to there being a crime that is solved if not in each episode certainly by the end of a season. Each episode is a daily portrayal of the police investigation. It is great, it is engaging, it makes you care about what the police are doing and how they are doing it. It follows people connected to this little girl and makes you care about them and I truly want to find out what happens to all of them. I recommend it absolutely! I am starting on Season 2 and really looking forward to it.",Positive
"Good acting, bad scripts.  I kept wanting Kelly Riley to change into clothes that were appropriate for her job.  Wearing stiletto heels on a land dump crime scene made me seriously doubt her intelligence.",Negative
This is my favorite show. I love how complex the plot gets. I can't wait to see what happens next!,Positive
"This is a good show, just not really moving. It is a good who dunnit for anyone to watch. Nice show.",Negative
Wow the season with Ozzie.  Watching him swim and do so many of the challenges was fun.  Definitely one of the good seasons!,Positive
"I'm realy tired of so called cop shows that deal with 'alternate realities'. This one lost my interest in the first five minutes. I just don't care.Mistery and suspence should be based on real life. There is plenty there. Imaginary situations should be left to sci-fi and fantasy, not a suposed 'real world'.Thumbs down, all the way on this one!",Negative
really great show.  keeps you on the tips of your toes wanting more.  I love it and will continue watching.,Positive
"After 4 years, still love this series! Can't wait for the next season. The network also is also giving Claudia's character a more active role in the Warehouse the past 2 years, which I really liked. Would love to see more of H.G. Wells, too!",Positive
THIS IS A SHOW THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! I JUST WISH THAT PRIME MEMBERS DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR NEXT SEASONS!! HINTS THE WORD PRIME.....,Positive
I love Team Umizoomi as much as my 3 year old. We have watched season 1 over and over again and the other seasons you have to pay for. Well they finally gave us a break and made Team Umizoomi Season 2 available for Prime to view for free. We are definitely enjoying continuing to see what the team has been up to.,Positive
For a pilot this was great.  I need to see more of it to decide if i will really like the series or not but I suspect the show will make it through it's first season.It is entertaining and interesting definitely worth a watch and a look at the second episode.,Negative
Although had an amazing start at first I thought it would be more of a survival post apocalyptic show rather than sci-fi.,Positive
"STEVEN SPIELBERG HIT the television world with a bang two seasons ago, producing ""Terra Nova,"" ""Smash,"" ""The River"" and ""Falling Skies."" It was a shock when three of the four diverse shows were eventually cancelled. I mean, c'mon - this is Spielberg.But audiences loved TNT's science fiction gem ""Falling Skies"" about evil aliens invading and conquering Earth, and the interracial band of men and women who used guerrilla warfare and lots of heart to fight back.""Falling Skies: Season One"" took us directly into the conflict months after the invasion. We only see the aliens from the human's viewpoint and those bad boys mean business. Cities have been destroyed, the population decimated and children have been captured and used as slave labor, rigged up with symbiotic harnesses that link them directly to the enemy. A hardy band of rebels - consisting of Capt. Dan Weaver (Will Patton), history professor Tom Mason (Noah Wylie in his best work since ""E.R."") and his sons (Maxim Knight, Connor Jessup and Drew Roy), Doctor Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) and biker renegade John Pope (Colin Cunningham) - link up, sometimes willingly, sometimes not, to take back the world.Will Wheaton hosts ""2nd Watch: Episode 20 `A More Perfect Union,'"" where a cast roundtable explores the struggles faced in Season Two. It's one of the lively features on the set. Wheaton tells us that John Rogers, co-creator of TNT's ""Leverage,"" said, ""They wrote themselves into such a corner at the end of the first season, and this entire season has just paid this off so well.""Season Two ""had to be bigger, badder, had to move faster - Had to be cooler,"" executive producer Remi Aubuchon says in the feature, ""One Page at a Time: Writing the 2nd American Revolution.""Even with all that enthusiasm Aubuchon was shocked to find no one had any plans to move past Tom walking into the alien spacecraft.Writers and producers finally asked the big question: What's the most interesting way to bring Tom back? We discover Tom has been held for months and tortured by the aliens. When he's allowed to escape and gets back to the rebel unit - the 2nd Massachusetts, named after the 1777 regiment of the Continental Army - Tom tells Capt. Weaver he can't trust himself. Have the aliens done something to him that would cause him to betray his people?That's one of the mysteries of Season Two. We also find out how Tom's sons and the rest of the 2nd Mass survived without him, where they are now, and where they hope to go. These 10 episodes uncover more answers and open more mysteries - a challenging opening to Season Three.The high-def visuals and immersive sound give Season Two the look of quality film. Extras provide a wealth of information. Short featurettes include ""Terry O'Quinn is Manchester,"" ""Team Skitter,"" and ""The Fans' Perspective: Touring the Set of `Falling Skies.'"" In ""Designing the Spaceship,"" co-executive producer/director Greg Beeman says Spielberg was ""very involved."" ""They [the aliens] grow their computer system biologically. It's kind of a big nervous system,"" he tells us. Aubuchon credits Spielberg for ""Creating the Crawlies,"" another alien baddie, in that featurette. Apparently, when the studio questioned a design or effect, techs learned to say, ""Well, that's the way Stephen wants it."" Enough said.Commentary on premier episode ""Worlds Apart"" with Wylie, Beeman and writer Mark Verheiden; ""Molon Labe,"" with Wyle, Aubuchon and writers Bradley Thompson and David Weddle; and season finale ""A More Perfect Union"" with Wylie, Aubuchon, and writers Thompson and Weddle are informative and good listening.Still, the best thing is the story - the battle of good versus evil.""Things can only get worse, Tom, and none of us wants that to happen,"" alien puppet Karen Nadler (Jessy Schram) warns our Colonial-inspired fighters.Ha - bring it on, baby. We are ready for you!-- Kay Reynolds",Positive
"The UNcensored NC-17 version of Universal Soldier - Day of Reckoning is an above average sci-fi/action movie, nowhere near as good as its predecessor Regeneration, though. However despite the director's promise that the uncensored version will be released for home media this is not the case here. I don't buy INCOMPLETE movies, so I'm not buying Day of Reckoning until they correct this mistake!By the way, don't expect to see too much of Jean-Claude Van Damme or Dolph Lundgren in this one! They're only in it for a few minutes.",Negative
"This is a slow, but interesting story......I do like the characters and the story line.......just wish there was a bit more &#34;jazz&#34; to keep me interested.....the costumes,characters are great !",Positive
"It is not too bad till they get to the Titty Twister then it goes downhill a little. Salma Hayek much hotter then the new actress. I would say not to pay for this to watch it. Its the exact definition of average and ok show. I compare it to Revolution the second season with Revolution taking the nod as a little better but definitely heading downhill from the First season. Hope this helps, Walking Dead is a 5 star to give you a comparison",Negative
"Very down to earth, people as they really are.  No Hollywood hype tough guy, just great acting by great British actors.",Positive
"This is the best show on TV.  The writers tie so many different events together.  It's a smart show filled with action, suspense, and comic relief.  Season 4 will keep you hanging on for more.",Positive
I love shows that start with some disaster and you don't know what it is. This pilot got really creepy at the end and I can't wait to see where this is going.,Positive
"Love ABC's Lost? Try this! Just a great show all around, more focused on the characters than the zombies. But don't worry: there are plenty of jumps and blood as well!",Positive
Been following them since Season 1.  Once in a while I go back and watch that first espisode.  It was sooo good.,Positive
The whole series was great. It showed how military teams work together and have each others back.  It also showed how the wives help and support  each other. I would recommend this series to anyone.,Positive
"After a short Season Two due to the writer's strike, Season Three comes back with a vengeance.  Back are all the twists and turns of the story, and all the characters that made the show so interesting to begin with.  Good and bad seem to switch sides, and there are lots of unpredictable turns of events.  Season Three proved to be a wild ride.  On to Season Four.",Positive
I actually just started watching the mentalist a few months ago. I started at season 1 and was able to catch up to season 6 before it got to the finale. I absolutely fell in love with the show and storyline. Simon Baker is an outstanding actor and is very entertaining to watch. Season 6 is the best season by far. Can't wait for Season 7.,Positive
"Couldn't get into it, it's not the kind of humor I like. It's a little depressing too, I think. I'll pass on this series.",Negative
Season 3 is the best of The Walking Dead to date.  The first episode is nothing but action that grabs you by the throat and never lets go.  Highly recommended.,Positive
World war 2 is one of my favorite time periods and this takes place in England during the war. I wish there were more seasons to watch unfortunately this was the last season only bad thing about British TV the series end,Positive
I enjoy the complexity of the characters and stories. I like the quirkiness but something about it bothers me and I can't put my finger on what it is.,Positive
"Another outstanding season so far.  Can't wait to see where we go from here.  I like seeing seeing gemma with someone else,  especially someone like Jimmy Smit,  now lets get some revenge for Ope.",Positive
"My 4 and 5 year old love this series, but then again, they also love the movies. These shorter stories are very similar to the movies and perfect for a half an hour, which is more appropriate than many of the movies.",Positive
"DCI Tennison gains her staff's acceptance but all is not as conciliatory with the murder investigation of a black corpse found in a black neighborhood. London's citizens and police force have some race issues. Then there's Jane's hot new ""sleep-with.""""PRIME SUSPECT"" is also available, boxed as ""The COMPLETE COLLECTION"". A bargain compared to individual segments. If you are just finding Prime Suspect, you WILL want all 7 years. Not just tales of cops and murder, but in-your-fact realistic cop activity, which was done with so much realistic detail, it was the show to change British (and world) crime shows forever. It is the gritty type of show that all mystery film and TV now try to duplicate. Police drama was changed forever by Helen Mirren and her role as Jane Tennison.Be aware, the cases may not always end to your satisfaction--just like real life crimes and punishment. But you will be on the edge of your seat while you watch. Compelling viewing, ruthless in the detail, definitely not for children and the squeamish, blatantly course visually and in dialogue, but oh, so realistic. This show has won 7 Emmys and always includes guest stars aplenty.Helen Mirren makes the show as Tennison. Obsessed, work-driven, feminist attitude, course, in-your-face drive, compellingly believable, more man-like rather than the occasional romantic which does exist, she's a drinker, and she almost never smiles.Subtitles for this series.Tennison not only colors outside the box, she makes the box.",Positive
A worthy addition the the series!,Positive
"Strange Comedy. At first I did't like it at all. Due to John Goodman's acting skill, I began to enjoy it. Hope that season 2 will continue to improve.",Positive

"My husband and I were able to catch up with the first two seasons of Scandal with our Netflix subscription but wanted to catch up with this season to the point that our cable provider had the most recent episodes &#34;on demand&#34;. This helped us to &#34;bridge the gap&#34; in our binge watching of this series..  I would prefer not to have to pay an extra $1 for HD, but that is a minor consideration.There is a lot of buzz in the media about this season and we didn't want to miss out or accidently run into a spoiler for this series. This really helped.",Positive
"This show seems to be puttering out. Performance are getting stale and so are the characters.Barney was one of my favorites, now I feel like I can quote his lines before he says them.And Ted. Oh man, please, somebody shoot that character. So annoying. The worst kind of character. One that Says NO to everything and is a roadblock in moving the story forward.But, I still watch the damn thing. Cause they got me hooked.So, it's okay.",Negative
The series appears to end before much of anything is explained. It has its appeal. I figure it could have been better.,Negative
"my first impression in the beginning was nothing special, but it gets better as it goes along. I don't think I saw anything too original but I think it has potential to be a good entertaining show. When it reach the end, I found myself wanting to know what's going to happen next with these people. If it were released as 1 whole season at once, I think at the end of the pilot I will hit next episode.",Positive
"amazing show and if youre not watching it, you better start, it will be life changing, and you wont regret it",Positive

I started watching White Collar late in the game and went backwards to catch up on all the episodes from the first 2 seasons. I really love Matt Bomer in this role. I love the relationship between Peter and Neal and the newest suspicious addition to the White Collar family this season.,Positive
My Grandson very much enjoys this cute show. It is a nice clean show that seem very well done for young kids.,Positive

"This is what happens when a comedian burns out. Dunham's entire thing is his puppets, with which he insults his audience and gets away with it.  On a personal comedy-club level, this is acceptable. Once commercialized with music and fake laugh tracks, this show went to hell. In Dunham's case, since his entire show is based upon puppets, to come up with new material, you have to come up with new puppets. The scenarios that he has come up with...visiting real people and businesses and warping out obnoxiousness for humor's sake...is NOT funny. Let's not forget Dunham is JNew W*rld Ord*r and his denigration of and overt racism for the White Christian and Muslim races is nothing short of criminal! You see what his race of people REALLY thinks about other races on the planet! His stuff is NOT funny and he's reached the end of his rope...perhaps he'll hang himself with it!",Negative
"This show has all the elements of a first rate drama/action/adventure: romance, action, mystery, and a continually developing and twisting story.",Positive
"If this show continues, it will be in the same vein as Smash And Nashville. Loved McDowell as the conductor. He will bring a lot to the series should it continue",Positive
"This show needs to do something. The season finale involved a guy digging in the mud and coming up with nothing. Not a guy with a back hoe excavating a secret tunnel entrance but a scuba diver lifting much for a few minutes. I want to know about the mystery of Oak Island as well. Not the history, Wikipedia has that covered but what's under the ground. If this show is going to make it, season 2 is going to have to involve some actual searching of the island instead of meeting with elderly people who have crazy ideas about it.",Negative
"This show is truly great, not only for those familiar graphic novels or comics, but for those who enjoy watching great drama and a charismatic hero.  There is a back story so we can understand the dramatic change he endured to become such a different person.  At the series has developed, he is joined by others in on his secret life and mission.  Fantastic and truly worth watching.",Positive
This show takes the Fairy Tale to a whole other level!  This season was even better; great special effects; highly recommend! Never boring!,Positive
Good action and funny situations.It had action.Like a sexy Get Smart. Some real life situations. More real life that get smart.At times thought I was watching a tv show on CBS.,Positive
"Love this show.  I like stephen king stories, so I knew this would be great.  It is a good mix of sci fi, drama, action, and mystery.  The cast is ok, and a few of them shine.  Can't wait for season 2.",Positive
"This one is more for just the ladies. The morals and dignity of these ladies is wonderful, feeling stressed or blue? watch an episode, it makes you fall in love with the simple life",Positive
A good follow up to the first season. The cliffhanger from season one is answered. You meet a lot of interesting players in this season and the main vilian is no joke. A must buy series if you are into good action and a well told story.,Positive
"I don't usually hate things, but I cannot stand that I spent my candy money on one episode of this show! Lame",Negative
"A little more drama, a little less Pow-Pow!, but this was well placed. I am emotionally invested enough in the characters to care about them at this point, and this episode introduced some major plot twists/advances. I had been thinking the series was a bit corney but this one showed me that it was indeed working well.  :)",Positive
"This season of SP isn't as solid as many of the others.  There are a few episodes I think are a little weak like ""Medicinal Fried Chicken,"" ""Poor and Stupid,"" ""Insheeption,"" and ""Creme Fraiche.""  But what the season may lack in consistency, it makes up for in WOW moments.  I don't think I've ever been as blown away watching an animated show than I was seeing the uncovering of the truth of Cartman's father on ""201.""  ""Mysterion Rises"" also gave me a ""Of course!  It's so obvious!"" moment.  This season also offers quite a few old school Looney Tunes cartoon references that brought back childhood memories.  Season 14 was good though not as consistently brilliant as past seasons.  I am reducing the score an extra star because of the egregious censoring of ""201""--one of the most exciting SP episodes ever.  What could Kyle and the others at the end possibly be saying to warrant the entire thing being bleeped out?  And the bleeping of every mention of Mohammad is very annoying and is a bit baffling considering his name was not bleeped at all in ""200.""  Why not bleep it on this DVD if it is so dangerous?  Still, I guess we are lucky that this episode is included at all since it is not available online and hasn't been aired on Comedy Central since.Disc 1:""Sexual Healing""--So clever.  Saying what a lot of people think went down in the Tiger Woods's household, but doing it in X-Box EA Sports form and then bringing in the sex addiction theme with Ben Roethlisberger, Bill Clinton, Charlie Sheen, etc, is just brilliant.""The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs""--The boys are disappointed by a supposed controversial book assigned in school (the one that ""made a guy shoot the king of hippies"" according to Cartman), so they write their own.  Afraid of getting in trouble, they credit the book to Butters who is elevated to genius for his masterpiece in sociopolitical commentary and uncontrolled vomiting.  It's funny how readers interpret the disgusting passages.  Gross.""Medicinal Fried Chicken""--KFCs are being replaced by medicinal cannabis stores.  Randy and his friends purposely get testicular cancer so they can partake.  This episode is overly silly with the men bouncing on their balls like hippity hops.  Meanwhile, Cartman resorts to the black market to get his KFC fix.""You Have 0 Friends""--Despite his resistance, Stan's friends sign him up with a Face Book account and he is deluged with demands from ""friends"".  Stan finds that deleting a FB profile is tougher than he thought.  Meanwhile, the always sympathetic Kyle befriends a lonely boy who has no friends and finds that his own FB stock falls as a result thanks to Eric ""Kramer"" Cartman.""200""--This episode and the sequel blew me away back when they first aired.  In this part, Tom Cruise and all the celebrities defamed in South Park get together and demand to see Mohammad, who is the only person they know susceptible to ridicule, so they can get his goo.  They then get competition from gingers.  In another storyline, Jennifer Lopez (a.k.a. Mitch Conner) gets Mr. Hat to admit to Cartman that there was a cover-up pertaining to the identity of his father.  A LOT of past characters show up in these episodes which is a real treat for long-time SP fans.Disc 2:""201""--The continuation of ""200"".  I will not give away the ending, but it blew me away when I saw it when it first aired.  I said, ""No Way!"" out loud even though I was watching it by myself.  Brilliant!  Controversy surrounds the ""I learned something today"" speeches at the end as Comedy Central decided to bleep them out.  They are still bleeped out on this DVD.  I thought it was done on purpose when I first saw it, but Trey Parker and Matt Stone were actually angry it was done that way and a text statement from them is included at the beginning of this episode.""Crippled Summer""--A hilarious take-off of the ""Intervention"" TV series featuring Towlie"" ""I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!...Oh, it IS Wednesday.""  Also, a Looney Tunes treatment is given to a camp for handicapped kids where Nathan (the steroid seller in ""Up the Down Steroid"") keeps trying to get revenge on popular Jimmy, but his plans keep backfiring on him thanks to a dopey sidekick.""Poor And Stupid""--Cartman thinks he can't fulfill his dream of being a great NASCAR driver because he is not poor and stupid.  He thus gives away all his money and eats Vagisil to impede his short-term memory.""It's A Jersey Thing""--South Park (as well as the eastern half of the country) is being invaded by New Jerseyites.  It gets so bad, they contact al-Qaeda for help.  In this episode, viewers find out Sheila Broflovski is from Jersey (big surprise, huh?) and her son Kyle was conceived there, meaning he is struck by the three J's, according to Cartman, Jerseyite, Jewish, Jinger.  Fans of ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" and ""Jersey Shore"" will appreciate this episode.""Insheeption""--This is a take-off on the TV series ""Hoarders"".  Those shows are often funny anyway in a pathetic way, but I don't think SP took advantage of the possibilities.  A sheep herder?  And the hoarding theme is replaced by the dream/memory sequence.  This episode is also taken from the film ""Inception"" (hence the title) and the College Humor parody of ""Inception"" (so much so, it lead to an apology from Parker and Stone).  Stan's mom sums up this episode very well: ""Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool."" On a side note, that bully who torments a young Mr. Mackey looks like the kid in ""Eight Is Enough.""Disc 3:""Coon 2: Hindsight""--The Coon and his super hero friends keep getting overshadowed by Captain Hindsight, ""the hero of the modern age,"" who only tells people what should have been done to prevent disasters after they've happened. When he becomes the hero of the Gulf oil spill, Cartman tries to recruit him by resorting to blackmail.  Meanwhile, BP's continuous drilling causes increasing horrors for the environment and humanity.  The other members of Coon and Friends are fed up with Cartman's violent, overbearing tactics and kick him out of the union.""Mysterion Rises""--In this episode, we find out the identity of Mysterion (if it wasn't known before) and his real power.  When I saw this part I was blown away, ""Of course!  It all makes sense now!""  Cartman joins forces with the evil Cthulhu to get back at his former ""friends.""  Mysterion tries to see if there is a connection between the Cult of Cthulhu and his power.  I like the parody of the Lebron James commercial.  The Cthulhu song is hilarious.""Coon Vs. Coon & Friends""--In this final installment of the three-parter, Cartman and Cthulhu banish Cartman's former friends to the Nightmare City of R'lyeh while they wreak havoc to make the world a better place...for Cartman.  Mysterion takes action to stop them but an unsuspected hero may be the one to save the day.  I like Cartman's comic book summary of the story where he pleads with his ""evil"" friends (he thinks he's the good guy, of course) to ""Go with Christ."" Cartman also does a parody of that cartoon where the little kitten kneads and curls up on the back of the bulldog.  I remember that cartoon from my kid days.""Creme Fraiche""--Randy becomes obsessed with cooking shows in a sexual way while his wife Sharon gets out her frustrations using the shake weight.  This episode is hardly believable--I mean cab fare wouldn't be a few coins LOL.",Negative
The action continues where season 1 left off. Has all the action of season 1 and I love it. The plot thickens.,Positive
"My wife and I get tired of subtitlesyou can get so busy reading them that you miss too much of a movieif they're going to sell their movies over here in the U.S.A.then the least they can do is get it dubbed well in EnglishI've passed on at least 30 movies that look good simply because of the subtitleswhich should still be included on the DVD, but be limited to it because once you watched one with English then you might want to watch it again later with the subtitles to pick up on more nuancesFor those who say take it or leave it, stop and consider how much much was spent making this movie. These days, a lot of international films that include English dubbing do an excellent job with the dubbing. The subtitles many times leave out a LOT of the dialogue. Imo, the subtitles lessened the experience of the movie.The cost for QUALITY dubbing compared to the overall cost of the movie is insignificant.The avoided expense of quality dubbing in other languages especially English for US sales as we spend more on DVDs than any other country in the world, IS a reason to affect the rating of the movie. Other foreign films do it and do it quite well.Compared to what was spent on the rest of the movie making it, quality dubbing in English would only to the movie which is not just a rich visual experience but has more to it in the dialogue than you get with subtitles.For those who say stop and pause to read them....that's no way to experience a movie either. I want to relax and enjoy it as I bought it to watch in my own home.When you buy any product made in say Japan or China, the vendors take the time to include an English version in their printed instruction manuals. I'm saying the company selling this on DVD would sell more of them if they did the extra work.All they've done is digitize the movie and copy it onto a DVD with subtitles. Considering the price of this movie, they took the cheap route.I'm not just rating the movie but the product which is on DVD and is what I bought. It would have been a great value had it also had quality dubbing in English.Those who love the movie as is seem to have forgotten the fact they're actually buying more than just the screenplay, but the rest of the product as well.I add nothing here about the movie itself since others have already covered that.",Positive
"""Devious Maids"" Season 1 pilot episode features scenes that help to tell a mini-story on each maid that helps the viewer understand each of the women better. There was strong acting to start off the series and I like the feature of the maids getting together to talk to each other. However, my only caveat to the story is that this episode left me feeling the most sympathy for mainly the Marisol Duarte character. Please understand that I am aware that the writer is probably only trying to come from generous intent when capturing characters who work for wealthy bosses and need days off like everyone else (including creating adequate cheerful plots to go along with the show's message). However, the series could be made stronger if it shows the woman truly thankful for their jobs, but just needing extra time off for legitimate circumstances that cannot just be rescheduled (such as graduations, acting and/or song rehearsals, court dates, funerals,surgeries,  concerts as presents, vacations as gifts such as honeymoon packages, school field trips etc.). Aside from that caveat, the ending of the Devious Maids pilot episode draws a viewer in to watch the second episode of ""Setting The  Table.""""Devious Maids"" Season 1 Episode 2 of ""Setting The Table"" starts out strong as the women continue on with their lives working for their employers.  My only caveat with this episode is the portrayal of Judy Reyes as Zoila Diaz. I feel that Reyes gives a persuasive and superb portrayal, but I also feel as if she is being forced to portray an overprotective and overbearing mother. Yes, it is clear that Zoila wants the best for her daughter Valentina and may be trying to protect her from personal experience. When I mean experience, I am talking more about maybe there was a romantic relationship that broke Zoila's heart and she is only trying to shield her daughter from going through a similar experience. However, it would help if further reasons are mentioned on why the Zoila character is acting this way. I also enjoy the bumbling and lighthearted character of Genevieve Delatour  (impressively portrayed by Susan Lucci).Aside from that caveat, ""Devious Maids"" Season 1 Episode 2 ""Setting The Table"" is amusing to watch.",Positive
"Hello,  This is a good show.  I can watch it with my son and do not have to worry about language.  It is fun to watch and some of the characters are real good.  The druid is by far my favorite.  Thanks.",Positive
"Love it!  Some good lookin' men, all be it dirty....  Compelling and interesting.  Some historical accuracies and some good fiction fun.",Positive
Is it the most intense?  No.  Is it the funniest? No.The appealing thing about this show is the character development.  Over the course of the seasons you really feel like you get to know the characters.,Positive
"Entertaining from first to last.  The characters are clearly defined and captivating.  This is something I will make it a point to own.  If you like period stories and movies, this is well worth your time.",Positive
Fantastic and thought provoking.  Can we make it a requirement for the US Congress to watch and write a summary of the message it is communicating?,Positive
Loved the first four seasons cant stand season five. The actors seemed burned out on their roles. Not gonna watch more.,Negative
"I didn't know what to expect with this remake, but I was totally impressed with the feel of it.  The casting was perfect!  The story was ""classic trek"" which should make any fan of the original television series more than pleased.  There were a few odd additions  (like the quirky relationship between Uhura and Spock, the fate of Spock's mother, and the ultimate demise of the Romulan villain) that didn't gel with what I remembered from the original, but hopefully if this remake kick-starts a new resurgence of sequels, these odd additions may evolve and/or be explained in later movies.Overall, this is an awesome remake amidst a dismal gallery of very bad ones in a variety of genres.  They got it so right... thank goodness!  Enjoy and of course, Live Long and Prosper!",Positive
"No new ground here, but it is worth watching. Nice location shots, decent action and some good looking characters. Stories are okay to good.",Negative
Very good series.  Not your typical cop show.  You get connected to all the characters and their lives. I plan on watching all the seasons.,Positive
"I liked the premise at the beginning of following the raccoons given collars, but then the focus shifted to other cities.  By the time it shifted back to the Toronto study there was not enough time to get much information.  I think it would have been more interesting to focus on the original study with perhaps just a few remarks about the Japanese and German ones.",Negative
"If you loved Archer Season 1 and S2, then you'll love S3.  But I still wanted more and got just that when I checked out the extras or bonus section.  I enjoyed it.I decided to view the DVD again but this time with the subtitles.  I had no idea how much dialogue I was missing..If you're going to rewatch, try the subtitles.",Positive

"Another of the History Channel's increasing roster of infotainment programs, ""America's Book of Secrets"" is one that is decidedly hit or miss.  Playing up speculation, myth, and even scandal, the show aims to be somewhat provocative but, more often the not, comes across as a bit silly.  I mean, really, there is an episode about the Playboy Mansion!  I certainly don't have anything against Hef and the girls, but the episode seems ill-fitting at best and completely overblown at worst.  And for a show that promises secrets, many of the episodes offer very little new material (especially if you have a pre-existing interest in and knowledge of the topic).  Instead of straightforward profiles, in most cases the show attempts to sensationalize its subjects.  So we've got myth and speculation, conspiracy theories, and factual specifics all wrapped up in a docuseries that is overflowing with self importance.  If you watch History Channel offerings with frequency, you'll know what I mean.  Even the most mundane declarations are stated in such an overheated way!  It can be off-putting to new viewers, but it's something that has provided much amusement in my life.I'm not trying to discourage anyone from sampling ""America's Book of Secrets"" as it might appeal to those that love the National Treasure films or Dan Brown books or Brad Meltzer's Decoded.  I'm just trying to set appropriate expectations for new viewers of History fare.  The program is fun enough, but it works much better as entertainment (to my mind) than as a source of real information.DVD Specifics:  The set features the ten episodes of Season One plus the Bonus Special that launched the entire enterprise (let's just call it eleven episodes for the sake of ease) spread over 3 discs.  Each show clocks in at around 47 minutes so you're getting roughly 8.5 hours of material including the added bonus show.  The DVD has English and Spanish subtitle options.Episodes:(1) The White House, (2) Free Masons, (3) Fort Knox, (4) Area 51, (5) The Playboy Mansion, (6) Presidential Transports, (7) The FBI, (8) West Point, (9) Black Ops, and (10) The Pentagon.Bonus Episode: The MonumentsIf you are completely unfamiliar with the History series format, I might suggest sampling an episode (they repeat with frequency) before making the full investment.  My guess, this will either really appeal to you or it will really not.  While I enjoyed some of the episodes more than others, the series never really qualified as must-see destination television for me.  KGHarris, 9/12.",Negative
"My curiosity is what made me get this. I was worried that they couldn't bring this together conceptually. This show is set in the now, but  the original movie was set in the 50's?  But once you start watching the character's and plot are so interesting that I didn't find myself caring so much. The first few minutes gets your attention and you just want to know more and more. The tone of the show is a bit spooky. The mom is a real piece of work, and Norman is a likeable, sweet boy. You can totally put together why he ends up the guy from Psycho. There is a lot going on in this show to get and keep you hooked. Not to spoil anything but the first few episodes has a possible murder and cover-up, a rape, a definite murder and cover-up, a sex trade hostage, a bulldog sheriff, a dangerous deputy, and an illegal drug operation that the whole town might be a part of. Yep, it's a roller-coaster.  If you like shows like Smallville and Supernatural (I do) then I think you will like this.",Positive
Wish it was back.  Don't know why they always cancel the good shows. Get rid of all those reality shows and bring back real tv.Awesome show!,Positive
"Curious George is a family-friendly show with great tools for any budding scientist, analyst, or news journalist. What do I mean?Each episode, for example, focuses on George going through a scientific-method-like process to figure out solutions to everyday problems. George's inquisitive nature helps him form hypotheses and experiment to test each hypothesis.George lives with a man with a yellow hat (that's his brand). His character's ok, but GEORGE steals the show. Kids will love the bright colors and uptempo pace of the show. The show has a narrator (who sounds a lot like the man in the yellow hat) who helps guide the viewer through George's actions and thoughts.You can't go wrong with this show.",Positive
"I love cooking shows. Chopped is interesting and entertaining. If you are competitive you will like this show. if you're they type that likes to quickly get to the bottom of things and cook fancy things, you will like this show. With only 4 contestants you don't get to know their hearts because the show is fast paced, so they aren't on it for very long. Still you'll find yourself cheering the contestants on and feeling their ups and downs. I only gave it three stars because the judges do not make me fall in love with the show and the show's fast pace isn't my style.  For me, something is missing.  It is not as exciting nor educational as The Next Master Chef or Hell's Kitchen, but it still may motivate you to be more daring when you cook.",Negative
"This is an excellent series by any production standard BUT I can understand why they cancelled it after the first season. Not many stuck with it due to its complex story line and what seems to be ""oddball acting"" by an eccentric cast. The most vivacious role and best acting was by his inadvertent (and gorgeous) neighbor. Rubicon requires watching carefully and hanging in there to piece it together just like the characters in are doing as their job assignments unfold, but there is no wham-BAM, snap, crackle, and PoP. One suspenseful interval but the rest rather bland and dull cerebral ""ah-ha's"" which are gratifying to a minority of viewers. Even the office politics are predictable and transparent. ""Three Days of the Condor"" was the ultimate conspiracy story as it had pulse and urgency and suspense, and excitement to it. Rubicon is a poignant illumination of pure greed for corporate power and wealth with the the US Government as their lackey. If you like patiently sorting out the chaos to attain clarity then this is highly recommended. After the last episode it is definitely too bad this will not be continued, but it left us all just where it was supposed to - understanding the true significance of the 4 leaf clover, wondering about the fates of Miles (and Julia), Ingram, Will, and Maggie as well as knowing the fate of Spangler, for without him there is no crossword puzzle and lamenting for David, Tom, and Katherine. Stick with it, its worth it!",Positive
"I liked the look of this one while it had it's run, wish it had lasted longer. The &#34;look&#34; of the series was always very good and the writing seemed pretty good too. Similar to Joss Whedons' &#34;Dollhouse&#34; in that the character &#34;Edward&#34; has a dual identity as &#34;Henry&#34; imprinted in his mind, activated when he's off duty. I was never really sure who, or what Edward worked for- some shadowy Government, or private, agency?- but the stories were interesting and always had a good look to them.Christian Slater did a good job portraying dual roles as Edward and Henry, I'd have loved to see how that one would've worked out. Judging by my memory, and the air dates Amazon lists, NBC didn't give the series a lot of respect- they certainly cancelled it quickly. Probably had too big a budget and wasn't an instant ratings success.I've rewatched episodes 1-6 & 9, all good. The first 6 at least have a young Taylor Lautner in them (the packaging makes a point of emphasizing &#34;Twilight&#34;) he's good but miscast as he doesn't look anything like the rest of his &#34;family&#34;.Even if you don't like My own worst enemy it's still better than most of the trash out there.",Positive
"THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SHOWS THAT TOOK A WHILE FOR ME TO GET INTO. ONCE I DID, HOWEVER, I GREW TO APPRECIATE THE CHARACTERS AND THE ACTORS WHO PLAY THEM. I LIKE THE CONCEPT.

"I'm on the fence on whether or not I'll get another season. But I liked it enough to where I will keep it.  (If I don't like a DVD I purchased, I send it on to friends who might.)  I would actually rate it 3 1/2.  A little violent, but not quite as bad as other shows I've seen.",Negative
"I really thought this was going to be something totally different.  Charlie Sheen plays a misbehaving artist who no longer has the creative juice to do anything new.  It turns into very standard rehash about losing a girlfriend, brushes with the law, and testing the patience of old friends and relatives.  I suppose these actors did the best they could with what few ideas were in the script.  The last scene was pretentious beyond belief.",Negative
"The show isn't bad, but it isn't great either. The concept and experience is really interesting of the show, however the use of foul language repeatedly can be excessive and not fun for a family setting.",Positive

"Perfection, NV: A tiny western town of dust, sand... and giant carnivorous graboids burrowing underground.And after three movies of battling the graboids, shriekers and ass-blasters, fans of the ""Tremors"" series finally got a (tragically short-lived) TV spinoff. ""Tremors: The Complete Series"" takes everything fun about the movies tacks in some conspiracies and freaky mutants -- there are a few mildly grating characters, but it's still deliciously fun and strange.A new guy named Tyler Reed (Victor Browne) rolls into Perfection, intending to take over the Desert Jack Graboid Tours... just in time for El Blanco to go on a berserk feeding frenzy.It isn't the last graboid-related problem -- Burt Gummer (Michael Gross) and the other Perfectionites must deal with a gourmet assblaster, a scientist training shriekers to be rescue animals, a graboid attacking a town of UFO-fanatics, graboid-rights activists who claim the Perfectionites are killing El Blanco, and a pair of mob thugs who run afoul of El Blanco and lost a very important key.And pretty soon there are even worse problems. Burt finds that a strange substance called MixMaster, leaked out of a secret laboratory, begins to infect the valley and turns the creatures into bizarre hybrids -- giant shrimps, omnivorous termite/maggots, a mineshaft ""ghost,"" or an acid-spitting reptilian plant.""Tremors: The Complete Series"" was cancelled after only thirteen episodes, but those episodes are brilliant from beginning to end. And they have everything you'd expect from a Tremors series -- lots of big guns, explosions, orange goop, and highly imaginative ways to kill various monsters (including with weather balloons and tar).For the record: the MixMaster, the secret lab and the eccentric old scientist all seem rather hokey, but soon they mesh nicely into the existing ""Tremors"" mythology. Think a funnier, lighter ""X-Files"" vibe. And the writers do an excellent job, weaving clever plots with plenty of action, a bit of tragedy (Cletus and Project 4-12), and lots of hilarious dry humor, especially regarding Burt (""Somebody get up on the wrong side of the bunker today?"").Gross is, as always, brilliant as the endearing survivalist Burt -- he has to start a survival school, wrangle with a hard-headed government rep, and deal with a town of hostile UFO-fanatics. Browne is decent as the new ""everyman lead,"" and there are some solid supporting performances by Lela Lee, Marcia Strassman, Sarah Rafferty, and especially Christopher Lloyd as a wonderfully eccentric scientist-turned-desert-hermit.Two of the cast aren't quite as endearing -- J.D. Walsh's pushy ubernerd just ends up being annoying. And Gladys Jimenez's Rosalita is a fun character (an ex-showgirl with a shady history) but sometimes it feels like she's there to run around in filmy shirts.""Tremors: The Complete Series"" has a couple bumps in the road, but overall it's a brilliant spinoff to the classic B-movie series. A must-see... or if you're a graboid, a must-eat.",Positive

I think this season was better than past seasons and really setup the Jax as just another heartless leader and Gemma's ruthlessness continues. This season I thought was the darkest so far but definitely better than the last season and the Irish episodes or season 2.,Positive
"At the base of the story is a group of teenagers oblivious to an obviously evil presence that demands their cooperation.  To get into that  is getting more difficult for me.  A sharp town sheriff is one moment sharp then repeatedly erratically gullible.  A smart man accused of murder is holding a gun on the murderer and doesn't mention to the sheriff who is present that the murderer fired the gun which can be proved with a paraffin test (used by police for at least 100 years).

It is sad to see some go,gratifying to see some grow and learn, always entertaining!",Positive
For all you red meat types who like your copycat CSI programs this is one has the most entertaining characters. Most of them are 100% dysfunctional but they dress to kill and again solve all their crimes with high tech lab junk and computers. Watch it while you eat to get the most from there defleshing corpses. Obviously they never smelled a three day old rotting body. Other than that it is fun.,Positive
"Interesting. An attempt to diagnose psychosis and its origins through mayhem and impulsive violence. Intense, twisted, disturbed. But, like so much of life, only one side of the story. I'd hate to live in a universe based on these types of movies. Everything would be very serious, very grave and your life would be in danger every minute, from sources both natural and unnatural. Life on the edge. What put it there?",Negative
"This is not a bad movie.  It's very watchable, decent amount of action spread throughout the movie, plot is kind of meh but serviceable.  Acting and pace was altogether good.Typical B action/drama where the bad guys are really bad and the good guys are not so good but altogether it works for the purposes of the story.  4.25 stars because of some pretty large plot holes and some glaring loose ends.",Positive
I found that it was a very depressing story with no real message or meaning. Hated it. Will not even try to watch any other movies by this director.,Negative
"This production has spared no expense on settings and costumes.  It is a visual feast.  However, beware that this show shows alot of skin/sex and is definitely not for children.  I have seen 3 seasons and felt they were all good.  While i don't like all the violence,  it does give me a feel for how brutal the times were and how easy it was to get your head chopped off.",Positive

"The pilot episode is funny because its audacious and over-the-top redneckery, but shortly thereafter it becomes a droll, uninteresting show about this stupid family of fakes pretending to be beverly hillbilly like backwoodsmen, new to fame and fortune because of a popular duck call, having fun in their hemi trucks and shiny new carharrrrrrt attire.  I would have a real problem with the publicly bigotted statements if it weren't simply a pandering to an audience of morbidly obese neckertown walmartians and a  false flag of 'any-publicity-even-negative-is-publicity-nonetheless' as a dubious means to perpetuate a WELL overplayed merchandising campaign at Walmart that is as stupid as the people who buy into it.",Negative
The 3 part series is very thorough and provides a lot of information that I believe is overlooked when reviewing this topic. The celebrity voice overs were great too.,Positive
The show has broad appeal to girls and boys; various ages and interest. I like the shows Imagination and modern approach to story telling.,Positive

"Don't be fooled by any good reviews....This is definitely the WORST piece of garbage I have ever seen...No explanation, no closure...Just one of those endings that not only gives ZERO explanation of WTF just happened!!!...Not even slight innuendo, I am truly shocked at just how bad this was",Negative
"As others have written here already, this show was plain terrible. The writing was terrible. Much of the story was nonsensical. For example, I found it unbelievable that this band of people who are trapped for 15-20 minutes in a parking garage would stick together for whatever devastating event happened. The acting wasn't great, but I feel sorry for the actors because they had a bad script from which to work. If the writing was better, the acting may have been better too.I also didn't care for some of the stereotypes that were used for the characters. The foul language was a bit excessive too.I am not going to watch the next episode if this pilot gets greenlit.",Negative

I am huge huge fan of all the best television from MadMen, Suits, Boardwalk, to even Phineas and Ferb I only watch good stuff.  No time to waste and Breaking Bad is the best of all time.  It's disturbing, but not sensual and dirty like Game of Thrones.  If I had one show it would be this one.  It's a must see all the way through start to finish. It's better than the Sopranos and I know that's a classic and it's hurts to say, but it's true!",Positive

"Yeah, I know it is a cartoon but still it conjures up he real thing when I watch it. i only watched part of the first episode. Had to stop since I did not enjoy the subject manner and also the style of the cartoon was not on par with my other favorites. Just was not interesting to me.",Negative
"My first impression of these backhills Tennessee feuding families wasn't terrible encouraged to watch these, but my husband liked them and now I'm on board.  Lotsa shootemups and car chases, but the characters are developing something like human characteristics",Positive
The series is terrific and the best part it is free.  Free-that is-until near the end of the season then we are asked to pay 1.99 per episode.

"I really always want to like this show. I wish Bravo could come up with someone who was really a GOOD matchmaker because the concept is soooo good. But this is the best of all of the ones I have seen, mostly because of the Pattimelts. She is so unpredictable, which is like watching a train jump the tracks. Even so, it is not enough. She hardly ever gets it right, and how could she with this &#34;line-up and act and dress like something you are not&#34; approach. It is all so surface. She coaches them on how to be what the millionaire wants. Not good. And it all happens so badly.Here is the right show. Take the Million Dollar Listing show and have several matchmakers trying to &#34;sell&#34; a client. See multiple dates (just like you see all these property showings).  It would be really really great!Of course, any time you have a long running show, you run a risk when the side kicks leave, and the two she had were really good. They just sort of helped round her out.",Negative

"Being a fan of all these ladies, I was expecting something along the lines of ""Bridesmaids"" with a hint of ""Mean Girls,"" both films I liked.  Unfortunately what I got was a mean spirited, unfunny story about 3 unpleasant and unlikeable women, all of whom are too attractive to be in such a state of despair.Regan (Kirsten Dunst) is the maid of honor for Becky (Rebel Wilson) who no one thought would ever get married.  Certainly not before Regan or her other two gal pals, Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher).  The trio has never outgrown their party days from high school.  In one scene, Gena gets on a plane stoned and gets into a conversation with a seat mate (Horatio Sanz credited as ""Barely Attractive"") about how she manages to give a man felacio on a scale of 4 to 10.  The film is full of raunchy dialog and the ladies lead the way.  This doesn't bother me but I checked out when Gena hooks up with a former boyfriend (Adam Scott).  After the wedding, Clyde (Scott) stands up and rather than toast the new couple, tells everyone how he bedded Gena and went ""in and out, in and out.""  Really?The middle section of the film is forgettable and hinges on the girls being able to repair the bride's dress that they tore apart while high on coke.  While all this sex talk might make you think, this is going to get better, it doesn't.  All the characters keep their clothes on.  In fact when the boys go out to a strip club the night before the wedding, they don't seem to be concerned at all that the strippers...well... keep their clothes on.  Huh?  Yeah, girls giving lap dances in their dresses.  Where are these places?  I want to be sure to keep my distance.",Negative
"I love the show Burn Notice. It is a show I have watched religiously  from the begining.Bruce Campbell takes his sidekick job on Burn Notice to front and center in this TV movie. His Sam Axe Character back story is a cute idea to explore his TV mythos, which has never been covered fully in the four seasons of the show. If you want to view this film, he is the only reason to watch this film.After playing the character for four years, Campbell is comfortable in Axe's skin. The film is fairly done for a TV film, but the script by Notice scribe Matt Nix seems a jumbled mess with too many laconic ideals.Jeffrey (Micheal Weston)  Donovan directs this film without many of the Notice trademarks and style shots, which makes you watch this show more and more. It almost seem like this film was  rushed in its scope to wet your whisle for season five of Notice. Again the direction of this film  is due to the disorganized  script whixh plots in directions that peter outCampbell is likeable as Axe, but he has been likeable  in all of Burn Notice episodes. He can hold your interest, but this film is the wrong vehicle for him. He as I said before is the only reason to watch this tripe.Bennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD",Negative

"In television the key to a long running series is the interplay of the characters on the screen more than the actual story line.  In the book series King and Maxwell play well off each other, can the TV writers continue that, that will be the key to the future of this TV shows.It doesn't matter that they butchered the story &#34;The Sixth man&#34; for the pilot show, it gave them some characters that they will need to make this a truly interesting series.  It also doesn't matter that the Series Sean King is only 6 ft, not 6 ft 3 like in the book.  And Ms. Maxwell is running around in high heals.  I don't know what it is about Hollywood that they think all women run around in stiletto and can run and jump and kick ass in them.  If you have the chance to view any woman in Michael line of work, the the last thing they wear is a stiletto.  Don't get me wrong, I love to see a woman in 6 in stilettos, I don't know how they walk, I just enjoy it.That being aside, the show is working hard to create that interplay between the two stars to make it work.  What makes the shows like NCIS, Law a& Order, Bones and all the great shows stand the test of time is that interplay.  Being a fan of Baldacci and his work, I would like to see it last, but not if it will denigrate his work.  I've watched 6 shows, and it shows promise.  Now if the writers can continue with quality scripts, but the most important thing, is the King & Maxwell relationship.",Positive
"my first thought with this show was, ""oh, we really need another fbi serial killer show, right?""  three episodes in, however, i must admit the show is doing some interesting things. first, this is about a cult of followers, wannabee serial killers under the villain's control.  The actor playing the villain is doing the very best acting job so far on the show.  It isn't easy playing charming, handsome and murderous.  But he does it.second, there are some creative set ups.  in this third episode there is a member of the cult who is playing edgar allan poe to an audience.  he is remarkably good at it and is in a mask.  he is setting up a murder. the mask itself was a work of art.POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOWthird, this show carves out some new territory that is really ""out there"" in gruesome.  we see the killer's small son, who has up till now been a normal boy, being taught to kill by the cult followers. the makers are taking a risk with this as this may be too much for some audience members, especially those who are parents. they are starting out small, with a mouse for the boy to kill, but still, this is new territory in serial killing shows.i will keep watching.  this last episode hooked me in for at least awhile. long range it is just too early to say. one reviewer asks what these followers are using for money and that is a good question which we need answered soon as to keep this somewhat believable.",Positive

"""I'm looking for someone, her name is Isabel. I've come to save her."" Joey (Statham) is a homeless ex special forces soldier on the run from a court martial. When he stumbles on a chance to change who he is he takes it. When someone he knows comes up missing he has to walk the line between who he was and who he wants to be. Since this is a Statham movie I had an expectation going in. I was expecting another Transporter type movie, since that is basically all he does. I am a fan of his but who's gonna argue that. The first half hour made it seem like a different movie for him, then he became a driver/hit-man and I thought...here we go again. For the most part though this was a different movie and role for him and he did a pretty good job. This is nothing amazing and won't really change the way he is viewed but for once this isn't just another Transporter type movie. I liked it, but again I am a Statham fan. Overall, a different type of movie for him and worth seeing. I give it a B.",Negative
"After seeing how the small screen mangles history (""The Tudors"" comes to mind), it's generally wise to avoid television's hysterical historical soap operas...but The Vikings is one big exception.Perhaps it is simply because I don't know enough about the Norsemen to point and scoff when they pull off an egregious screw up, so I can just sit back and watch the blood flow. And flow it does!  The battle scenes are soaked in the stuff...the Vikings are smeared, splashed, polkadotted and generally bedaubed with grue. Even the ocean sometimes runs red with it.  And these guys have some serious weapons.  No effete little daggers or delicate epees.  Hatchets, Axes, broadswords...if it's big and sharp, it's all good.This is the story of Ragnar Lothbrok, his family and his crew (crew being used both in the sense of The Sopranos and shipmates.) Ragnar is based on real character in Norse legend, a farmer with an urge to explore. And being a Viking, an even more compelling urge to thwack with his axe. And to commit a bit of plundering while he's at it. The word 'Viking' means raider, and for good reason. Ragnar is married to shieldmaiden Lagartha, that title being given to women who prefer thwacking to weaving and baking.  In Episode 1, we see her take on two burly attackers and make them sorry they weren't more polite; By Episode 3, we understand this is not a woman you'd want to confront at a Donald Pliner sample sale. Let her have the strappy sandals. Just walk away.In the series, which is set somewhere around the year 800, the Vikings are unaware of any lands to their West (which sounds dodgy to me). They have heard of England but don't necessarily believe it exists outside of legend. Or at least Earl Haraldsen (earl being his title, not his name, and the Big Gammelost in town)doesn't and he decides what everyone else should or should not believe. The evidence is on his side; ships that sail west tend to disappear.Ragnar is played by Travis Frann. If they are not using some computer trickery to enhance them, he has the bluest eyes of any human on the planet. I mean, not just blue, but I'm Melting, melting, melting Blue. That kind of blue. His wife is also a beauty. Unfortunately she sports a Real Housewives of New Jersey teased beehive and eye make up has more than a touch of Passaic about it.Haraldsen is played by Gabriel Byrne, who is almost always good in any role and who is masterful in this one. He's not on screen all that much, but his character is the most interesting.  Haraldsen is a greedy and shortsighted man. A conniver, sneak and liar.  But that, he maintains, is how you hold onto your earldom. He has lost his 3 sons and heirs, but nevertheless in exchange for 20 pieces of silver, marries off his very young daughter to an Earl of Sweden. (He had some stuff Haraldsen been needin' -- sorry that just snuck out.)  He justifies the match to his wife by saying this ensures her safety...he saw his sons' dead bodies, mutilated, buried with their heads against their buttocks to humiliate them, and will do anything to safeguard the girl...even marrying her to Santa's ugly older brother. So maybe it's not just the money...In an early episode, Ragnar gets his hands on a revolutionary piece of new technology--a compass. With it, he can navigate a true course, rule the seas and find all those rich lands just lying there, ripe for the plucking. If there is an England, he's determined to find it and plunder it for all it's worth, Big Cheese or no Big Cheese edicts to the contrary. This voyage sets off an entire series' worth of fierce battles, betrayals, schemings, wheelings and dealings, pillagings, burnings and other and assorted bloody mayhem.  One thing about Vikings, they didn't just sit around playing cards after dinner.The scenes of Viking home life are particularly interesting and I'm intrigued enough to want to find out more. For instance, Ragnar happily offers his wife to a houseguest. And one of his crew does the same with his mate, providing a guest with just another amenity the way you or I might offer coffee and brandy after dinner.  I wonder if this is based in fact. And did some Viking warriors wear eye make up?  Floki, a key member of Team Ragnar albeit somewhat nutty, sports those Alice Cooper raccoon eyes.  Of course since he's a Viking, he could wear a feather boa and it would be wiser just not to say anything, but still, it piques the curiousity.  So do the conversations about Odin and Thor and Valhalla.  There is more to these people than kornmjolsgrot and blaber!Since Norse history was passed down orally until the 13th century, it is difficult to know where fact ends and legend takes over. Obviously this gives the series' writers considerable leeway. If they have taken liberties, so be it. What they give us in return is a beautifully filmed, overwhelmingly violent, multifaceted and extremely watchable television series. Not quite a five star effort, but certainly worth Four big ones.",Positive
"Elementary is an excellent show.  Usually on a new show the characters take a few episodes to coalesce.  Not here.  Holmes and Watson meld perfectly!

"I am truly amazed that I sat through this entire movie. However, you need to realize that I went into it knowing that it would be a train wreck, but it was far worse than I expected. ""Liz and Dick"" is a bloody massacre. For the record, I am actually a member of Team LiLo. As a child star, she showed great potential as a solid B-actress (remember ""The Parent Trap,"" Freaky Friday,"" and of course the iconic ""Mean Girls?""). Then Lindsay Lohan grew up, went to rehab 50 times, got arrested 105 times, and unfortunately she hasn't shown a whole lot of promise since then. I actually feel bad for her because she was so horribly miscast in this role. Lifetime obviously was desperate for viewers, and they cast LiLo as Elizabeth Taylor because they knew people like me would watch. And I did. And LiLo totally bombed.In fairness, the entire movie is an epic disaster (the only saving graces are the costumes, so props to the wardrobe mistress). First, let's talk about Lindsay. Ignore the fact that my cat looks more like Liz Taylor than LiLo does (as I recall, Liz's entire body wasn't covered in freckles). Unfortunately, LiLo put absolutely zero effort into preparing for this role. What you see for two hours is LiLo wearing a bunch of dark wigs, speaking in her regular LiLo voice. There was no attempt to master Liz's signature dialect, or the way she carried herself, or absolutely anything at all. Heck, she didn't even try to ACT most of the time. Everything was completely half-assed. Even when she was playing Angry Drunk Elizabeth and smashing bottles against the wall, her throws were just PITIFUL. It was insulting. The dude playing Richard Burton is only slightly better because he actually tries to act, but just happens to be a really bad actor (decked out in an even worse hairpiece). The sets are awful. The script is languid. And parts of the movie make no sense whatsoever. (Like, they constantly poke fun at Liz for being chubby, but I read that LiLo is so vain that she refused to wear any kind of fat suit for the film, so Richard is poking fun at fat Liz who is wearing skintight leather pants and can't weigh more than 105 pounds. Rewrite, anyone?)Everything. Is. SO. AWFUL. If you go into the film expecting to be entertained by watching really bad Lifetime television, like I was, you may end up pleasantly surprised in that ""Liz and Dick"" is ten times worse than anything you could have possible imagined it to be. My husband likened it to watching a high school theatre production, but I think that analogy is insulting to high school actors everywhere. Bottom line: Dame Elizabeth is rolling in her grave right now. I am glad she didn't live to witness this monstrosity.",Negative

The encounters between dedicated doctors and especially nurses and their mostly poor patients occur before any system of socialized medicine and at a time when several medical conditions---pregancy, attempted suicide---brought with them not only much social baggage but also the threat of police intervention.

"LAST NIGHT is a tightly woven tale that explores the psyches of four people in one fascinating evening. This is the initial directing outing for Iranian-American writer Massy Tadjedin ('The Jacket', 'Leo') who also created the story and the script: the film is so fine that we doubtless will be hearing more about her.Joanna Reed (Keira Knightley) is a beautiful young writer married to commercial real estate developer Michael Reed (Sam Worthington) in what appears to be a happy marriage despite the struggle between two careers. Michael takes Joanna to a company party and there she observes the soft spoken Michael paying attention to one of his co-workers, the sensuous Laura (Eva Mendes), an act that Joanna feels indicates unfaithfulness or at least suspicious behavior on Michael's part. The seed of doubt is planted, Michael is leaving for a business trip to Philadelphia the next morning with his coworkers Andy (Anson Mount) and Laura, and there is friction between Joanna and Michael that Michael's reassurance cannot overcome. The next day as Joanna sops for coffee she encounters an old flame from her time spent writing in Paris - Alex Mann (Guillaume Canet) - and they agree to meet that evening. Chemistry resurges and that evening as Alex and Joanna dine with Alex's publisher Truman (Griffin Dunne), both are questioned by Truman about their past affair, Joanna admits she is now married, and Alex is in a relationship in Paris. The couple leaves and circumstances lead them to return to Joanna's apartment where they face their feelings. At the same time as this evening is developing Michael and Laura enter a seduction dance: Michael is faithful to Joanna but the emotionally bruised Laura persists in her attempt to pull Michael into her web. The manner in which each of these temptations resolves and the aftermath is the brilliance of Massy's writing and direction: this is a story written very much form a women's vantage and that fact allows each of the characters to become very well defined and credible.The quartet of actors is well matched: Knightley continues to mature as a fine actress, Sam Worthington breaks out of his stodgy shell to allow us to see a man driven by fidelity and tempted by lust, Eva Mendes takes Laura to a higher dimension of being, and Guillaume Canet is undeniably an Alex who few women could resist: he has true star power. The method of pairing the development of the one night by flashing back and forth between the progress of the two couples in the dance of seduction vs fidelity is extremely successful. This is a thinking person's movie and an introduction of a writer/director who already has shaped the beginnings of a successful career. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, June 11",Positive

"We're only two episodes into this new NBC drama and it's already fallen apart at the seams. The show opens with Cuaron's directorial trademark of a technically clever tracking shot and after that it devolves into an incredibly dull series of totally unbelievable chases with absolutely zero character growth or plot development.The girl is blessed with some sort of telekinetic capability that she uses whenever the plot needs an escape catch. With this superpower, she should be the least vulnerable human on the planet but instead succumbs to an inept series of bad guys who can't decide whether to capture or kill her. She also seems to &#34;sense&#34; people's problems to get the B plot of the week going so she can run around helping people in between the good guys messing things up.The writing is on par with a first draft from a mediocre screenwriting student at a bad film school and it's almost inconceivable it was used for production. Every scene is littered with exposition throughout the script (&#34;You're a prisoner on deathrow and face execution.&#34; / &#34;You were trained at Quantico and now you're working on the Tate case&#34;). Hardly anything is said that isn't trying to explain the derivative back stories to the audience to the point where I'm screaming at the TV every time somebody utters one of these inane lines.The bad guys have a near-telepathic capability of knowing where she is at all times and the good guys do the worst job possible in keeping her out of harm's way, except when they use their own near-telepathic knowledge to protect her. The script conveniently forgets everything that goes before it (hey, there's a bag of money on a  fire escape in New York that's still there) and gives the audience no idea of where it's going beyond &#34;we're going to the safe house&#34; or &#34;we're going to Philadelphia&#34; - why not let's go to Disneyland and at least have some fun? Oh, and then major characters disappear - the laughably bad assassin from the pilot presumably didn't test well with the audience, even though they were the least demanding audience in history for liking the rest of the show.All the drama is developed from a simplistic triangle of good guys, bad guys (Kyle MacLachlan phones it in) and law enforcement all acting like IQs are dropping everywhere. They operate in a complete vacuum of reality so one moves and the others react and three chase sequences later we're at the end of the episode. And there's zero realism to any of the decisions made by the three groups pushing the wafer-thin plot forward so very, very slowly. There hasn't been this much stupidity in a TV show since The Following got renewed but admittedly even that managed to attempt to engage the audience.The acting is wooden, the dialog is stilted, the fight scenes are horribly shot, there no tension, there's no suspension of disbelief and there's no plot. How can it get any worse? Cuaron just won an Oscar but I suspect he's now lending his name like &#34;Steven Spielberg Presents&#34; - take away his and JJ Abrams' writing credits and here you have a show that would otherwise simply never be aired. It's a total train wreck of irredeemably poor writing and production that's reminiscent of the worst days of the Glen A Larson's factory weeklies. Absolute drivel in every respect and I'm embarrassed to say I watched two of these.",Negative

"MY CALL:  Looking for a film that features vampire chicks, zombies, poltergeists, aliens and even has elements of a ""house movie?""  Well, depending my interpretation of what I saw in the melee of clips from this film you may be in for all that and more...all be it in small doses.  We get to taste a lot of stories and ideas and, if we don't like one of the shorts after ten minutes, just wait ten more minutes for the next one to start.  If you like anthologies then don't miss this.Episodic horror anthology meets found footage as the movie opens with random home movies of three miscreants performing a series of arrestable offenses.  They seem to do what they do purely for fun and will surely deserve whatever ill-fate that may find them by this movie's end.Somehow one of these guys was offered a smash-and-grab job to steal a videotape from someone's home.  For some truly idiotic reason--though quite convenient for this movie's concept--not one, but two of these criminals decide to videotape this crime.  They break into the house and find the owner dead in an armchair, sitting in front of half a dozen TVs that are still on, besieged by VHS videotapes.  Anyway, clearly one of these guys never saw The Ring because he happily starts watching the tapes one after the other, alone, in the room with the dead guy who was watching the tapes!  As he watches his cohorts search the rest of the house and we watch the short films that comprise this episodic anthology.  Like many such episodic horror film, the introductory story additionally moves on briefly in between the shorts with interesting developments.These short films vary substantially in film, acting, gore, direction and writing quality.  The first, fourth and fifth (out of five) short films were much better than the second and third, both of which were so mundane I'd be happier if they were altogether omitted at the expense of the film's running time.  Below is a summary of each short film.Amateur Night.  A group of frat-type guys, one with a spy-camera in his eyeglasses, go whoring around town with the ambition of getting tits on film.  The spy-wared individual, later quite inebriated, picks up a pale, squirrely, large-eyed girl (Hannah Fierman; The Vampire Diaries).  After a healthy dose of seriously drunk driving, acquaintance rape and group sex, their squirrely girl goes absolutely feral.  What ensues is purely shock cinema, as if it wasn't already testing boundaries, complete with murder sex, bloody full frontal male and female nudity, gore, and genital dismemberment.  [Spoiled by the trailer...SPOILER from here...]  This chick, which I can only describe as a cross between a rabid cat-woman and a vampire, is truly creepy, awkward, brutal, sexy and terrifying all at once.  [...to here. End SPOILER]  The story ends on a cheesy, yet appropriate note.  This was a great shock-short with very strong make-up and effects.Director: David Bruckner (The Signal) really impressed me here.  I'd love to see this as an entire movie, but I'm not sure how that would work.  Of course, I thought that about Splice, which turned out fine in my eyes.Second Honeymoon.  A young couple (Joe Swanberg and Sophia Takal) take a road trip out west.  After retiring to their hotel room for the evening a young woman (Kate Lynn Sheil) knocks on their door and requests a ride, which the couple denies.  After they fall asleep...I'm not revealing anything else about this short, not that there's much to spoil.  The couple's dynamic is entertaining to watch, but the ""horror"" of the short just wasn't there and the attempted ""shock"" at the end wasn't shocking.Director: Ti West (The ABCs of Death, The Innkeepers) disappointed me here.  He was going for ultra-creepy but delivered nothing but lame.Tuesday the 17th.  This short combined the teleporting Jason Voorhees killer concept with the Freddy Krueger dream-killer meets White Noise premise mached-up via Blair Witch's shaky video camera.  Sound bold?  Maybe too bold?  This short never had a chance to develop and the delivery was cheap, uncreative and poorly executed.  The gore was also poor, though abundant.  Want to know about the plot?  Four college kids go to a lake house.  That's right.  They go to a Cabin in the Woods and it doesn't pay off for them or the viewers.  That about covers it.Director:  Glenn McQuaid (I Sell the Dead) got one thing right here.  Camera tricks.  They're no longer original, but they perked my interest before I lost interest in this short.The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily.  A guy has a series of Skype dates with his long distance college girlfriend (the very cute Helen Rogers).  Over the course of these recorded Skype calls (even though in the film they complain that they weren't recording them--yet here some criminal is watching them on a VHS tape in a dead guy's house) they investigate her ""haunted"" apartment.  The mood is good.  The scares were decent and made me jumpy.  There is also some very effective head-turning gore.  Not really gory, but a strong sort of off-putting in a couple scenes.  The ending makes no sense and even leads us to scratch our heads and question the true genre of the short.Director:  Joel Swanberg (You're Next) did well.  I liked getting to know the characters.  I found their couple's dynamic credible and interesting in a way that served the story quite well.  And I liked that it could make me jump...sort of...internally at least.  You know what I mean?10/31/98.  Four bros go to a Halloween party.  But the house is empty.  They explore, a few odd things happen, and they find some Klan rally-exorcism-virgin sacrifice evidently transpiring in the attic.  The bros try to save the damsel under the assumption that the aggressive hillbillies rallying around her are the bad guys.  From here, what started out as a seemingly aimless short turned into a fantastically done ""house movie"" escape with cool effects, some of which felt unique to this film.  Pulse-ghost-zombie arms reaching through the walls and the floors, objects flying about, a window actually shrinks so as to create a sense that the outside world was closed off to the house's captives...  really nicely done.Director:  ""Radio Silence,"" a troupe of several young directors, impressed me.  What doesn't impress me is their troupe name, which makes it difficult for me to follow their work and upcoming projects on IMDB.Just because I disliked a couple of these shorts in no way means this wasn't a fun experience.  We get to taste a lot of stories and ideas and, if we don't like one of the shorts after ten minutes, we just wait ten more minutes for the next one to start.  If you like anthologies then don't miss this.IF YOU LIKE THIS WATCH:  Trick 'r Treat (2007), the Creepshow franchise (1982, 1987, 2006), the upcoming more scene-than-story 26-short The ABC's of Death.",Negative
"Keeps drawing you into their circle. Mamas watch out, papas get the shotguns out. Can't wait to see Season 3.",Positive
"The series concept is excellent.  But the execution is just OK.  Lackluster direction and production (taking into account that the jury-rigged nature of the inventions is part of the charm).  And way too many flatulence jokes.  It's a solid start.  But the concept deserves significantly better execution.  However, if this is the best story they can come up with (and they've had a long time to work on the pilot), then I  caution against going into series with this show.",Negative
"I felt this pilot was one of the better ones released.  It was funny, realistic (to a degree), and seemed more in-line with what's going on now.  The main actor was dismal (not the one developing the code, but the other one), but I thought the other actors were funny.",Positive
"Creepy show that keeps you guessing what the plot will be next!!Only 1 drawback, it was not picked up for a second season.  : (  We are hoping the sci-fi channel or another independent will pick this up.  This type of supernatural phenomenon is not ready for prime time tv....come on sci fi!",Positive
"Season 1- Monk is a hilarious and an incredibly entertaining series. Three years earlier, Adrian Monk's wife, Trudy was murdered by a car bomb. He has extreme O.C.D. and relies on his Nurse/Assistant Sharona to help him while he solves murders with Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, and Lt. Randy Disher. Throughout the season Monk investigates an assassination attempt on a Mayoral Candidate, goes to an asylum, takes a vacation, deals with an earthquake, helps prove the innocence of Willie Nelson, and much more.Season 2- Monk's 2nd is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous season, perhaps even better. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his Assistant, Sharona. Throughout this season Monk investigates a murder at Trudy's high school, goes to Mexico, help prove the innocence of Sharona's sister during a stage play, figure out why a paperboy is killed for the newspaper, gets married, goes to jail, and finally gets a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 3- This is probably my favorite season. During the course of this season, we say good-bye to Sharona Fleming and hello to Natalie Teeger. Monk investigates Warrick Tennyson's role in Trudy's murder, gets fired, helps an organized crime family, becomes a contestant on a game show, gets stuck in traffic, goes to Las Vegas, adopts a kid, and much more.Season 4- Throughout this season Monk returns home on HALLOWEEN, stays in bed because he's sick, gets drunk, goes to a fashion show, figure out who would want to poison Stottlemeyer at the Christmas party, gets amnesia, stop a killer astronaut, and figure out if Trudy Monk had faked her death.Season 5- Throughout this season Monk deals with a garbage strike, loses his eyesight, attends his college reunion, goes to a rock concert, finally meets his dad, goes on the air, and much more.Season 6- Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 7- Monk is forced to find a new therapist because Dr. Kroger has died. Throughout this season Monk matches wits with a chess player, helps a boxer, gets stuck on a submarine underwater, meets his other brother, fights City Hall, and much more.The Final Season- In the end, all the pieces will fit together. Throughout this season, Monk serves as a bodyguard for his favorite actress, investigate a UFO sighting, goes undercover as a Mafia boss, celebrates his Birthday, receives a surprising visit from Sharona Fleming, and finally solves the murder of his wife, Trudy. It all comes down to this. This season felt a little rushed, but is the perfect ending to the Monk saga. I highly recommend MONK: THE COMPLETE SERIES!!!",Positive

"Somewhat of a &#34;Criminal Minds&#34; in the streets of London, the story center around the detectives solving serial murders or violent crimes in Jack the Ripper's old hunting grounds. The character development and the evolution of the relationships between the new and senior detectives are well done. As seems typical with BBC productions, the series consists only of a few episodes. There is one storyline running through the entire season, giving the series a mini-series feel (compared to the one story per episode format of American tv series). Well performed and well written.",Positive
"Absolutely love this show.  Found it on a different provider. Whatched season 1-3 went straight to amazon for season 4. Always liked soap operas, but this one is GOOD. Like the uncoruptable longworth & strong innocent cally. Love the product shots and car commercials they've integrated. Maybe they'll eventually make the episodes longer by eliminating commercial breaks.",Positive
"I really like this show. My family has had a ranch in Wyoming for decades now and I love the state. I realize that this isn't filmed there, but I must say that the locations in NM that they chose as stand-ins are not far off at all! Robert is a great actor and I believe that this part is perfect for him. I don't have cable, but the 3rd season has been worth every penny!",Positive
I like to see how the alien elements are integrated into new technology and fun characters.  Each episode is always entertaining.,Positive
Again with the sci-fi.  This one was an interesting take on doppelgangers and alternate worlds. I would have watch more seasons if they had been available.,Positive
Don't let your kids watch it because it is a little edgy....But it is no doubt a funny ass show.,Positive
"This show is good i have to admit. It's a guilty pleasure for me, but i really do enjoy watching it. I wish more season 3 were on there. but other that that, i Like it",Positive
"I am engaged enough to keep watching, but I am not altogether enamored of the acting, which occasionally seems inconsistent and/or overdone. Good enough, though.",Positive
Good acting in that you despise Eric Bana. Lots of action. The story makes you wonder if the police can really be that stupid.,Negative
"Four stars why? The plot is not that spectacular. The pilot of the show was brilliant, wildly inventive, well acted for the most part.The reason why I would give this show four comes down to &#34;Harvey Spector, Louis Litt and the pot smoking apprentice. Louis Litt I found especially appealing and authentic in his own weaselly, ingratiating and venal way, chased with a side of self awareness and jabs at redemption. Spector comes across as one dimensional- the episode where he meets up with a lost love I found totally unconvincing. But still, the panache with which he delivers the biting sarcasm of some of his best lines is oiled smooth precision and that doesn't come cheap. As for the apprentice, whose name I forget, the portrayal is honest and as sublime as one's going to get in the show. For the rest of them, pretty much cutouts with plot lines well confined to the specifics of a law office, I presume. Knowing atmosphere flows pretty well on the show, also.",Positive
"I didn't love this episode, but I definitely see potential in it as a series. The characters feel very one dimensional, and dumb, but I can see really liking this show once the characters and relationships have been fleshed out.",Negative
"I'm a huge fan of Carl Sagan and the first &#34;Cosmos&#34;, it's what inspired me to be a scientist myself.  I have to say Neil Tyson more than lives up to the legacy.  One thing I really like is that this isn't simply a rehash of the earlier series with better special effects.  While it certainly is inspired by the first series, Tyson embarks on his own path, giving some great insights into the history of science.",Positive
Real people and real life circumstances made this documentary very easy to watch and understand. It was well constructed and kept me very interested in watching it. I learned a lot too.,Positive
"Comedy in broad strokes is what. And this show delivers exactly that. If you like absurdist comedies, like the ""Naked Gun"" movies, you should like this one.Fortunately, we like this kind of comedy. We liked this show. Hope it makes it.",Positive
"Yep-Smart Alecs earning a living doing what they can do very well.  Good show. Entertaining and well written. Definitely not boring. So, I gave it 5 stars cause I like to see smart guys try to outsmart each other. And besides that, they are cute.",Positive
"Until the final frames of this season thriller, I had no idea which ""reality"" was true. At some point, I began to have my doubts that either were real. This was just a well-crafted series. I'm sorry to see that it was only a one-season show, but really, where would you go from the final episode? Unless...",Positive
"Talk about a drab, colorless, senseless film.I adore horror thriller based films but this clunker falls short of most any genre you can think of. It's washed out cinematography is only surpassed by even more washed out performances - it's as if they borrowed the premise of the Saw franchise minus the gore and genuine tension of the first and then proceeded to steal, at least to some degree the story line of ""The Game"" - and pulled the eyeball slicing right out of the classic horror/thriller ""Repulsion"".There is nothing here you won't see coming and nothing you haven't seen before.",Negative
The trailer for this movie shows the best parts. While the movie isn't bad it never lives up to it's potential. Very little action and slow moving. This could have been a great movie with a little tweaking. You certainly won't confuse this with &#34;Prometheus&#34; or any of the &#34;Alien&#34; movies.,Negative
"From the incredible fight scene that starts this first episode, to the brilliant and fascinating conversations had over questionable meals, to the devious and mysterious interactions Hannibal has with his own counselor and Will Graham, the entertainment just does NOT STOP!  Thrills and chills and action and gore--a serial killer's delight!This show is EASILY better than 98% of TV currently aired.  It is a miracle this show is broadcast free, because the production quality is high and the cast is impeccable.  Every episode is like a brand new major motion picture!Hannibal offers the gamut of cinematic experiences, from the deeply memorable to the shockingly gross.  It does so with eloquence, intelligence, and charm.BUY IT.",Positive

"This pilot was intriguing.  All these people get stuck on the elevator and then locked in the parking garage.  When one gets out to try and find help, she is stunned by what she sees.  The city is in utter chaos.  This is more than just a power failure.  All the people on the stranded elevator have the same birthday.  What's with that?  We have a French actress, a police officer, a clown, a felon with a shotgun, who seems to be trying to help and declares his innocence, a diabetic, rich elderly lady who lives with just her housekeeper in this mansion.  Are all the characters going to be more developed and the ending was just so unexpected.  You have to see more episodes to see what is going on.",Positive
"Great as always, although this season has definite darker plot lines.  I'm very sad to see Matt Smith leave, though, next season.",Positive
"The program just does not have the spark it did last season.  Two major changes are big big mistakes.  The new cast replacement for the oldest daughter was NOT a good idea.  Nor was the decision to make her caustic.  And finally, there is just no excuse for the frequency with which we have to bear the grandson's father.",Negative

"The question is ""Did We Really Need to Rebuild Her?"" After watch all eight episodes of this Bionic Woman remake, I say NO!This last TV season NBC choose to remake the Bionic Woman for the 2000's. In trying to gain success like Sci-Fi Channel had the other 1970's remake  Battlestar Galactica, The producers took a gritter style...and It failed on many levels.As lovely as Michelle Ryan is, she is NO Lindsay Wagner. Ms Ryan tries to give this piece heart. The Character , a bartender , is given her bionics after an auto accident with her Government surgeon boyfriend.  She is saddled her with a felony kid sister (Lucy Hale) who was dumped on her when their father disappeared. Ryan is one of the reason's to watch this show.However, the heart of the show is buried deep within sub plots of the previous sort of Evilish bionic woman Sarah (Katee Sackhoff from the remake Of Gallatica) and ideas of double crossing people that seemed to be ripped off from old ALIAS plots. This new Woman is told is a soap opera form, which weaken this piece.The highlight of the show after Ryan  is Miguel Ferrer as the mysterious  Jonas. He plays a tough as nails agency boss, better than Richard Anderson ever played Oscar Goldman. His stone cold demeanor works well in this character, better than he did in Crossing Jordan (which season one is coming on DVD soon)The funnest thing about this new Bionic Woman. She  has $50,000 dollars worth of bionics parts, up from the 1970's amount of six million..inflation, inflation, inflation!I am sadden that only eight episodes (which are all presented here) were made of this series before the writer's strike of TV season 2007-2008. It had promise, but we may never know if it could have developed. NBC Network  has not stated if this show has been renewed for the next season. So these eight episodes may be the only  episodes of this seriesI can only wish that someone would release the classic Six Million Dollar man or the original Bionic woman on DVD...Now that was great television!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",Negative
"I didn't expect to like this series as much as I did. I generally find Agatha Christie a little simple-minded but this has been the perfect antidote to a stressful summer. David Suchet makes a perfect Poirot, the supporting cast are delightful but it's the sets and costumes that leave me gaga. I adore art deco and the architecture, furniture, costumes, cars and product designs in this series are a feast for the eyes. Very enjoyable.",Positive
"Note: I saw all 12 episodes of Season I in HD via XFinity On Demand.This television series is, thank God, nothing like Gladiator, which depicted Romans carrying weapons in the Senate, which was strictly proscribed, and Romans wearing tattoos, which they despised on account of the barbarian nations they conquered who did wear them. The series does get some historical details right, and there may be facts which have been fudged up. The performances are first-rate, and the costumes and sets have been well-done.Be Warned: Contains graphic violence, female/male nudity & sexuality (in some episodes) and modern/Roman swear words.",Positive
"I love this season, and I sometimes watch an episode more than once. The actors are all so good, and the storylines are always very interesting.",Positive
"I have thoroughly enjoyed this series and look forward to more of it. I am hopeful that I will see the stars in additional series, also.",Positive
Always liked him - since Hackers. He plays an emotionally stunted Sherlock perfectly and the plots are very interesting. Character development is a bit slow but it raises the audience's curiosity into his past. Not crazy about Lucy Lu - never smiles and is a bit too cold.,Positive
Don't know how Robert Irvine doesn't wind up with a heart attach.  The joys he picks are really challenging and then the only get worse.  He's really great to watch and each time he shows some really nice recipes that I will probably try to duplicate.,Positive
"As the series goes on it becomes apparent, that you are watching the greatest zombie apocalypse based film work of all time (IMHO), and like all great shows ********SPOILER ALERT AHEAD********* (see the final season/episodes of Breaking Bad) no character is safe from death or injury, you know like in real life, where stuff happens to even the best of us. Shows without real consequences for major characters don't interest me. This show delivers on the promise of even the good have to go, and isn't afraid to take out anyone no matter how many fans love them or not. Story telling is front and foremost here, if it fits the story then off they go, no cliffhangers that always seem to rescue the major characters (Grey's Anatomy I'm pointing my finger at you and your plane crash, yes a couple of characters die but not one of the originals went anywhere). No Red Shirts here everyone is fair game. If you haven't seen the show from the beginning do yourself a favor check out the major streaming services and catch up quick it comes back October 13th.",Positive
One of those shows you can watch with the kids without worrying about someone dropping an F-bomb or something.  It doesn't necessary paint Cajun folks in the best light.  It has some very humorous moments to offset any intensity.,Positive
"Another take on a dinner party gone weird. But the storyline is executed differently with an unusual crowd. I've seen it more than once. A movie has to be interesting for more than one viewing. All the actors are true to their roles and tension steadily builds. Great indie. I hate spoilers, so I'll say no more.",Positive
What is not to love a Tardis and dinosaurs and fun. Really well written. Enjoyed every episode so far. Waiting to see what's next. I do not mind paying for these episodes I find them worth the price.,Positive
"This is a series not for the squeamish!  The French King is a little brutal,  not to say that he wasn't in real life, but right on screen.  This is an adult +18 type show!",Positive
"I keep telling myself I'm not going to watch these soapy, gimmicky science fiction stories; then, I watch a few episodes and I'm hooked.  Stephen King writes good fiction and generally the film versions tend to disappoint; but, this one caught me.  Lots of science flaws, but the &#34;Dome&#34; is just a McGuffin anyway, a device for moving the story along; which is really about the character's lives and the interplay of good and evil.I hope this doesn't go on too long and ruin it.  &#34;Season 1&#34; sounds ominous, there should only be one season.  It needs to come to a conclusion soon.",Positive
"The writers weave this series together in continuously surprising ways. Matt Smith is as quirky as ever and Jenna-Louise is an equal, not just a side-kick. We can't wait to see how she manages to come back next and how the Doctor finds her. What IS her extraordinary history?",Positive
"""Rome"" is my personal favorite miniseries ever.  It has a gritty authenticity that transports the viewer to the Rome of Julius Caesar's time.  The acting is first rate, the storylines are terrific, there is very little not to like about this miniseries.  My favorite aspect of this series is the friendship that develops between Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson).  The character study of the differences between these two men is really fascinating.""The Stolen Eagle"" is the first episode of the miniseries and one of the best.  Julius Caesar concludes his war in Gaul and must now confront the Senate over his future.  Well, we all know what happens next, but this episode and series make it suspenseful nontheless.Highly recommended.  RJB.",Positive
"Season 5 24 is fantastic.  Each episode gets more and more exciting!  I keep thinking, it can't get any better than this, but guess what!  It does! Fantastic show, no show can beat 24!  I am a wreck when its over, but I love it so!",Positive
"I am recommending all of season 5 of this series, not just one episode.Denis Leary's enflamed New York city firefighter Tommy Gavin is back. I find Tommy Gavin an interesting character but at times it is frustrating that nothing of Denis Leary the stand-up comic with the zingers at the ready and the educated man (MFA from Emerson college) shows through. I suppose this shows Leary's commitment to Gavin as a character.Perhaps more than any other factor, what shows in this season is Gavin as a substance abuser, an alcoholic. He is in AA and he is out of AA. He fights with the priest constantly about their problems with alcohol. The other firemen open a bar and he gets involved with it and drinking there. His girlfriend allows him to drink but his wife does not. An unrecognizable Michael J. Fox does a brilliant job of playing Gavin's wife's new boyfriend who is wheelchair bound. He and Gavin briefly bond as maimed characters on just about every level, including substance abuse. It's hard to upstage Leary but Fox manages it. I was sad that Fox did not become a permanent character on the series but I suppose he was not interested in doing tv long term. Maybe they can bring him back next season for a few episodes as well since he was not killed off.Gavin the firefighter is also on considerable display in this season. Perhaps his inability to conquer his inner demons is what makes him courage personified with rescuing people in burning buildings. He can even cope with burned bodies which other firemen can't face without becoming ill.The least satisfying aspect of this series is Gavin's continuing problems with his girlfriend and his wife and the other few women who briefly alight in his life. I can't stand either the wife or the girlfriend as characters and would be happy if somehow they were eliminated from this series. I wish they would bring back Tatum O'Neal more, Gavin's sister. At least she was a female character with whom we could sustain interest.Of the other firefighters, Sean is the most interesting one in this season because he gets cancer (probably from 9/11 exposure) but must get surgery on the sly because he wants to remain in the fire department as a fighting fireman. We also discover that Sean can SING in some very imaginative dream sequences while he is unconscious. Kenny wants to marry a prostitute and the Chief is married to a promiscuous woman he brought over from Russia. This seems very strange to me and I have no idea if this bears any relationship to what choices real firefighters would make as to women to marry. That they are able to convince themselves that they can reform these women is black comedy.",Positive
"If you like Ireland and like mysteries, this is a successful combination of the two.  The Garda Sergeant Jack Driscoll (Owen McDonnell) returns to his remote, western Ireland home town (filmed in Connemara) after working in Dublin.  The locals think that because he is one of them he might let them off the hook for some of their crimes and misdemeanors.  But he is principled, unlike his father who was a former policeman there, and he wants to obey the law.  This causes conflict in the community with the crimes he works on.  The scenery is majestic, the plots are compelling and not too grisly, and the characters feel real.  If you watch mysteries as a kind of travelscape, this is something different.  It's too bad it only had two seasons, but it's a fun addition to the genre. 4.5 stars",Positive
Never get tired of Psych. I want all seasons.,Positive
A. S. Season 2 - was even more surprising; more revelations; the story more twisted - a shocking conclusion - a bit &#34;sick&#34; - but I still watched.  You will too!,Positive
"The countryside is gorgeous, Galway, Ireland what's not to like? The actors mostly up and coming, none of whom I recognized, the storyline, tried and true.A dad, calls his three children home, he has something he wants to talk about. Is he ill, is he in trouble, what is going on? The three children all return home, one with her husband and two children, one with his current girl in tow, and one all by himself. The secret it turns out is not too scary. And, all of the children bring secrets of their own. This is billed as a dysfunctional modern Irish family, but, in reality, it is a normal family coming together two years after the death of their mother.There are some fun times, lots of boring, nothing really said times, fair acting, but nothing in this film grabs you to really want to know more. The scenery is the best bet, and there is a lot to see. We visit pubs where everyone gets drunk, children's playground, cemetery, and scenes of the farm, which looks nice enough. Which does make me wonder how the dad all by himself kept the place looking so good.  When all is said and done there is no big family meeting to settle things, it seems it is all done in small groups, or by looks, but we are not privy to too much of the conversation.Really a film for Seinfeld fans, about nothing.Recommended For The Scenery.  prisrob 02-22-14",Negative
"Totally loved this series.  Tense, compelling and well crafted.  I want more and will watch for these actors in other venues.",Positive
"because I dislike when villains leave the hero conveniently alone so the hero can escape.  And how about when the Liam Neeson character was about to be taken captive and the villains kindly allowed him to place a telephone call.  Filmmakers need to make smarter villains.  There were what twenty villains, and they were all looking at telly or sleeping, when their job was to be guarding Liam and his ex-wife; how do villains keep their job if they do it so poorly - not believable they were all so inept.  I did like the use of the daughter, I think she has the makings of an agent herself and hope that future sequels pursue that story line.  Dislike the editing, cut so choppily I could barely tell what's happening during the fight sequences.  Two and a half stars.Final thoughts: I think the Liam Neeson character needs to train his ex-wife/daughter so they at least have some defensive skills, as often as not one or both are in the thick of things in these films.  What if the Liam character gets shot; it'd be great if the women could take care of themselves or maybe even rescue him should he ever need it. Having everybody strong, including the women, would be great to see.",Negative
"There were one or two that dropped in excitement a little, but all in all great story. The actors developed and interacted well. To bad it ended after only two seasons.",Positive
"""The Tudors"" is unlike any television show ever broadcast. The series is wonderfully produced with a huge budget, the acting is worthy of Oscars, and the story, although told before, is presented here fresh and is excitingly original. This 10 episode series dramatizes the life of King Henry VIII of England and his attemmpts to have a male heir for his dynasty as well as the international problems that beset him. The first season details the King's attempts to divorce his wife, Katherine of Aragon, and his lust for Anne Boleyn. The series is racy with many explicit sex scenes, but what makes ""The Tudors"" work are its strong scripts and the acting by its leads, most notably Jonathan Rhys Meyers who portrays Henry not only as a hungry sexual predator, but a man who loves his country and his people. The series won many Emmy nominations, most notably one for Meyers, for his soaring portrayal. ""The Tudors"" is beautifully produced, with amazing costumes and sets that add to the lustre of the series. In all four seasons worth of episodes will been made with seasons 2 and 3 available on DVD (season 3 comes out on DVD in early 2010).",Positive
"A show about a symphony? Who would think that this would be something that folks would want to watch? That's what I thought about when I read that Amazon would have a pilot about a symphany. One thing that made this show was the fact that the world of the syphany is something that most people have no concept of. Letting those of us who will never get a look behind the curtain get a peek makes for interesting watching.Brilliantly acted, brilliantly written. This show was fast paced, but it was right for the material. I'm hoping that if it's picked up, there'll be more of the Malcolm McDowell-Gael Garcia Bernal interactions. This is one show that I want to see more of.",Positive

"creepy movie. it's hard to believe that it's based on true events. i urge you to go to wikipedia and read about the real story. such a contrast to the glammed out movie. there was nothing glamorous about the real events. in the end, the whole thing just felt yucky and scary. not for the faint of heart. i gave it three stars because i don't like scary flicks, and i didn't realize that it was going to be so creepy. also, it makes me wonder how and why hollywood sensationalizes events in history when the actual events are sad, gruesome and just plain awful.",Negative
I am enjoying the series but not sure where the story line will take us or if it will get so convoluted that my interest will wain - will see.,Positive
"Watched this on the basis of seeing Benedict Cumberbatch in an earlier production and was not at all disappointed.  Ok, I am disappointed there was not a subsequent season to watch.  The Cumberbatch character returns to a much changed England to attend his brother's funeral.  Everyone now must have a personal ID card in order to buy anything, get transportation or enter any where, including your own home.  He meets his brother's wife and is instantly attracted to her.  What follows is a story of intrigue and conspiracies that keeps you guessing as to who the good guys and the bad guys are.  The end of this 5 episode series is as unpredictable as the rest of the series.  Four stars only because I really wanted to see another season.",Positive
"My favorite series...unpredictable, cleverly written, great characters, and just plain fun to watch. It's an interesting view into a corporate law firm that most of us never get to see.",Positive
"It's gotten to where I can't trust any of these shows. In search of Bigfoot, Seasons 1-4, and they never find Bigfoot, and all they can provide is about a dozen blurry photos or videos and a couple of eye shine shots! This haunted mine series is FAKE, just like the others. The cast consists of paid actors and a set they blew up when the season ended. Never fear, though; they found another mine coincidentally that's even bigger and scarier than the first. But will the execs sign off on it? Probably. This is why MGM sacked good quality shows like Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis for low budget garbage like this. Also, if you're going to be a ghost hunter, stop screaming every time you see a shadow person or hear a voice. If you're going to be doing this for a living, grow a backbone fer goodness sake! And please stop doing the EVPs where you conduct scrappy ghost interviews. ""Is anyone here? How many of you are there? Do you want us to leave?"" I could write this stuff in my sleep!",Negative
I love scary movies and this one is another one to add to the to buy list. I'm starting to get out of them more gory junk and really enjoying movies that scare! I recommend this to anyone that likes the kind of paranormal activity type movies. Enjoy!,Positive
"Actors are great. Could be any party affiliation, but happens to be Republican. Enjoy the comedy, and be glad your congress person is a model citizen---NOT!",Positive
"Season 1,2 and now 3 are great. The stars in this show are really experienced actors. This show is unique, in it's ability to show sacrifice and heroism that come naturally to Reese, Harold, and Carter.",Positive
"&lt;strong>Jsan-nin no Shikaku&lt;/strong> (Takashi Miike, 2010)Takashi Miike has long been one of Japan's most innovative, versatile, and original directors while still managing to be one of its most prolific at the same time. Despite this, he managed to labor in relative obscurity in his home country for almost a decade before exploding onto the international scene with &lt;em>Audition&lt;/em> in 1999. He experienced a brief period of worldwide notoriety, releasing such smashes as &lt;em>Visitor Q&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Ichi the Killer&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>The Happiness of the Katakuris&lt;/em> before slipping back into obscurity. Why this happened, the world will likely never know, but it was only a matter of time before they took notice again. Another decade later and &lt;em> Jsan-nin no Shikaku&lt;/em>, released in English-speaking countries as &lt;em>13 Assassins&lt;/em>, kicked off a second, and hopefully more enduring, wave of Miike-love in the west. &lt;em>13 Assassins&lt;/em> is a film from Miike's growing obsession with the historical-drama subgenre, in which he has quietly built up a reputation for releasing fantastic movies that never received the media coverage of his bigger, showier releases.Plot: Lord Naritsugu (&lt;em>Saimin&lt;/em>'s Gor Inagaki) is next in line for the Shogunate. No one, including the existing members of the Shogunate, want him to actually take a seat. So when a member dies and Lord Naritsugu begins his journey from Edo, thirteen assasins are hired to stop him. The first half-and-change of the film is the assassins training to form a coherent unit, with us getting to know them, as well as Hanbei (Masachika Ichimura, who has since become a Miike regular), Naritsugu's personal bodyguard and the assassins' chief opposition, and Naritsugu himself. (Naritsugu is a bad guy. And I mean a &lt;em>bad&lt;/em> guy, one so bad only Hanbei's honor stops him from deserting Naritsugu once he realizes what a morally bankrupt morass of evil this guy is.) Then comes the climactic battle, which most people characterize as the second half of the film. I timed it; it's actually forty-seven minutes. There's a coda afterwards that ties everything up in semi-satisfactory fashion (as long as you're at least passing familiar with certain aspects of Japanese mythology). But the second half of the movie is definitely focused on the forty-seven minutes of stunning choreography, brilliant atmosphere, and unrestrained violence of that final fight scene.Miike's remake of a 1963 period piece (of the same name, directed by Echi Kudo) is faithful, from what I have read of the original, which is still somewhat hard to come by, but it also draws pretty heavily from &lt;em>Seven Samurai&lt;/em>. At no point, however, can this be mistaken for anything but a Miike film, as is true with all of Miike's best work. And this certainly qualifies as some of Miike's best work; the first half is quiet and tense, the second absolute chaos, and they show a director with an ability to work just as easily in both while creating the proper atmosphere for each. Not an easy task. (Note how the lighting suddenly gets really, really gloomy, after a gradual fade throughout the film, as the assassins are preparing the ambush, for example.) There are those little touches of Miike wackiness, though some of them take, shall we say, a darker turn (the incident that causes the assassins to be hired, when its aftermath is finally depicted, is the hardest scene it's been to watch for me in a Miike film since the final fifteen minutes of &lt;em>Audition&lt;/em>), there's the usual we're-not-QUITE-overacting-but-we're-really-enjoying-dancing-on-that-line, there's Miike's ever-honed sense of pace. In short, it's Takashi Miike. Short of someone who can't stomach violence, I can't imagine anyone not liking this, just as I can't imagine anyone not liking &lt;em>Sabu&lt;/em> or &lt;em>Ley Lines&lt;/em> or &lt;em>The Bird People in China&lt;/em>. It's far too early to call this a classic, but I think when the chips shake out half a century from now, people will still be watching &lt;em>13 Assassins&lt;/em>. ****",Positive
"O Happy Day! As presented in widescreen, here's Season 2 of Bones. The great news is that there's no slack off at all from season one's most excellent run. Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama, humor, pathos, and tenuous romance. Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) continue to dazzle as television's most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person, Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark. She remains dispassionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail, the truth. As always, her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases. As ever, the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the, to her, bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum. Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones' supremely confident exterior. She and Boreanaz are magical, and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There's a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode, but that doesn't keep me from being sofa-ed in rapt attention. This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth's: ""Keep talking. I'll catch up."" The mysteries are compelling enough, but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements, it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more. The squints, while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks, are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters. The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky, bolstered by this season's newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O'Neal, Stephen Fry, and the wonderful Patricia Belcher (as no-nonsense attorney Caroline Julian). It must be noted that T.J. Thyne (Hodgins) and Michaela Conlin (Angela) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls, beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan (Taylor) as Brennan's new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute, with whom Bones instantly clashes. Then mix in some office romances (except the one we're hankering for). Offer up a serial killer or two. And, thru all the cases she works on, Bones still fixates on her mother's unsolved murder and her father's disappearance. On this, some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are ""The Truth in the Lye"" (Tub of goo!! So cool tub of goo!! To quote Bones: ""Even for me, this is disgusting.""), ""The Woman in the Sand"" (Booth goes ultimate fighting and, Omigawd, Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress!), ""Aliens in a Spaceship"" (Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out; raw-emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel), the nerve-wracking ""The Blonde in the Game"" and its equally harrowing follow-up ""The Man in the Cell"" features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season's ""A Man on Death Row"") and the season-ender ""Stargazer in the Puddle"" (Bones learns more about her mother).Special Features include optional episode commentaries on ""The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House"" (with Emily Deschanel) and on ""Stargazer in a Puddle."" Boreanaz doesn't commentate this time; perhaps, his effort last season was deemed too loopy. Disc 6 offers ""The Memories in the Season"" featurette; ""Visceral Effects: The Digital Illusions of Bones"" featurette; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers; and the gag reel.By the way, the episode commentary on ""The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House"" reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season. Does that mean there'll be 23 episodes in season 3? One hopes (but doubts).",Positive
This is yet another great installment of the walking dead.  I think Season three has recaptured some of the qualities that made season one so great (and seemed lacking in season two).,Positive
I am not familiar with the UK version but they must have changed head writers because the character archs are shifting from whom has the guilt trip and WHY Can't JOSH grow a PAIR! UGH,Positive
"Season 1 was Hot, a different legal show about child legal services.  The stories were true to life and heartbreaking.  Season 2 had a serious bad turn with the death of supporting actor Charles Whitfield, (James Mooney).  This was big mistake to remove James from the story line because he added the needed tension to keep the script grounded not to mention it removed the only Black attorney from the show.  When Mooney was removed the show became a romantic soap opera.  By the time Season 3 came around, Nick who everyone had waited to come to achieve the throne of the Fallin Law firm is again pushed down and then out of the firm all together.  His romantic life that the script teased on viewers totally failed and the character of Shannon the young girl in foster care with Burton Fallin slowly fades into the background. The last episode of Season 3 left me with a sad and depressed feeling because it seemed that not one person was able to overcome their emotional baggages.",Positive
"I enjoy this show, and the people in it. This season seems to be filled with some things that are just too good to be true. I hope that they aren't exaggerating things on this show for ratings because that would be disappointing. I prefer boring and truthful to outrageous and a lie.",Positive
"Delve into Morgan Freeman's Wormhole in this series that explores the dark regions of unanswered questions. Tightly edited, this cheeky exploration really satisfies, like a fine dark chocolate. The production doesn't fudge a thing as it probes into the recesses of speculation. It doesn't turn a blind eye to controversy but not in a simple way that presents everything as either white or black but more of an in-between brown that comes off without the stink of failure. I highly recommend Morgan Freeman's Wormhole. I really got into it. You'll enjoy it so much you'll be coming on back!",Positive
"I have a 9 year old son.  We used to watch this series when he was younger - it was one of our favorites.  Recently, he began watching them again with our prime video subscription.  We both enjoy it as much as ever.",Positive
The cast is great and perfectly cast. I watched the entire 1st season in a week and the second season the following week.,Positive
"We stumbled over Burn Notice early in the game while visiting friends for the weekend. As we don't own a television (don't worry, you'll get to that point as well... eventually) the concept of on-demand shows was amazing. The characters are loveable rogues that blow things up and out-wit their adversaries. I'll be sorry to see this show retired. Thankfully, it will live forever in the on-demand archives I'm sure.",Positive
"I like the new Major Crimes with all the cast from The Closer though I still prefer the Closer and wish Kyra Sedgwick hadn't quit the series. With her went some of the other actors parts and hopefully they had some other place to go though the new series that Jon Tenney stars in now King and Maxwell seems to be doing OK. JK Simmons who played Pope is doing Farmers Insurance commercials as well as some movies. What happened to Corey Reynolds whose character supposedly left with Brenda? I haven't seen him show up anywhere so far.Mary McDonnell is great and I really like how they have softened her character a bit with her taking in Rusty and a really nice relationship has developed there. Now they have brought in her ex-husband so that is proving to create some interesting situations. Of course the transition would not have been complete without the characters of Flynn and Provinza and the interesting capers they get themselves into. I think in time this series will be as good and if possible maybe better than The Closer.I do know I am getting tired of actors and actresses that are up and quitting after being on a successful series. Now we get to look forward to Cote de Pablo's leaving NCIS after the first 2 episodes of the new season after being a very integral member of team Gibbs for 7 years. God, it's almost like the 7 year itch is hitting these actresses. I just hope this doesn't mean she will drop out entirely from working before the camera.",Positive
"I love this show.  The adult characters are hilarious together and when interacting with the kids.  When the kid scenes are on, I find myself waiting fo the scene to end so the adults to come back as I find the kids characters a bit annoying.  But the awesomeness of the adult characters outweighs the annoying kids.",Positive
"The BBC creates some of the best mysteries on television and they are not at all afraid of delving into the &#34;Dark Side&#34; of their leading characters. Wallender comes to mind as a series whose lead character is fairly seriously flawed, even to the point of being uncomfortable to watch at times. Well, Touching Evil makes Wallender look like walk in the park so be advised. It is very dark with almost no lighter moments and each following episode after the first seems to get darker. I'll not give away any details but be prepared. You'll enjoy the series (make that &#34;become enthralled&#34; because &#34;enjoy&#34; just isn't the right word) like a book you can't put down. I give it four stars because it's a Really Good Show (apologies to Ed), just not very fun to watch.Hope this makes sense...",Positive
"As always, I totally love NCIS, but the vote is still out on the new character, Bishop.  She knows too much and the long-time characters bow down to her and give the probie way too much slack.  Plus, she's got this perpetual frown like she's always in deep thought.  Very unattractive and not convincing.",Positive
i love this show i was a fan of the british series then they stopped but the American series is excellent i think the stories are great it so similar and so different at the same time if you like the british series you like the this one check it out you might like it(yeah you will!),Positive
"Thanks Amazon!! I am enjoying the French Chef, she is entertaining and unassuming. Tonight I am making this recipe, Boeuf Bourguignon. French cooking is a lot easier than I had ever imagined.",Positive
This is a very cute show for kids to learn with! They will have fun while they learn about all kinds of animals,Positive
"Could have been great but suffered from the same old fate, Greed! It had great ratings so more seasons had to take seed. Instead of a one off like Fargo, CBS wanted to make more dough. So stretched out and a bunch of garbage plot will follow, some good episodes, but plenty of turds you'll have to swallow.",Negative
"Potentially this is a great series, but after a few episodes I felt it wasn't getting anywhere. There seems to be a lack of intensity, with story lines that just drift off. I am sure it will all come together in the end, but I don't think I will stick around since I am not enjoying it enough to wait. However, the concept is fascinating and the acting is excellent.",Negative
"I was a little skeptical after the fist season ended since Christopher Eccleston was no longer going to be The Doctor.  I really loved him.  But, since I had become a fan of the series, I decided to give the 2nd season a try, starting with the Christmas episode...David Tennant's first episode.I am so glad I gave it a try!  David Tennant's interpretation of the 10th Doctor is superb.  He is great fun to watch.  If you are not sure about this season, give this episode a try ... you won't be sorry!",Positive
Feels very much like a cross between &#34;Strangers with Candy&#34; and &#34;Always Sunny in Philadelphia&#34;. Hapless idiot teachers try to conquer a world of smarter children and fail. A few good lines but they're going to have to work on developing this into something more/better. At least in Always Sunny I feel like the heroes have half a brain and just misuse it. Here I feel like they're just dumb.,Negative
"We always want peace, but when we get it, we want to fight more.  The morals in this series in astonishing.  You must look and find what is really happening here.  It is not just about aliens but about how we handle situations when out friends become the enemy.All three series were worth the watch.  I will look forward to season 4",Positive
"Both my wife and I are still enjoying &#34;White Collar&#34;.  We must be addicted to it.  Well written and well executed, we will be very sorry when this series finally ends.",Positive
Series like this I find educational as well as being entertaining.  I have not found one episode to be boring.  The ideas are interestingly worked out each week in a mere 43 minutes.,Positive
"I love this series.  The actor is one of my favorites and now the actress also.  The story is good, and the character interaction allows you to become a part of the plot and the family.  I really like the way that is incorporated.  I would recommend this to my friends, and anyone that enjoys a light criminal investigation and romance.",Positive
I enjoyed the pilot but have to say I don't see this show lasting for too long.  The narration gets a little tedious and it's kind of a &#34;hug and learn&#34; sort of sitcom.  That being said love JK Simmons and would watch again.,Negative
"Love this series.  Watched all 3 seasons and I wished there were more.  I loved all the charactors and couldn't wait to see were each episode was going to take themand how the village would pull together.  I will probably watch these seasons all over again,  that's how good this program is.",Positive
This is a standout season for me for a few reasons. It has several excellent players with big personalities and one heck of a villain. Very entertaining! I love Survivor and really hope Amazon starts offering more seasons for Prime Members.,Positive
"We Love this show wish it never ended, new eposide every week. Can't wait till next season, hope the storyline stays strong",Positive
"I love reality tv and this is great reality tv because the people are so over the top. There were times where my husband looked at me and said this cannot be real, people are not really this way right?  And then later he said wow I think they are real.  You just can't make this stuff up!  It seriously feels like watching a demolition derby train wreck spectacular.Intermixed is some pretty dancing too. The things the girls can do with their bodies is pretty phenomenal too.",Negative
So far this is pretty good. I don't know how attached I am to any of the characters but I think they'll grow on me and the story lines have been interesting.,Positive
"I'm continually amazed how a subject which you think has no more gas left in the tank has new life breathed into it.Here's the scoop. A screenwriter (Milo Ventmiglia) falls for a gal (Josephine de la Baume) who turns out to be a vampire. He finds this out but allows her to ""turn"" him because he's so in love with her. Her sister (also a vampire) arrives at the home and throws everything up for grabs.Many have called this an homage to the 70's vampire flicks. Other than some cheesy, Euro sounding music from that period, I found this much better than what Hammer and like-minded studios were pushing back then. This is better all the way around. Certainly tech oriented aspects of film making have improved over the decades, so this looks a lot better than its predecessors. But the writing is much better as well. This digs deeper to the heart of what it's like to be a vampire in a human's world. There is even a rather philosophical discussion to that effect during one of the parties. Then there's sis, the loose cannon. The vampire community cannot afford to have someone like her running loose and killing at will. Her actions could destroy them in a heartbeat were she to draw too much attention. Then there's the acting. All the primary characters do a fine job. You build up sympathy for the two principals because they are genuinely in love. One odd note was the appearance of Michael Rapaport. He has nearly no screen time. How is it he's in this film? But I like him and he adds the weird Michael Rapaport 'thing' to the proceedings. But this is a very good effort overall.I have a few years under my belt and have seen my share of vampire flicks. Too many of them offer up nothing new. So when something like this comes along, that whacks up the side of my head with a curve ball, it's well worth seeing.",Positive
"I don't think there will be a season 2 because this isn't a drama, it's more of a reality experiment that failed during the three months a group of people divided by caste; servants versus a British lordly family living in a 96 room restored manor house in the very early 1900's complete with two bathing rooms, chamber pots and a wood burning stove for the chef.Speaking of the chef, there were several close up shots of the man's hand's complete with dirty hands and especially blackened nails. That was too much reality for me even though I watched all the segments hoping 'til the bitter end for someone to explain the purpose of it all - I still don't know............",Negative
I chose this rating because the pilot was awesome! I'm just barely on episode 5 but it's keeping my attention.,Positive
"i have had cats or my entire life and have actually learned more than a few things from this show and its host, a musician by night and a at behaviorist by day! This is more than just intuitive stuff, it treats cats as the predators that they are, and teaches you about their inner life. One of my favorites on Discovery.",Positive
This is a wonderful show.  It is great to see a totally new show with such wonderful acting and writing.  So often on network TV you don't get that combination.,Positive
"The Killing was a GREAT show on AMC - it has just been canceled and only lasted 2 seasons.  Does not end on a note that devastates the viewer, you will get closure.  Very entertaining and good twists.",Positive
The movie overall was disappointing. Just the way that it was portrayed then how it played out was not at all good. It was ok.,Negative
"Odd ball comedy that works through the chemistry of the actors.  Reminds of my first two years of college, which it makes it funny but also scary when I remember those years.  Anyway, enjoy one of the best comedies on TV and now on Cable today.",Positive
"I enjoy all the episodes, all seasons. For this season, both the Pirate specials and Exploding Water Heater are worth repeated viewing.",Positive
"we sat down as a family to find a cool sic-fi show to simply sit and watch as a family where we would not worry about damage to our kids. This was surprisingly a fun, well crafted story with less cheese factor; more actor quality and bad guys you may recognize from other shows. Enjoy this show and all the seasons available!",Positive
I got this for my granddaughter. she loved it. she sat and watched it over and over and would get more of these videos the next time she visits.,Positive
"We were a little behind obviously, but very glad we found it on Amazon Prime.  Very interesting topics and you find yourself guessing if a person is lying now.",Positive
"""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" has a few of those awesome, special episodes that not only hit all the right notes, but actually go even further. One such episode is ""Soultaker,"" a clumsy supernatural thriller that seems like an 80s teenage version of ""Carnival of the Damned,"" only with teenagers and hair metal. And guess who make cameos!The Satellite of Love"" is malfunctioning badly, complete with Gypsy getting mean and transmissions of Martin van Buren (I never understood that one). Pearl is uninterested in saving Mike and the bots, so she simply sends them the movie ""Soultaker."" But a mysterious ship is flying alongside the Satellite, keeping them in a tractor beam. Who or what is saving Mike and the bots?As for the movie, it's about a bunch of teenagers driving home from a concert... festival... thing, and they get in a nasty car wreck after they see a man in black standing in the road. And as the man in black pursues them, two of the remaining teens discover that they are actually BRAIN-DEAD -- and their comatose bodies will be taken off life support at midnight.""Soultaker"" is not the worst movie that MST3K has done -- it's not even the worst amateur attempt at one by someone who has a ""great story"" to tell. It's theologically muddled, inconsistent and has a lot of plot holes (how do DEAD PEOPLE operate the elevator?), but it has some decent moments. It's awkward and clumsy, and that's what makes it bad.That is something you can't say about the Mike, Tom and Crow segments, which are perfect. These guys had snarking down to an art form, whether it's joking about the clumsy script (""But shes upper middle class and we're slightly lower middle!"") or the funny-looking actors (""It's a catcher's mitt with eyes!""). And of course, many jokes about Joe Estevez.And the hosting segments are also fun, with Mike struggling to command the Satellite, even as Gypsy insults him and Tom and Crow have a wet T-shirt contest. But those segments become AWESOME when a pair of familiar faces drop in for a visit... guess who!""Mystery Science Theater 3000: Soultaker"" is one of those must-see episodes of the classic snark series -- it's funny, strange, and has CAMEOS.",Positive
I was hooked after the first episode. Very good storyline and very believable.,Positive
"This show is amazing. My just turned 2 year old loooves it. He has learned his shapes from this! He also loves to ""measure"" everything (our dogs just looove that...). He has all the toys and books they have made for it so far. Waiting on more! Hint hint! He sleeps with the dolls, plays all day with the figures and love to color in the coloring book. Keep it coming!",Positive
"This show is funny, but I feel it could be funnier. The characters are pretty funny, but not much different than characters we may have seen before on film and television comedies. I think this show may benefit from gaining a full series run just to allow the characters to flesh out a little more.",Negative
"I stiil enjoy the plot lines ,actors. If you what too many episodes, the story lines become repetetive. That's why I took a break.",Positive
"While we know this is a knockoff of the X-Men and the Alphas are like mutants, the writers do a good job of creating an interesting story week to week. Can't wait for Season 2",Positive
One of the better small-town 19th century dramas which BBC has produced. It is akin to Downton Abbey though looking at a whole village rather than one family.,Positive
The stories are always engaging and the era ( WWII) interests me..Foyles driver brings unique point of view to the story line.,Positive
This an interesting show with great scenic views of Ireland.  It deals with mature subject matter butdoes so without resorting to profanity and graphic scenes.,Positive
"...and can't wait for it to return!  This is one of those shows that I wish I could just wait for the season to be over so I could &#34;consume it&#34; all at once, but alas, I find I cannot wait...as soon as I get a show, I have to watch it!",Positive
"Hi All,Excellent show, cannot wait for season three. Interesting basis on traveling back in time to stop bad things from happening all the while trying not to damage the future timeline your trying to get back to.Joe",Positive
"this reminded me of old time horror flicks. The fact that much of the film wasn't in English actually added to the spook factor for me. It made the ending that much more interesting when you realize how much you've misjudged the people in this film. Liked it a lot.A surprising gem from IFC. Here comes along an independent film that I've never heard of, I take a little risk and rent it, and then...WOW. Creepy, smart, great twist at the end that really caught me by surprise.This film is a MUST for any fan of the Horror / Supernatural genre.P.SI bought it on DVD because real liked it ..just wish they release it on blu-ray & widscreen format,This movie is great! i dont understand why people are talking about how they are speaking polish and there is no subtitles... Obviously it is for a reason they dont want you to know what the ending is going to be... i highly reccommend this movie!!!",Positive
"Lots of fun if you don't over think it. VTOL Globemaster and vintage Corvette are clever and implausible. The show is imaginative, inventive, and irascible. It has a bit of growing to do, but the characters are engaging enough.",Positive
Awesome show.  Hope they continue to follow the comic book.  Would like to see a team up with another super hero down the road.,Positive
I like crime stories but I love the British crime stories especially.  There are no really overplayed action parts with guns and 40 people shooting each other.  This is more sleuthing and detective work.  I have watched all 6 seasons of Inspector Lewis and I enjoyed every one.,Positive
I am in a restaurant with a drunk friend yelling Lana every 5 seconds so I was compelled to figure out what he was tripping on.  And yes I binged the entire series for some strange reason.  Good show length.  Google the live actors for more fun watching.,Negative
"The Closer was my favorite show, so I was glad to see it didn't completely go away.  While I don't find Major Crimes to be up to the standards of The Closer, it seems as though it is beginning to hit its stride.

Still have't got into all the new character's so that is why the 4 stars and not my normal 5. but has great newplot so far.,Positive
"When Only God Forgives was announced, I was stoked.  Drive was my favorite film of 2011, and the re-teaming of Refn and Ryan Gosling...I mean, how could you go wrong?  The original plot was listed as:A Bangkok police lieutenant and a gangster settle their differences in a Thai-boxing match.However, that must have changed.  That's only a few minutes of the film.  The actual plot has nothing to do with that.  The synopsis should have read:A drug dealer's mother hunts down the men that killed her son.This film is available in VERY select theaters or on VOD right now at home.  I went the at home route, as it was not playing anywhere near me.So...did I like it?This film is very hard to explain.  It's very avant-garde, and very 'old Kubrick'.  It's almost all visual, with little dialogue to support it.  All in all, Ryan Gosling only says about fifteen lines of dialogue.  That being said, the visuals are amazing.  Cliff Martinez does an amazing job creating a very unique look in Thailand...lots of contrasting reds and blues.  The score also stands out as swooning synths back the scenes not set to Karaoke music...and there are a few of those.The characters in this film (aside from the police lieutenant) are all unlikable.  There are various levels of filth, from Gosling's 'impotent watcher' to pedophiles, to sadistic mothers.  The lieutenant does leave an impression as a justice seeking machine, with little conscience.  I cannot say much more about the characters without spoiling things, so I won't.  The plot is very thin.  It's basically a standard revenge story.  The violence is sporadic but fierce.  There's a torture scene in here that is definitely not for the squeamish.The acting is serviceable.  Gosling is withdrawn and blank.  Most of his acting in this movie consists of errant stares.  Kristen Scott Thomas does a pretty good job as a mix of Courtney Love meets Lucille Bluth in a sadistic mother role.  Vithaya Pansringarm is fantastic as Chang.A lot of people are going to hate this film.  Gosling is even more withdrawn than he was in Drive, and Refn is in full on art house mode here.  This is for fans of Drive and even more so, Valhalla Rising.  If you didn't like those, you'll hate Only God Forgives.  Dave Chen from /Film described the film as 'Ryan Gosling walking down red hallways, fingering people'.  Not everyone is going to 'get' this one.I did not hate it.  I also did not like it right away, but the more I thought about it afterwards, the more I did like it.  It left an impression on me.  It's a beautifully crafted film, and I would definitely watch it again.Final Score: 3/5",Negative
"Big Bang Theory really seems to have found a formula that works.  The show has great pacing and some excellent humor.  The characters and their relationships change just enough each episode to keep us interested in them and in following the course of the show.  Season 7 is no different.  This is another great entry in a great series, and is definitely worth picking up if you are a fan of the series.",Positive
"I love this saga, it is better than reading a deliciously evil novel. The acting is superb, the plot fantastic I hang on every episode waiting for the next. Better than Downton Abbey which I also love.",Positive
"I watched all of the pilots for the Amazon shows, and this is the only one that really grabbed me. I definitely want to watch more of this show. I think the main reason is that I actually like (or want to like) the characters. It starts out a little clunky, but I quickly got used to them and already I'm attached. The plot itself is interesting (kids trying to make it big in Silicon Valley by developing software) and should be a good backdrop against which to explore the characters. The cast is pretty solid and the writing was interesting--I was actually watching to see what happened, and I was engaged, too. It's refreshing to see that from a TV show. I'm not sure what a series would look like, but I'm confident they could get a good season out of it without it getting stale.I definitely liked this show, and I really hope it goes to series.",Positive
"This is the kind of series I love. Mystery and Sci-Fi. Well acted and produced. Had I seen it, when it aired, I would haveBeen hooked. But like so many good shows, only saw one season. I think the story line, was a difficult one to continue.Definitely a great binge series.I don't think you will be disappointed, watching this show.",Positive
"My fascination with the city of Dallas began way before I moved to the suburbs of the most famous metropolitan areas in Texas. It started when I was around eight years old and I witnessed the shooting of J.R. Ewing on prime time television. At that age, I probably shouldn't have been watching a night-time soap opera full of boozing, brawling, and bed-hopping the likes that no American had seen before.Regardless of whether or not my young eyes should have witnessed the carnage occurring on &#34;Dallas,&#34; the show made a lasting impact on me that I still hold dear some thirty-four years later. There aren't many things I'm as passionate about as I am of the long-running television epic. My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary by attending a &#34;Dallas&#34;-themed murder mystery dinner party at the South Fork Hotel following a tour of the famous ranch. While there, we stuck our feet in the pool that caught Kristin Shepard's dead body after her fall from J.R.'s balcony.Needless to say, when it was announced that a new &#34;Dallas&#34; series was being launched, my wife and I were ecstatic. My excitement grew as I was invited to interview the entire cast at a Red Carpet Event for the first episode of the new show. I had interviewed Larry Hagman years before on the couch in the living room of South Fork and could never turn down the chance to talk to him and the rest of the cast again.You can only imagine my shock when I heard about the death of Hagman a couple of years back. It was a sad loss for me and millions of other fans of &#34;Dallas.&#34; I was personally affected from meeting the charming actor and continue to feel blessed to have been in his presence on a few occasions.Thanks to Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, all of us addicts can now re-watch J.R.'s final hours in the spotlight. &#34;Dallas: The Complete Second Season&#34; hits DVD on the eve of the premiere of the show's third season. All fifteen episodes are featured on four discs, including an extended cut of Larry Hagman's final episode entitled &#34;J.R.'s Masterpiece.&#34;&#34;Dallas: The Complete Second Season&#34; continues the fast-pace and complex storylines began in the freshman year of the relaunched series. J.R., Bobby, and Sue Ellen continue to get entangled in the webs weaved by their offspring, John Ross and Christopher. The two cousins are definitely their father's sons and can't help but clash with each other over who's the rightful heir to the Ewing Dynasty.&#34;Dallas: The Complete Second Season&#34; comes with a Texas-sized batch of bonus material. They feature &#34;'Dallas:' Fashion Files,&#34; &#34;'Dallas' at PaleyFest 2013,&#34; and optional commentary for &#34;J.R.'s Masterpiece.&#34; We also get all new featurettes including &#34;The Battle for Ewing Energies: Blood is Thicker than Oil,&#34; &#34;Memories of Larry Hagman: A Cast Tribute,&#34; and &#34;One Last Conversation with Larry Hagman.&#34;Although many people might think that the show would slow down and lose steam after J.R.'s death, it continues to chug along with a very evident mission. Show producers and the cast want to prove that &#34;Dallas&#34; can go on without Hagman, but with reverence and respect for the late actor. That's exactly what they did with the final episodes of &#34;Dallas: The Complete Second Season.&#34; As is evident on this DVD collection, it sizzled and left viewers begging for more every time the credits rolled on an episode.",Positive
"This is one of the best ""paranormal"" films I've seen.  You know along the lines of all the others (and there are many), this one had a story and decent jump factor, eerie and frightening.

This was probably the best season so far. Luckily I saw 200 & 201 when they were aired on TV (censored of course) but the fact that they are censored on DVD is complete BULL****!!!! I can't believe that Comedy Central released this DVD and still censored it.Usually I buy the seasons so I can watch them without commercials and UNCENSORED but I'm content with watching this season online for FREE. I returned this DVD to the store the next day. Comedy Central doesn't need my money anymore.,Negative
"CENTURION is not really a history lesson. It is however great entertainment. The photography  is breathtaking and on blu-ray one of the best in picture quality I have seen so far.The often mentioned ""logical errors"" I can live with. This is more of an action movie anyway and there's a lot of very bloody action in it, well deserving the R rating.Great and well-paced direction by Neil Marshall (Doomsday, The Descent) this is in my opinion his best work so far.All of the cast (mainly British actors since this is a British production) are excellent in their roles, Michael Fassbender as always, is outstanding, but the best performance is by Olga Kurylenko, who plays the mute pict scout Etain. Playing a character without dialogue can be very difficult, but she is totally believable every second she is on screen.The director thanks Walter Hill in the end credits, a nod to THE WARRIORS which has some similarities to the story.",Positive
"This show COULD be great if more time was spent with amazing actors like Gael Garcia Bernal (LOVE seeing him in a series!) and Malcolm McDowell. But too quickly it went off into an annoying copy of HBO's Girls if they played instruments with that look-at-me-being-so-cool- and -artsy- in- my- NY- apartment- no- one- in- their- twenties- could- afford style. I see that there are some really great Wes Anderson folks behind the scenes on this so I would expect something more original.

"This Australian film was written and directed by Jonathan Teplitzky and starring Matthew Goode.The film begins with a shot of Goode's agonizing face trying to get an erection while a topless woman looked on.The next scene shows Goode working in a restaurant kitchen barking orders.That scene jumps to Goode driving reckless in traffic and got hit by another car in slow motion and lost a lot of blood.Then the scene jumps back to the restaurant while Goode did all kinds of unthinkable things to a cooked duck just becausea customer wanted it more well-done.Afterwards we were introduced to Goode' ex(?)-wife and child then Goode destroyed a picnic just because a rugby player bumpedinto him.  Then someone was in the hospital(dying?) and tears were shed.I must admit that there were so many jump cuts from the 1st 30 mins that I could have missed mentioning some scenes and notremembered them in correct orders.What bothered me was not watching a man with all sorts of offensive behavior.  There were a lot in the movies.It was the annoying non-linear filming style of Jonathan Teplitzy that offended me.My question for Mr. Teplitzy is why can't he tell his story in straightforward format or not so recklessly non-linear?Filmmakers must understand that they are making films for the people who watch their films.Films are unlike novels which the creator can take some liberty in the narrative.Using non-linear filming style must have its justifications.The manner and style that Mr. Teplitzy used for this film are pretentious and maddening to say the least,and with that annoying piano soundtrack added to the fury.I could only endure 30 mins of this film and watched another DVD instead.I do not set high standards for watching movies and seldom do not watch them till the end.",Negative

"Child's Play (Sidney Lumet, 1972)It is exactly thirty-eight minutes into Child's Play where the movie stops being a fuzzy, slow-moving mess and becomes something that actually seems like a Sidney Lumet film. The scene takes place in the chapel of the boys' school where the entire film is set. Robert Preston (The Music Man), who plays Joe Dobbs, the headmaster of the eleventh-grade class, an English teacher much-beloved of the school's pupils, is standing at the front of the chapel, facing the altar. In a pew a few rows behind him is Jerome Malley (A Touch of Larceny's James Mason), the headmaster of the senior class, who teaches Greek and Latin and, as a holdover from the days when corporal punishment was accepted in schools, still has the nickname ""Lash"". Dobbs delivers a monologue that sets up the entire rest of the film, at least the bits that haven't already been set up. And I can almost imagine Lumet, at the end of that scene, smacking his fist into his other palm, pointing at Mason and Beau Bridges, the other main actor in this movie, then pointing to Preston and yelling, ""THAT is the quality of acting I want to see from you idiots!""He gets it for the rest of the film.Plot: We open with Paul Reis (Bridges) as a senior at the school, on his way to see the headmaster, Father Mozian (They Might Be Giants' Ron Weyand), for the very, very serious infraction of drawing some obscene pictures on Malley's chalkboard. He's being escorted by freshman teacher Dobbs, who cautions young Reis that, while such actions may be amusing, they're not likely to get him anywhere in life. The camaraderie of the moment is shattered by one of the school's jocks lobbing a basketball at Reis' head--it would seem that Reis is what Jean Shepherd calls ""one of the nameless rabble of victims"" in A Christmas Story. Dobbs defuses the situation and everyone gets on with their lives. Fast-forward nine years. Reis is now a phys.ed. teacher who's sick of the public school system and has returned to his alma mater to take up a vacant position there. He and Dobbs pick up just where they left off, as great friends. Reis seems willing to bury the hatchet with Malley, but Malley is driven to distraction by his mother's imminent death, which he believes is being hastened by a series of anonymous, harrassing phone calls, and assaults on his own character (which include, but are not limited to, pornographic magazines being ordered in his name and sent to his home, as well as notes being passed by the students--it is never explicitly stated, but made obvious nonetheless, that all of this is homosexual in nature). We find out soon enough that Malley was supposed to retire at the beginning of the year, but refuses to do so because he is adamant that Dobbs not take over his job as senior headmaster; he considers the affable Dobbs not only unfit for the job, but in fact an agent of Satan himself (he believes Dobbs to be behind all the magazines, notes, calls, etc.). Reis walks into the middle of this, and while he's not explicitly tasked with choosing a side, his unexpected, and unlikely, ally Father Penny (King of the Gypsies' David Rounds in his first feature appearance), the oft-tipsy religion teacher, warns Reis that it's going to happen eventually, no matter how neutral he tries to stay. While this is the main conflict, there's also the ever-present bullying that, as we know, Reis is all too familiar with...but this class aren't just bullies, they're sadists; in the first act of bullying to which Reis is witness, by the time he manages to pull the children off, their target has damage severe enough that the hospital believes he may lose an eye. A second victim is mock-crucified, at which point Father Mozian is forced into considering whether to expel the culprits--which would, almost immediately, cause the school to shut down, as they comprise half the senior class (and thus, half the senior class' tuition). Assuming, of course, the authorities don't shutter it first.There is a great deal going on here, and the late Lumet manages to herd these cats very nicely once the movie finds its rhythm (which, admittedly, takes thirty-eight minutes). Mason, Preston, and Bridges, of course, were all known commodities by this time, and was there ever any question they were up to the material? As a simple portrait of the nasty goings-on at a boys' school, a generic slice-of-life drama, this would have been a damned good movie. But the final twenty minutes, which turn it into something very different indeed, take it from ""good"" to ""blow the lid off."" In the hands of a lesser director, or performed by lesser actors (and to be fair, there's a time or two where it seems like Bridges is about to slip over the line), this could have come off cheesy, if not unintentionally hilarious. But it is meant to be horrific, and it succeeds. This is tragedy of Greek proportions, with the school's gang of bullies functioning as the chorus of harridans, and had the first thirty-eight minutes been as taut and compelling as the final hour, this would be Lumet's second five-star film in my library (Dog Day Afternoon is the other). Even with that considered, this is another guaranteed slot in the top thousand for Mr. Lumet; the brilliance of the last sixty-two minutes downright overwhelms the unfocused, muzzy quality of the first thirty-eight. **** ",Positive
Another great television fire series I like the cast and I think acting is great. I think it's better than rescue Me. And I also like the way the show combines with Chicago PD. I hope that they get a number of seasons out of this one.,Positive
"Satire and senseless violence I love.  I tolerate the pot culture and the sexual references.  The language is what made me almost drop the episode.Meta explaining the work-in-progress through stop motion and drawing boards is pretty classic.It's got promise.  I would have given it 5 stars and watch the season if I got a PG version.  I'd even settle for a safe PG13/TV14 territory, but it's pushing the envelope even there.",Negative
I gave it 4 stars because of the quality of the story. Acting and plot are very good and will keep you guessing.,Positive
"John Cleese does a great job portraying the owner of this struggling inn. He is hen-pecked, frustrated, and has a short fuse. His domineering an dismissive wife orders him about, and pours sarcastic criticism when he fails to do as she bids. He hires the wrong workers, whether staff or contractors, and the results are hilarious. His waiter, Manuel, plays the part of a Spanish man struggling to learn English while attempting to serve his master well. The misunderstandings due to the language barrier abound, producing many hilarious moments. If want some good laughs, check this series of shows out!",Positive
"I am not a fan of zombie movies, but I do like post apocalyptic story lines. The characterization, however; won me over. This is certainly more about the Human experience, than the Zombie experience. The writers took a big risk in the development of this season.  I for one like to see what is happening to all members of the cast in one episode. I have seen this method of separation work before. I am anxious to see the further development.",Positive
Same B-Day now that is a good twist on the matter. I just wonder what will the rest be like.,Positive
"I had a lot of trouble just making out the dialogue either because of the audio quality, the particular British accents the actors adopted, and/or my own aging ears, but on the other hand, what's going on is pretty self-evident.  Two former military buddies get together to collaborate on working as professional hitmen because they need the money and one of them has to live down a botched job in Kiev.  He brutally kills a number of allegedly bad people as if to make up for his previous slip-up, until the two of them run into a bit of a pickle in the end (to say the least).  In between all the blood and guts spilled, the men act like normal if a bit neurotic blokes, one of them with an unbelievably loyal wife and kid and the other with an attractive but mysterious girlfriend with an apparent penchant for witchery of the black kind.It's not the kind of film that I normally watch because of the gore and violence level, but it features excellent acting, very effective background music, and sickeningly realistic special effects.  It's kind of like a Quentin Tarantino film on steroids. I wouldn't recommend it except to those with a strong stomach, so I'm only giving it three stars.",Negative

"Looking for a film that features mass suicide, demons, evil omen fetuses, zombies, cults, poltergeists, possession, aliens and disfigured murderers?  Well, depending my interpretation of what I saw in the melee of clips from this film you may be in for all that and more...all be it in small doses.  We get to taste a lot of stories and ideas and, if we don't like one of the shorts after ten minutes, just wait ten more minutes for the next one to start.  If you like anthologies then don't miss this.Episodic horror anthology meets found footage as the movie opens with a private investigator's footage (taken by his assistant).  They make their way into a home loaded with VHS tapes.  What's weirder than the lack of DVD upgrades are the other things they find in the house and its general semi-abandoned state.Anyway, clearly the assistant never saw The Ring because she happily starts watching the tapes one after the other, alone!  As she watches the videos, we watch the short films that comprise this episodic anthology.  Like many such episodic horror films, the introductory story (called Tape 49) additionally moves on briefly in between the shorts with interesting developments.These short films vary substantially in filming style, acting, gore, direction and writing quality.  The second and third films were much better than the other two ""tape"" films, both of which were so mundane I'd be happier if they were altogether omitted at the expense of the film's running time.  Below is a summary of each short film and, sometimes, a cheeky quote...Phase I Clinical Trials.  After an accident a man (Adam Wingard; not the best actor) receives a prototype prosthetic eye. A part of the compromise of this ""free"" clinical trial is that it has a built-in recording device that remains on at all times.  After getting home it appears that his recorder his short-circuiting on him because he starts to see blips of static, ghostly figures of dead people and general hallucinations.  It serves semi-moderately well as a jump-scare flick which is brief tactlessly smutty. Overall I was unimpressed with this play on The Eye (2002 Asia, 2008 USA remake) which failed more often than it succeeded in shocking viewers despite serial attempts.  Entertaining, I guess--but nothing special.  Filmmakers:  Directed by Adam Wingard (The ABCs of Death - Q is for Quack; V/H/S - Tape 56) and written by Simon Barrett (The ABCs of Death; V/H/S - The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger).A Ride in the Park.  A cyclist wearing a head-cam goes for a jaunt in the park, during which he encounters an injured woman in the process of succumbing to zombiism.  This is a straight-forward, blatantly predictable zombie short from the start, but it does a nice job illustrating the simplest domino-like cascading beginnings of a z-pocalypse with a pretty good sense of humor.  The special effects are generally weak but I appreciate a good gross-out attempt when I see one--and a few playful attempts are made complete with visceral sound editing.  Clever camerawork and good storytelling make this short film a strong success.  Filmmakers:  Directed by Gregg Hale (producer: Lovely Molly; Seventh Moon) and Eduardo S&aacute;nchez (director: Lovely Molly; Seventh Moon).Safe Haven.  This foreign horror short follows a film crew making a documentary of an Indonesian cult, led by ""Father"" who will lead them to immortality.  The crew gets Father's permission to film on his compound where we learn of some strange sexual conduct involving children. But our attention is quickly derailed as worst-case cultish scenarios play out before our eyes very quickly.  The gore is VERY, VERY, VERY abundant, VERY well-executed and VERY in our face!  This short becomes totally bonkers for all the right reasons and includes evil omen birth, animated evil corpses, demons, possessed behavior, mass suicide and exploding bodies.  Did I mention the fantabulous gore?  This is one of the best effects-driven shorts I've seen!  Although the effects of the major demon were admittedly pretty weak, all else was nothing short of stellar given their humble budget.  Filmmakers:  Directed by Timo Tjahjanto (The ABCs of Death - L is for Libido) and Gareth Evans (Merantau, The Raid: Redemption) did a pretty rockin' job with this.  I'd like to see a feature length version of this with more amped up creature effects/design and, obviously, more story development.Slumber Party Alien Abduction.  Shot in part via ""doggy-cam,"" this short film is about three siblings, their friends and their dog, and a sleepover.  After meeting the foul-mouthed, fun-loving kids their sleepover is invaded by annoyingly classic-looking aliens.  The creature concepts, invasion, chase scenes and scares were of the lowest level of cinema and offered us NOTHING.  I'm sure the filmmakers were trying to show us some clever style, but I found nothing of the sort; it just looks like a couple of simpletons made a dumb film that serves no other purpose than to warn would-be financiers away from supporting the director's future endeavors.  EXTREMELY BAD!  And I'm normally good at finding the kinder angles for recommending most any horror film.  Filmmakers:  Directed by Jason Eisener (The ABCs of Death - Y is for Youngbuck, Hobo with a Shotgun).Tape 49.  This is the story of the investigator and his assistant, who is watching the tapes as we, the audience, watch.  This was done well and closes with an amazing,  gory, intense, creeptastic finish.  I was happy with this anthology canvas.  Filmmakers: Simon Barrett (The ABCs of Death; V/H/S - The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger).Just because I disliked a couple of these shorts in no way means this wasn't a fun experience.  We get to taste a lot of stories and ideas and, if we don't like one of the shorts after ten minutes, we just wait ten more minutes for the next one to start.  If you like anthologies then don't miss this.",Positive

"The shows in England were a bit dry, awkward, and insecure.  But once they get to California it's off to the races.  This is intelligent, observant, subtle comedy.

You can watch it in order or just pick one of the last episodes at random.",Positive
"In all honesty, if I see one more cat jump out from behind a door, I'm going to shoot my television.  I just can't bring myself to understand why anyone, ANYONE, would think that that was a good idea.  As a film director, how can you justify building a suspenseful sequence around an animal of any sort, but especially a cat, making noise in a dark corner and then popping out just when you think you're about to see something really terrifying?  It's beyond my comprehension.That being said, a stupid scene like the one mentioned would not and should not be enough to entirely write off any horror film.  It happens so often in horror films that you'd basically have to write them all off.  What CAN cause you to write off a horror film would be the fact that it just isn't scary.  I'm struggling because I honestly can't decide whether or not this was supposed to be taken seriously.  Maybe this was supposed to be a comedy or a spoof, you know, like `Scary Movie', but I know that it's not and that makes me confused.  This has got to be one of the most unintentionally funny films I've ever seen.  Each scene looks like something out of a poorly crafted comedy.  It reminds me of when I saw `Darkness Falls' and I laughed throughout, which is not the reaction you want from a horror film.Clich&eacute;s abound in this messy film that centers on a haunted hotel that is going out of business.  The employees are obsessed with the rumors surrounding the ghost haunting the hotel and they do everything they can to stir stuff up.  God, none of this works.  The performances are so affected and mannered and just bad and the direction is completely uninspired.I've seen a lot of bad films this year, but this may be the worst.",Negative
"This was a surprisingly funny sitcom pilot.  The acting and writing were excellent.  The three main characters work well together and you feel they have known each other for years. The production appeared to be on a budget but it gave it a midwestern, &#34;not sure of exactly what year it is&#34; feel.  Kudos to Amazon.",Positive
You think you know what they have in Fort Knox? Do you think congress of the President knows for sure? Would you be surprised to find out that the builder and designer of the faces on Mount Rushmore  had a political agenda that many Americas would not embrace? There is part of the White House that is missing and no one knows where it is. Not even the president? Secret and mystery out in plain site..,Positive
"After the first series of pilots I was not expecting a whole lot out of this season.  To be honest this was the first one that I watched and WOW, what a concept.  I really enjoyed the music as well as the idea of a behind the scene look at the up and coming performers as they begin.If this gets called up for production it is a show that I would watch with no reservations and the casting is amazing.",Positive
Interesting story line.  More a story about survival than a senseless zombie flick.  The type of series that makes you think &#34;what if???&#34;,Positive
"While the plot bogged down with complications at times, they pulled it out at the end. The cast and music were wonderful as was the dancing. Fans of musicals will love Smash!",Positive
I enjoyed the pilot. Liked the lead actor and hope to see more of the shows. I thought the look of the show gritty and using the city as a character in the plot a good choice.,Positive
"The Angels and Demons showdown with Lillith and the female demon that tricked Sam was over the top amazing!  And once that battle was done, I was expecting an entirely new legend to spring up for Sam and Dean.  But here we are Season 9 and the show is still stuck on demons and angels.Good grief Supernatural writers, please find some new material for the show!  And how many more times will Dean and Sam go their separate ways, only to come back together with so much tension between them it hurts?Dean is no longer the fun brother, he might as well be a female with how much he whines and complains about every freakin' thing in every scene!And Sam, well...LOL...Sam is still deliciously the man of my dreams. I kid you not, that man (his character) has gotten sexier with every show.  He's the reason I force myself to watch the show still.As the show has gone on Sam's compassion, patience, and understanding towards the monsters he may kill makes that character so much more appealing.  He doesn't see a creature and automatically want to kill it.  He does try and base his actions against the actions of the creature.Dean on the other hand is, if it ain't human...kill it!  For me, that attitude loses any appeal he may have had in the beginning of the show.  It may be time for the duo to add a creature to their team.  Ever since, I think his name was Bobby (the older man that helped them out) left, it feels as though something is missing in the show.If only the writers could think outside the box and create a serial killer on the show that's so unique it takes an entire season avoiding any topics about angels or demons.Wishing on a star!!",Negative
"I love the show and my son loves it even more. It is very good at teaching him information about animals, bugs, plants, and the Earth in general. I always watch the show with him to make sure there is nothing I disagree with...mainly evolutionary problems. For the most part I haven't had any major conflicts. I am Christian and do not believe in Darwin's theory of Evolution. It is true some &#34;micro-evolution&#34; has occurred ...particularly with plants but the idea we have all come from slime or monkey's is not something I believe.",Positive
Pilot seemed a bit banal in the plot line; characters were somewhat engaging and they may improve over time.  I am willing to watch a couple more episodes to see what happens,Negative
"Betas has an interesting premise, but is bogged down with too much sophomoric humor and a lack of a sense of a long-term relationship between the characters. Maybe working out the back-story of each character would help the actors have a better sense of character relationships. The acting did not feel like the characters knew each other.I would like to see more dry humor and wit added to the comedy; these are suppose to be smart people, right? Then write them that way. Only the lead had some smart dialog but even that failed because of the way the others interacted with him. It just came across as dry. A bit of wit from the others would have spiced things up. They could anticipate his pep-talks and break in with witty comments or finish his sentence for him with a twist.There was a failure to really engage the audience. The writers and actors need to dig deeper and give us something from the soul. The pilot had good moments, like when the guys saw the ""Valet Me"" company celebrating at the restaurant. The bar scene with the woman in charge of investment advice needs to be better. The viewer needs to come away knowing how much the guys need her. It was only almost. The connection between her and the lead of the software group was interesting, but needs to have more of a sense of potential from the beginning. I liked her dry humor toward him, but a witty interchange that engaged the two of them (great minds, who are opposites, meet,)and us as voyeurs, would be fantastic. (See the final ""Elementary"" episode, when Sherlock meets Irene.) That is how it is done, folks!I also think a better title could help the series. Something like a texting alphabet soup or a proffer reference.Talk to people in the business. My daughter is a database architect and tells funnier stories than those in the pilot. For example: she once texted a VP during a meeting. ""Shut this guy up or we will be here past lunch. Ask yourself, have we found the problem? He is just trying to sound important. I think the little programmer from India has the information we need."" The guy looked confused to be texted by someone at the table, he did a double take and looked down at my daughter. Then read for a few minutes and finally stood up took charge and asked to hear from the other people.",Negative
"If it isn't, it's pretty darn close. Supernatural just gets better and better with each passing season. I just watched the third episode of season four last night on TV and it looks like the current season is heading in the right direction. This is the only great show the CW has ever produced. Most people make fun of the network, but I bet they haven't watched this show. It has good acting (the two leads are very likeable), clever and often funny writing, very good special effects, a classic rock soundtrack and a well thought out storyline. Not to mention all the different hot babes that pop up almost every week.Supernatural gets a lot of involvement from the writers and directors of the The X-Files and it shows in it's quality. If your a horror and action fan like me, you won't find any show on TV better than this. Okay, maybe Dexter, but that's more thriller than horror.",Positive
Very funny in its own offbeat way. We enjoyed it far more than we expected. Weren't too sure what to expect since no one in the group had heard of it but turned out to be very enjoyable. Recommend it.,Positive

"I LOVE that they put Jack (from Bones) in this weeks show! This one was the best yet, great location changes & very entertaining plot! I also really enjoy Willas story, you can tell that she is in love with Timo so I really hope that works out for her in the end, with a lot of cute gypsy love drama in between. As for the show as a whole, its getting better all the time, I have very high hopes for The Finder!",Positive
"I started watching this series, so I had to finish the season.  The show has been cancelled now.  Probably because it was a little farfetched.",Negative
I don't know how they got such a good cast of characters but they did.I will miss the program.  Mary and Marshall Marshall were the best.,Positive
"Have to say I really liked the other 4 new ""pilots"" but this one is just not worth watching. I loved Oz, Shameless (BBC), Prison Break, the Sopranos and a host of other similar shows who certainly had some unpleasant characters but THOSE people were interesting and well written. Transparent has none of that. I do not understand the high reviews. For example: the family is sitting at a table and eating barbecue ribs. Each one of them has their face and hands liberally smeared with goopy barbecue sauce, as they chow down on the ribs.. One fellow has a beard with sauce all up in his beard. Nobody feels like they need to wipe. This is supposed to be funny.The best that can be said about it is that Transparent is boring. With a lot of 4 letter words.",Negative
"There are two questions one has to propose after watching an overwrought parable of a film like ""I Melt With You."" Is the movie any good? And is it worth watching? I know some who feel these answers are always the same, but I don't. If someone asked me if Mark Pellington's outrageous examination of middle-aged regret was good, I'd have to say no. So over-the-top and patently ridiculous, the movie is an absolute mess tonally and thematically (even to the point of morphing into a thriller for its conclusion). But is it worth watching? There's something to be said about the absolute madness of it all that makes ""I Melt With You"" sickly fascinating. Even as I was laughing at how inept the story line felt, the movie kept pushing into greater and greater outrageousness. And I must admit, there is an odd entertainment factor to be gleaned from this unpredictability. While it may not be a ""good"" movie, it patently refuses to back down and play it safe. I respect that as well. My rating, therefore, is divided. I give it one star on merit and three stars for its bold commitment to lunacy. Overall, I'll make it two stars and predict that this is the love-it or hate-it proposition of the season.The movie introduces four childhood friends who get together once a year for a week of insane debauchery. Without much preamble or development, we meet the guys briefly in their everyday lives before they assemble at an isolated chalet. Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay play the quartet and it's clear that, as a whole, they've been a pretty privileged bunch. But looks can be deceiving, or so the screenplay would have you believe. Each man is haunted by regret and the life not chosen. Despite being successful professionals (some with families), the trip instantly devolves into a drug-fueled music video of bad acts and excess. The movie, in these early scenes, has so little plot momentum that it seems a repetitive (and rather silly) glorification of poor choices and a complete disconnection with recognizable humanity. As each man faces his supposed demons and idealizes a more innocent time, the movie slows down to hear their hard luck stories. But one tragedy and a childhood promise will forever change these men. I won't reveal any more than that, other than to say that the movie just gets systematically more loony as it progresses.With pulsing music, disjointed camera work, and absolute hysterics, the movie becomes a preposterous thriller. To their credit, the actors never waver and all serve up deliciously over-the-top interpretations of ""real"" people. I know some will consider the subject matter provocative and thought-provoking, but it's so far out there--you can't take any of it seriously. But by the time the film enters its final 45 minutes (and the great Carla Gugino shows up), the movie has jumped a school of sharks (not just one) to enter bad movie nirvana. It's so bad, it's good! I'm not sure how anyone would get deep meaning out of ""I Melt With You,"" although its central premise is sound enough. If you do, however, good on you! For me, it's a master class of excess that takes itself way too seriously and thus becomes an absolute treat for lovers of bad movie mayhem. Without the slow start, maybe I'd have rated this higher for the delirium! As is, though, I hated it AND loved it (but for all the wrong reasons), yet am hard pressed to actually recommend it. Despite those that will proclaim it some sort of modern masterpiece, there's a reason its critical consensus on Metacritic is 26 out of 100. KGHarris, 8/12.",Negative
"So, spoiler alert, some new cast members. I wasn't sure I was going to like it but ended up having some rousing fun. Was it like the first 2 seasons? No. The first 2 seasons had a really tight-knit crew with very human dynamics. You were always kept on edge not only by the actual animals from the anomalies but also from trying to figure out what the spin was between the characters. Now, with a different leader on the crew, the dynamics really changed. I found myself laughing at some of the outrageous actions taking place. Yes, some laughing at the absolute impossibility of the situation in which they found themselves (read as &#34;ridiculous, foolish, unbelievable, what were they thinking?) But, also, some really good laughs involving the dynamics of the crew and other characters. In this case, I really had a rip-roaring good time- Danny is a complete smart-mouth and has a major attitude problem with authority, which he makes no attempt to hide. This season is really more of an action-adventure than the last 2 seasons. Still, I recommend the entire season- call me a junkie for Primeval!",Positive

"This is one of those movies that just doesn't go and or do anything.  It just lies there, dormant and motionless until the credits roll and your eyes readjust to the light.  What is sad is that there is so much potential within the prose, and even the approach (restraint as opposed to abrasiveness) is welcomed and yet falls so flat it becomes tiresome.  The base plot feels almost silly, never really feeling like a genuine plot and more or less like a child's short story taken over by a screenwriter attempting to make it more adult themed.  The characters are skeletons, the revelations are minute and the overall impact is barely a scratch.  Dafoe sleeps through his performance and builds no depth between his character's motivations and his eventual arc, but at least Sam Neill and Frances O'Connor (she needs more roles) offer up some great supporting performances that actually build a backstory.  At the end of the day, two sharp performances and some beautiful scenery cannot a good film make.  This bore of a tale never fully gets off the ground, despite many attempts to do so.  I understand that this is a more internalized film, but there never seems to be enough reason to care much for what is unfolding.  At the end of the day, it says very little.  If you want an internalized look at a life of regret and personal upheaval, check out 2010's `The American'.  This film tries to mirror the approach, but fails to nail it in any way.",Negative

"I am really not a fan of conspiracy theories and I generally try to avoid documentaries like this one, but The flight 800 crash did happen within a half hour of my home. For six months after the crash the local media was filled with arguments and doubt over what happened. Now, 17 years removed, I decided to watch this film, with the hope of finally learning the truth and I think I did. When a handful of people see something, it's easy to pass them over as a bunch of nuts, but what happens when 1000 people see something? The First Amendment gives people the right to say anything, but when you're going against the U.S. Government, you'd better have the evidence to back it up, the producers of this film have that and then some. In this film, the lead NTSB investigator, on the job for more the 40 years said that the FBI was on the scene in minutes, that they wouldn't let anyone in, and once he was finally allowed to do his job, evidence was removed and he was not allowed to submit his report. Medical examiners, on the job for half a century explained that their investigation was hindered as well, and that the injuries didn't fit the story. The film makers not only had this outrageous testimony, but they had experts who said the Government story was impossible. They prove this with formerly classified documents, radar evidence, and witness testimony. There is no doubt that this plane was brought down by missiles, so why did the Government cover it up? If it was an act of terrorism, there would be no reason to cover it up. Not to mention, if it was an act of terrorism, how did they get three missles and two boats, without anyone noticing? Finally, most compelling of all, when a terrorist group does something, they want everyone to know about it, but no one ever took responsibility for doing this, which leads me to believe it was our own Government. There is a naval base in that area, who would have had the capabilities of doing this, the only question is, did the U.S. Government sacrifice 149 people to kill one person who they didn't want leaving the country? I don't know and neither does anyone else, but the truth is that the families of the victims deserve to know how and why their loved ones were killed. How can anyone expect to have closure when their is such an obviously lie being thrown at them? It really is a shameful display of Government abuse and all I can say is that I hope the real story does come out one day.",Positive

"This is a pretty realistic view of what would happen during a nuclear war.  I do believe people would come together and help each other.  That being said, communities would come together like they did in Jericho and would help each other, until the food ran out.  After that it would be every person for themselves.  Luckily we don't have to see that.  What we do see is what would happen after a  nuclear exchange.  Modern things stop working, food stops arriving and people that get common injuries and colds all of a sudden become life threatening events.  I like the stories, I like the characters.

There is definitely a need for this choice in tv viewing.However, as an adult, without kids, I find the scripts a little tedious.  I watched a couple of times because I am a big Jenna Elfman fan. Her talents are wasted here.  I would so love to see her in the right material where  all her sassy, witty swagger is showcased.  I hate to confess it but I am also somewhat put off by watching the blind dad stare blankly at the camera. And finally, J.K.

Veronica finds her way back to Neptune to help Logan and ends up not only finding herself in the midst of a case that could potentially clear Logan's name for the murder of his high profile girlfriend but a mystery of the murder from the past.  The movie lives up to the three seasons of the show that saw the series end to soon.  One of the many casualties that resulted from the network changing from UPN to the WB to The CW network (i,e. Star Trek: Enterprise).  Both Veronica Mars and Enterprise series didn't die out because of a lack of viewership but the confusion of the changes of the networks.

"The entire time I was watching the film, I had the feeling that half of it had ended up on the cutting room floor, leaving huge gaps in the script. The entire production felt rushed as we jumped from scene to scene, so I can't help but think the movie would have profited from an additional half an hour running time.Though the era is recreated fairly well,  more attention could have been paid to the spirit of the times--the sexual revolution and showing why Deep Throat was such a hit with mainstream audiences.Linda's character, a wide eyed innocent, remains the same until the final  minutes when we fast forward to the 1980's and the Donahue show. Peter Sarsgaard as Linda's sleazy husband does nothing that Eric Roberts didn't do better thirty years earlier in Star 80; James Franco is woefully miscast as High Hefner, while Azaria, Noth and Mazar are just about perfect in their roles--though lacking in depth and development.Amanda Seyfried is as cute as pie and charming but gave a much more powerful performance as the young call girl in Cloe while Sharon Stone is surprisingly good as Linda's  repressed, bitter and cold mother.I say, skip it, and see the marvelously well done Boogie Nights or Wonderland instead.",Negative

"Most of the issues I have with this movie have no bearing on the film itself, but with my problem understanding the Irish/Scottish fairy tales and certainly, the manner of speaking.  I should have turned on the subtitles but I'm not sure that would have helped.  I never heard of selkies for example.  In any case we are kept guessing until the final act.  The young woman (Ondine) turns up in a fisherman's nets.  Ondine is played by the stunning Alicja Bachleda.  It's hard to take your eyes off her.  The fisherman is played by Colin Farrell in one of his better roles.  The guy has acting chops.  The film does take a turn to the dark side eventually which takes away from the growing mystical romance that encompasses most of the movie.  I guess, director/writer Neil Jordan has to bring the film back to reality, but the thriller aspect seems a bit of a 180.  Still, I liked the movie and loved looking at Ms. Bachleda.",Positive
"A movie that defies both facile description and easy categorization - is it an anarchic comedy, a sci-fi thriller, an apocalyptic, end-times parody? - ""John Dies at the End"" plays like a bad acid-trip caught on film. The Don Coscarelli scenario, based on the novel by Don Wong, focuses on two buddies, Dave and John, who become unwittingly involved with time-tripping, mind-reading, astral projection and a whole host of creep crawly creatures after each is injected with a strange black liquid given to them by a Jamaican mentalist. But do David and John have what it takes to enter the trans-dimensional portal and save the world from the evil forces attempting to cross over from the other side?Don't fret if you can't make heads or tails out of this manic and amusing tribute to the surreal and the absurd; instead, just sit back and enjoy the ride as director Coscarelli hurls us from one bizarre experience to the next.

"Robin Williams is one of the funniest men to ever star on the silver-screen, but occasionally he does a weird dark comedy, that's very hit or miss. In World's Greatest Dad, Williams plays an English Teacher, who covers up his son's bizarre and embarrassing death. The suicide note he forged gets printed by the school newspaper, making his loser son, an overnight sensation. Williams is a great actor and gives credence to even a bad film like this, but even he can't save this one. The story is just ridiculous, his son (Daryl Sabara) was a complete nightmare that everyone wanted dead. No one would all of a sudden care, just because he wrote a heartfelt suicide note. It's also extremely unrealistic, since his son was as stupid as they come. That being said, with the exception of newcomer, Eric Martin, the rest of the supporting cast was awful, making the film that much more unrealistic. World's Greatest Dad may have landed it's star, but it's a sloppy movie, that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's an hour and a half of pure torture, with the occasional funny scene that's all Robin Williams. This is one film that just starts out slow, never gets going and is anything but the ""hilarious"", ""wonderful"" film that I was expecting.",Negative

The story line is like one very long novel and being able to watch episode after episode at your leisure with Prime is the perfect way to get the most from this story.  The novel celebrates those that strive to cling to positive moral values in the face of unimaginable hardships.",Positive

"If you enjoyed Season 1 of Hyacinth and her attempts to impress all her friends and acquaintances, then you will also enjoy Season 2.  Brother- in-law Onslow and sisters Daisy and Rose keep popping up just in time to overturn Hyacinth and Richard's dinner party plans or a visit to a nobleman' s estate. Neighbors, the milkman, and and the postman also try their best to avoid Hyacinth, but can't quite seem to sneak by her house without running into her and getting a lecture on having cleaner shoes, better milk bottles, finding lost mail, etc. Of course, having her 90 year old ""Daddy"" thinking he needs to protect the area from imaginary bomb attacks doesn't help Hyacinth in her quest to be the best hostess either. Enjoy another fun filled season!",Positive

"WATCH ALL 3 EPISODES BEFORE JUDGING! I'll admit, the pilot was broad and web-cammy, but funny and promising. Episode 2 was MUCH IMPROVED. Episode 3 was GREAT! What the pilot showed was just the exterior and the broad-strokes, but ep. 2 & 3 really started to flesh-out these characters. (*Possible Spoiler*) The anti-social problems, cultural background, and sexual identity of Nash in episode 3 alone is just great character development and it left wanting to learn more and more about these characters. I definitely recommend this series. Although, I (and possibly you) would think that Alpha House, with it's star-power would have been Amazon's winner, I'm starting to think Betas might be their champion series. Dear, Amazon...give me more!",Positive

"While I'm not quite to the point of asking, ""Brenda who?"" yet, this show had a feeling and a spark quite different from The Closer. With this episode, it feels like Major Crimes got a living breathing pulse of its own. It's a different feel although with highly familiar faces.Still, it wouldn't hurt to have one of the characters say at an appropriate time, ""Thank you. Thank you very much,"" with a darling southern drawl...[...][[...]",Positive
I accidentally bought the HD version and didn't notice any difference in quality from the standard version. Love this series and glad to be able to purchase it without having to wait for the next season to begin.,Positive
I have a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9&#34; and the picture quality for every show is excellent.  The show content is a little predictable and each episode is a little similar but it's fun entertainment anyway.  I enjoy seeing all the strange things that people bring in to try to sell.,Positive
"I loved this pilot.  I would never have thought of Titus Welliver for Bosch, but he really nails him!  I liked the way they made L.A. into a character, as it is in all his books.  They really got the essence of Bosch.  The jazz, the smoking, the sitting on his balcony looking out over the city, and his confidence in himself.  The story is suspenseful and well done, going back and forth from the shooting from 2 years ago he is on trial for now, and the case he is currently working now.  Welliver does a great job of showing Bosch's care and concern for his murder victims.  This one must get the green light to go ahead and become a series.",Positive
"This show is too addicting.  I watch at least one episode every night, ans sometimes I stay up until 5am watching this show.  I've learned so much watching this.  The most important thing is that everyone's story is different.",Positive
"I wrote the following about the pilot. ""This is a clever and fun show. Well shot, written, performed and directed. Looking forward to the season. It's a Royal Flush.""Then I watched the second episode. Oh dear, they lost me. They took something that could have been great and screwed it up. Sorry waaaaahhhh, The Dong went off so get off the stage....",Negative

I liked the first episode. Hopefully they'll make more. (A partial repeat of my previous but rejected review.  Rejected apparently because Amazon doesn't allow certain words like &#34;min*imum&#34; and &#34;co*unt&#34;.  Wow.),Positive
Thanks for the listing,Positive
"If you like watching stories of the paranormal this series is for you.  It's very entertaining and chalked full of lots of stories of the unexplained.  What does get me though are the EVP's (Electronic voice phenomena) that some of these folks pick up like &#34;Help Me&#34; or &#34;Am I dead?&#34;  If there is such a thing as our spirit's or souls somehow surviving after death, it would be sad to leave a lost soul like that without any help. Especially if that disembodied soul needs help stepping into the light as it were.",Positive
was suprising and cant wait to find out more information and see what happens with the rest of the story.,Positive
"Fun show to watch for quick laughs, it's not &#34; Under The Dome &#34; it's like a 30 Min. sitcom but some funny characters to say the least.",Positive
I used to really like Dual Survival but the new season with Joe Teti SUCKS.He maybe a great special ops man but Stinks at this just way to arrogant. mikyle Hawks would have been a better pick. Or better yet whatever the controversy is with Dave Canterbury(and yes we've all heard big deal) could have been overcome like the whole Bear Grills thing if someone at discovery hadn't freaked. AS is show is not worth watching anymore let alone buy.whole show is headed toward oblivion if discovery doesn't do something fast.And that would be a sad loss.,Negative
"Love the show, always have.  Wish they'd put more seasons on Prime.  This season has a couple of annoying players, but still a great watch!",Positive
I love this show. The chemistry between the characters is wonderful.  I would like to believe certain objects posses powers or properties. The story lines are terrific.,Positive
"When I began watching this series I knew that one season was not going to be enough for me. I am half way through and am entertained, interested, and anxious to find out what happens next. Coping with war, death and living the best way that they can is a lesson in the human spirit.",Positive
This is one of the best period pieces I have seen.  Colin Firth kills it in his porttrayal of Mr Darcy.  It it touching and heart wrenching.  Loved it.,Positive
"I loved the show and while the visual quality was good, it did not seem like HD to me. I doubt that I would be able to tell the difference between the HD and standard options.",Positive

"The league is a extra funny show. Even if you don't like sports, or football, you can't go wrong with all the laughs this show offers. I really enjoy it and would suggest you check it out for yourself.",Positive
The writing in this season is amazingly well done. As is the acting. The character actors playing the bad guys and the heroes accompanying the Doctor are top notch.,Positive
I enjoy these types of programs.Josh Gates it a fearless host and the show is produced well.Worth the price.,Positive
"Okay storyline, but it would probably have to get rewritten several times before it would be ready for the actual big screen.  A bit clunky overall, but I feel like other studios have released worse in the past.",Negative
"Naturally you have to watch the rest of the series for this one to rank, but it most certainly does and is worthy of your time.",Positive
Just when I thought they were all dead. Jack returns like never before and BAM!!!Did Cloe ever look different; she is kind of way out there.Next episodes should be the determining factor if the renewed series will make it or not.,Positive
I liked this series and would recommend that it be developed.  It kept you on the edge of your seat and I found the characters interesting and believable.  The alien was especially cool.,Positive
To easy for others to use and children to get. Got credit and they told me how to block when gaming.,Negative
"Heart warming, gentle, witty, and subtly outrageously funny. Morgan play a sweet curmudgeon whose heart slowly melts each day as he spend more time in the Belle, a truly magical place where goodness is brought out in the most cynical of people. Virginia Madsen plays a wise, patient and loving mother of three very different daughters. Other characters on the island are quirky but good solid people. Makes one wish she could live in the Belle for the rest of her life.",Positive
"I'd not seen any episodes for several years.  I have seen Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley, and Julia Sawalha in many other projects and always enjoy their work so figured since I had the chance would watch some f these episodes.  I admit, it takes a few minutes to get into &#34;the grove&#34; of the shows.  Once pulled in they are hilarious. For a real treat check out season 6 episodes also.",Positive
"The research to do this show must have been monumental.  Great story line, lot's of action. And even a little old Grandma was able to set it up to show on our big TV.  Amazon is opening a bigger world for us.",Positive
Now don't get me wrong but anybody that looks that good and has that much money and sleeps with women that are well...just his type then he is a scoundrel which is just fine....,Positive

"Everyone complains about their job, but somehow the produces came up with a series that makes you hope someday they would put your dirty job on the show. Even if they never put your's on the air, it is well worth watching it, a good lesson to remind everyone of what real hard labor is. We forget what it is like to do these dirty but necessary jobs, my only regret is that they never had rich and famous people who never worked a day in their life or got their hands dirty to guest hosting the show. LoL",Positive
Great PG-13 fun for connecting Mother's and Daughter's (or generations) and a little blood and gore for the boys and men in the family. Modern day sci-fi (nite-time soap) with interesting twists & turns that keep me coming back. Have fun....,Positive
"This is a prequel to the Burn Notice series. It is designed to tell the story of how Bruce Campbell's character Sam Axe ended up in Miami. It is essentially an hour and a half long episode, which aside from a 5 min cameo from Jeffrey Donovan, involves his character exclusively. It definitely misses things like the character interaction, quick wit and even the voice overs you get in the series. It just makes it feel a little off.The story centers around Sam having to train a ragtag band of farmers in Columbia who are mistakenly branded a terrorist organization to survive an attack by a corrupt paramilitary organization who want their land. There are also the requisite North American aid workers who get involved in the story, and toward the end a couple bumbling CIA officers who show up in Season 7 of the TV show. The story kind of skirts the line between serious and campy, and does have some tie ins to the show (like the origin of Sam's alias Chuck Finley).While Campbell did a fine acting job and plays his character well, I just think it lacked what makes the TV show so great. I know there are some people who really dislike this, and if you were expecting it to be more like the TV show as opposed to a stand alone movie, I can understand that sentiment. It is certainly not something that you have to see in order to understand anything in the series. Aside from knowing who the CIA agents are when they show up in the 7th season of the TV show, there is nothing else from this that has been tied in.As far as extras, there is audio commentary, some deleted scenes and a feature on Jeffrey Donovan directing. Overall I think it is OK. Certainly not great, but for a $10 blu ray disc, it was worth the price.",Negative
"In this unexpectedly charming movie, a likable alcoholic is challenged with saving an Irish community of fishermen from a blood-sucking alien invasion through reckless inebriation.  Now I understand that this plot may leave you pondering &#34;just how good could this movie really be?&#34;  Just take my word for it and give this film a chance.  Think Shaun of the Dead.Our unlikely hero is local drunkard Ciar&aacute;n O'Shea (Richard Coyle; BBC's Coupling) and, of course, he of all people makes the discovery that the tentacular aliens are allergic (even deadly so) to the local lushes' high blood-alcohol content.  Nice choice to begin your invasion, aliens.  You're deathly allergic to alcohol and you crash-landed off the coast of Ireland.  Smart choice!Because we can't have a proper hero without some romantic tension, the local bar wench exerts some uncomfortable yet cute pressure in coupling Lisa (Ruth Bradley; Beauty and the Beast, Primeval) with O'Shea.  Ruth Bradley and Richard Coyle fair splendidly as a dainty prude who is drunk for the first time (in order to survive) flirting with a drunk who is trying to sober up to impress her.  The warm fuzzy levity is abundant and their flirtatious relationship comes off as shockingly convincing.  And by the way, Ruth Bradley really rises to the challenge of acting drunk.They had some fun with the gore effects.  This movie isn't exactly &#34;gory&#34; but it still has its fun with rolling severed heads.  The CGI alien monsters look a lot like the giant facehugger that brings down the engineer towards the end of Prometheus (2012).  In fact, you'll delight in the cephalopodic mayhem when it actually &#34;facehugs&#34; a victim.  They look great!  Oh, and the hatchling grabbers make adorable squeaky sounds like a Pomeranian chew toy--they're so cute&#8230;until they attack.The dialogue is nothing short of charming and excellent throughout the movie.  Almost any time I wasn't laughing out loud, I was grinning at the marriage of the silliness of these scenes coupled with oft-alcohol-induced dialogue.  The characters all play off of each other splendidly and the chemistry between O'Shea and his flirtatious rookie drinker Lisa is a much slurred splendor.",Positive
"He has decent storyline and I was looking forward to this as I love Kevin Bacon, but trite plots, very lame writing, and predictable.  I like his character though.",Negative
This is one of the best series I've seen. I could hardly wait to see the next episode. The characters are truly believable in their portrayals of the country way of living in the beautiful English countryside. Perfectly cast are each and everyone of the characters. I highly recommend seeing all the seasons.,Positive
"If you must watch this I would say watch teh first half and turn it off, as soon as you hit the horrorifying slaughter house footage, its downhill.This could have been a really powerful wonderful documentary but instead decided to be over the top Peta ad.All the hidden footage of animals in slaughter houses are not given enough context.Go watch Forks over Knives you will learn more.",Negative
"A waste of time and money.  Theatrical exclamations and much head shaking by the author of a ""book"" on the subject.  Apparently he saves the ""Interesting"" details for his book, (if there were any at all).",Negative
Loved everything about this sitcom especially that it breaks out into song throughout the episode. It's definitely a change of pace from the usual stale formula of T.V. sitcoms or any show for that matter.,Positive
This is a real think outside the box show. Science fiction at it's finest (or is it fiction) hummm! I avoided watching this show for a couple of seasons. Then purchased the first season from Amazon and I was hooked. It is a weird show which I think makes it all the better! ;-),Positive
"I own every episode. This is a buy item, no rent, good enough to watch several times over. Finally a US cop show on the level of all the great Brit stuff. Hope it runs for a decade. Tess Garritsen is the novel author behind the beginning of ""Rozzoli & Isles"" as well as credited for writing the series. Jane Tamaro is producer and writer of the series. That's a combo as good as the two female leads. Women's ability in the acting and creative areas are making this one of the best shows on TV/DVD from America.A super fantastic cop show taking place in the alleys, parking garages, streets, and fine places of beautiful Boston. But the crime is as ugly as the city is beautiful. And speaking of beauty, the 2 protagonists are hot. Angie Harmon plays Det. Jane Rozzoli the tough, sexy, sometimes sweet, sometimes funny murder investigator who takes on some bad boys and gets herself into dire straights. She has the scars to prove it, but the figure of a goddess. Her partner in crime, solving that is, comes in Medical Examiner Dr. Maura Isles, played by the equally gorgeous Sasha Alexander. She's loaded with nerdy trivia, which annoys Rozzoli, but gets the job done. She has nerves of iron and also injects many comic moments. It's a fine balancing act of suspense and comedy in a mystery crime show that works great.Other cast members come into their own in different episodes. It is a series that has created a fine cast that quickly feels like family. Everyone has a history with a bit of a dark side as well as some fine personal moments. Lorraine Bracco is Ma Rozzoli, a generation older but yet a looker and doer. Her son Frankie Jr. (Jordan Bridges) is a Boston foot cop. Two other members of the murder squad are Det. Frost (Lee Thompson Young) who hates gore and Det. Korsak (Bruce McGill) older and wiser. They all appear each episode and play an important role.Subtitles available for all Episodes:We are FamilyIn Over Your HeadBut I am a Good GirlKiller in High HeelsDance with the DevilSomebody's Watching MeAll For OneCold as IceJudge Jury and ExecutionerPartners in CrimeTears of a ClownDon't forget there are 3 previous years of Rozzoli & Isles.

"Perhaps one of the greatest shows on TV.  Reminiscent of &#34;HOUSE&#34;, I see a lot of parallels (scruffy beard, drug use, arrogance, inspiration (often the final clue to the mystery) from his associate(s), and general genius) which I enjoy immensely.  I had the opportunity to watch the Pilot and early episodes again.  Watson (I LOVE Lucy Liu) was a little rough in the beginning -- but it takes time to establish the chemistry.  They are a PERFECT pair now.  These are very well (but not perfectly) thought out mysteries and Holmes, Watson, Gregson, and Bell all work amazing well together.  Two words: WATCH IT!  (It would be nice if Sherlock started calling her Dr. Watson -- the only thing I miss about the characters.)  Oh, and the whole Moriarty sub plot/story &#8211; excellent!!!  (No spoiler here.)",Positive
"I have a special needs son and their are a few programs that if he doesn't get to see enough of one day he will pretty much just nut up. So it is a blessing and a saving grace that we are able to have these right at our fingertips to show him and the  quality is just awesome, better then my tv actually.",Positive
I'm hooked on this terrific show.  It's all about fairy tales made for adults.  Highly recommended for imaginative people of all ages.,Positive
Absolute amazing show. All the characters are great and well played. Archer is one of the best shows ever. Awesome!,Positive
"Yeah, this was a surprise.  Sounded dull so it was the last one I watched but there's a lot of sharp dialogue in here and I think it's pretty well cast.  Betas isn't high concept, its not full of stars or famous faces, but its got real charm and verve and I hope to see more.I think people will find this one.",Positive

Best of the Pilots - Good to see eric overmyer on this project - can certainly see his influences from his work on The Wire and Treme.  Also great to see a few of the Actors from the Wire!,Positive
"I've followed the story of Temperance and Booth ever since the beginning and I am charmed, beguiled and in love with all the ensemble characters.  I also really appreciate the way they've all been allowed to adapt and develop.  It keeps the story fresh and original.  I know it can get a little silly and unabashedly romantic sometimes, but the scientific appearance and jargon, the excellent writing and the interaction between the personable charm of Booth and the beautiful remoteness of Bones balances it all out, for me, anyway.",Positive
As good as the book! Each chapter kept me engaged. Can't wait for the next season to come out. Excellent!,Positive

"This film received mostly negative reviews or lukewarm at best, with the exception of UK's ""Empire"" magazinethat gave it 5 star (Unmissable) rating.I am not a fan of Nicholas Winding Refn whose ""Drive""(also starring Ryan Gosling) I found over-rated.However, after watching this film, I understand the filmmakers' purpose of making this moody, contemplative, posturing,slow with sudden violence interruptions, well complemented by dark with saturated color cinematography and good soundtrack.All lead actors gave strong performances, Kristen Scott Thomas, the Thai actor who played the police captain in particular,and even Ryan Gosling whom I found lately overexposed with roles of familiar territories in a role more suited to his persona.This is an operatic art film, may only be appreciated by the selected few.",Positive
"I thought it was a bit dismal for me.  Tired of &#34;heavy&#34; tv shows, especially as I'm winding down and getting ready for bed.",Negative
"Television has been called a vast wasteland. I've heard people rant and rave for years about having so many channels and nothing to watch on TV. And then I started looking at two things. The first was my television watching schedule which has actually begun cutting into my DVD watching schedule (so little time, so much to watch). Then I looked at my shelving unit and noticed the number of TV series collections there. People are wrong. There is plenty good to watch on TV. And DEXTER is an example of it.For those who aren't aware, DEXTER is a series on Showtime, so many of you might not have seen it. If that's the case you're in luck because the series has been released on DVD. While season two has just hit shelves in blu-ray format, the focus here is season one.Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department. His job is to help collect and understand evidence found at the scene of a crime that involves blood and blood splatter patterns. Oh, and on the side, Dexter is a serial killer.Stay with me here because he's not a bad guy really. Well...then again maybe he is. After all he is a murderer multiple times over. The difference is that Dexter only kills bad guys. Dexter kills murderers, pedophiles, arsonists and the like that got off due to some technicality. But he always verifies that they were guilty before taking them out of the picture.Dexter's foster father Harry (James Remar) was a police man who found Dexter at the scene of a crime before adopting him. Harry recognized the killing instinct found in Dexter at an early age so he helped him to channel that, to use rules that he established for Dexter, to get through life. And via Harry's rules, Dexter now kills bad guys using his job as a means to find just the right victims.So there is the basic set up for the series. But it's so much more than that, filled with layer upon layer of subtext and inner meaning that is revealed as the series progresses.Season one focuses first on letting us know who Dexter is and who the surrounding cast of characters involved with him are. First off is his sister Deb (Jennifer Carpenter), a seemingly spastic patrol officer dying to become a homicide detective. Deb's enthusiasm for the job is off set by her self deprecating ways and the giddiness she exhibits for all things.At the stations there are two main characters who affect Dexter. The first is Lt. Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez) his direct supervisor who at times seems to have a personal interest in Dexter. A woman who's made it where she is by hard work, she has a storyline of her own involving police office politics as the series progresses.The second is Sgt. James Doakes (Eric King), Dexter's apparent nemesis. Doakes is a hard boiled cop from top to bottom, a no nonsense sort who wants answer and wants them now. Doakes is constantly badgering Dexter, offering everything from name calling to in your face attitude. One would think that eventually the two of them would reach a point where there wouldn't be room for both of them in Miami. One would think.Along with these major players there is an assortment of cast members in the squad who round out the ensemble in the best way possible. And each gets enough screen time in season one to make them a character to care about. The interaction between them on a personal level comes into play as the layers of Dexter unravel.On the personal side, Dexter actually has a girlfriend. Normal on the outside, but not within. It seems Dexter has taken her as his girlfriend to help appear normal. It is through his thoughts (voice over into Dexter's mind runs throughout the series) concerning her that he lets us know he is devoid of emotion, that he has no feelings. His involvement with her is purely as a means to offer him cover.Rita (Julie Bienz) is a battered wife, or at least she was. Dexter's sister was on call when her ex was arrested. Paul, her ex, was a wife beater extreme and a drug user to boot. Now in prison, he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family's life crosses Dexter's life as well.With characters and plot lines established, you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do. Instead, Dexter finds himself in a competition of sorts when a new serial killer hits Miami. And this killer is leaving calling cards that Dexter not only finds discomforting but amazing as well. He's impressed with the style and artistic ability of the killer who leaves his victims in pieces and drained of blood.As each episode continues the tale, we find that this new killer referred to as the Ice Truck Killer (when it's discovered that he uses one to haul victims from their murder location to where he leaves their bodies) knows something about Dexter. He leaves small clues at first for Dexter to find. Eventually he leaves Polaroid's of Dexter's past as well. It seems that the perfect serial killer is being stalked by his own serial killer.Season one not only defines who the character of Dexter is it offers the world he lives in and tosses in his biggest match to boot. How Dexter became who he is and what influences him is told in flashback. His motivations are shown by the end of this season as is the identity of the Ice Truck Killer. But will that change who Dexter is? Doubtful since season four begins soon.What makes this show so unique is that it combines one of the most frightening characters one can imagine, a soul less who cares serial killer, with one of the wittiest funny line spouting people seen on TV. Dexter tosses off subtle one liners non-stop and each one offers a glimpse behind the mask and a laugh as well.But the amazing thing is that not only do we find ourselves repulsed and attracted to the same character, we find in the writing that there is more to him than is even he realizes. The character of Dexter may think he possesses no emotions whatsoever but his emotions run deeper than he realizes. And it seems as though his journey of self revelation may be what's driving the series forward in later seasons.Also Dexter offers something that many of us would never want to admit we seek. An avenging angel out there doing what so many would love to know is going on but at the same time turn their head and condemn on the outside. Like Jack Bauer of ""24"", a hero who uses tactics we claim to hate while hoping someone like him exists to protect us, Dexter is the privately admired solution for those who feel that the worst of criminals are let lose on technicalities. We would fear someone like Dexter while at the same time would love to see someone who doesn't let the bad guy get away with murder. Even though this is what Dexter does, murder.There is no way to offer up in this short space just what it is that Dexter is about. Police procedural. Police politics. Serial killer. Murder mystery. Family complexities. Killing tutorial. Hilarious dark comedy. All are a part of Dexter and all come together in a fantastic package.If you're not afraid to try something a little different, then you need to give Dexter a try. I know the season one set I watch belonged to my son. After watching I intend to get a copy of my own. And to continue with it down the line. I'm already hard at work watching season two on blu-ray to write about. Unusual, quirky, off beat, scary, normal...all are words that define Dexter. And yet none can explain what this series is all about. Watch and see.",Positive
This isn't your typical cowboy shoot em up show. Yes there are violent scenes but  the dialogue is well written and even Rayland's nemesis Boyd has redeeming qualities.,Positive

"This is a great opening. Nonstop excitement. Definitely my new favorite. Of course it is only episode one, so I'll be watching more episodes and reviewing. So far I am wholeheartedly behind it. They've touched on just about all the questions left at the end of the last season. Darn. I wanted a two hour premiere.....Episode two. What can you say, complete ethical hairball. On one hand Nick was unwillingly drugged out of his mind, and magically turned into a killing machine. Was it his fault? Is he to blame for the actions he perpetrated after Samedi made him into a zombie? Or were Samedi and Eric Renard the true murderers? On the other hand, someone died, and it was Nick's body was the tool that caused the death. And that poor family, those kids. Awful. Does Nick's lack of consent, his being forcibly drugged eliminate his responsibility? Maybe. Two have been punished for their horrible misdeeds. Eric and the Baron. Is it enough? If Nick is held responsible for what he could not control, will justice be served?The group has made their choice. And I think it is pretty expected. They are now all bound by the decision, yet Nick is going to be tortured by it, it is only because he is a good man that he is so horribly torn and troubled. I do not see why Renard has kept the flash, best destroy it completely. And in Europe Adalind is messing with Sean's child, and also and accessory to murder as a much more aware participant... surely that can not be forgiven, is more heinous a crime. What is going to happen next? Certainly living up to the Horror show tag. Can't wait for more. The Renards... Nick.... Adalind.... Nick looking like a zombie again....where is that gonna go? Eek.",Positive
"One of the better done shows in a long time, it would be a serious mistake notto make this a regular multi-season show, I just cannot say enough good about  it.",Positive
"I had my doubts about this movie but decided to watch it anyway. I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised, this turned out to be a pretty good movie. Interesting characters and story revolving around inter dimensional events. Good action and interesting special effects, if you are a Sci Fi fan then this movie is for you. This is a really good popcorn movie so check it out!",Positive
"Did like the premise of the show for a while, and also liked the video quality plus the sound seemed a little better than other shows. Since only one episode was watched I can not attest to the rest. Russian spies in our own backyard, and FBI moves right across the street, seemed a little to easy to accept. Time to watch a couple more episodes. 3.5 Stars!",Positive
I never watched this show when it was broadcast and I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't have been able to handle the wait between weeks and seasons. Binge watching this show made it much more enjoyable and I can't wait for the movie because the way the show was cancelled in the middle of a season was a travesty. WATCH IT!,Positive
The struggles are even worse this year it seems for everyone.  I truly don't know how these people keep coming back sometimes when it seems to take everything they have to turn a dime by seasons end.,Positive
"This is an enjoyable series as long as you are OK with some logical inconsistencies.  The special effects,  action and acting are very good... the science, not so much.",Positive
"While on the lighter side of the detective genre, it's good for a work night; very entertaining. Am a regular subscriber.",Positive
"The first season is great with a twisty and compelling storyline. Unfortunately, the second season isn't as good. I still recommend it though.",Positive
I hate the constant fighting between moms & Abby & Christie always crying .( grow up Christie )But my kids remind me that the show is called &#34; &#34;Dance moms&#34; for a reason -- I like the girls dancing: beautiful & entertaining,Positive
"Great casting, super chemistry between the characters, lovable but immature rookie cops working to proof themselves and lots of romantic relationships going on between the cops in district 15 while they successfully solve the crime of the day.",Positive
"I like it but it has a slow beginning.  If you can get through the first 5 episodes, you will begin to get interested.  So give it a chance.  Two positives about watching it on Amazon.  The first is that you don't have to wait a week between episodes. The second and most important is that there are no commercials.  So give it a try and get past the first 5 episodes.",Positive
I very much like the characters and plots. True to the late Elmore Leonard's writing and subtle twists in plot lines.,Positive
"Quick Take: Essentially, this is half a season for half the price. A non-sale, non-discounted price of 19.95 fits in line with almost six hours worth of DVD content. A full season, had it been released that way, would simply have doubled the asking price.Last year, History and A&E; Television made the dubious decision to start releasing Volumes of their most popular shows as opposed to Seasons. I was one of the most vocal opponents of this move and some of my scathing tirades can be found on those initial releases. In truth, though, I have nothing against the idea of volume releases (especially for shows that aren't held together by continuing plot threads) as long as three things are clear:1) They need to be priced according to content and no more expensive individually than a season set would be.2) Don't start releasing Full Seasons and then switch tactics mid-stream to confuse unsuspecting buyers.3) If it isn't a season, all content needs to be disclosed on the DVD packaging so the consumer knows what they are getting!Last year, many of these early Volume releases broke my second and third rule. I mean really! How can you release a DVD when it's not a full season and NOT tell buyers how many and which episodes are included? Absolutely unforgivable. I need that information to decide whether or not I want to purchase the set. As we have progressed, though, and the notion that we're to continue with Volume releasing has stayed with us, the point becomes rather more muddy. Now, we're past the second issue and the third issue has been corrected. All of these Volume releases now contain information about the content. So, there is no deception and no confusion. You get ""x"" number of episodes for ""x"" price. It's now up to you whether or not it's worth it. That's fair. If you don't like it, don't buy it.Volume Four of ""Pawn Stars"" contains sixteen episodes over two discs for just shy of six hours worth of content, basically consisting of the second half of Season Three. There are no Special features, but English and Spanish subtitles are optional. Included:(1) Cornering the Colonel, (2) Ready, Set, Pawn, (3) The Eagle Has Landed, (4) Like A Rolling Chum, (5) Hello Nurse, (6) Chumdog Millionaire, (7) Gone With the Schwinn, (8) Bare Bones, (9) Never Surrender, (10) Honest Abe, (11) Monkey Business, (12) Packing Heat, (13) Luck of the Draw, (14) Houdini's Handcuffs, (15) Pedal to the Metal, and (16) Case Closed.The show is entertaining for several reasons. Of course, some intriguing merchandise passes through their hands and you just might learn something. But as in any reality show, this one is as much about interaction and conversation as it is about the art of the deal. The Harrison guys are a colorful crew--real old school Vegas. Perhaps the biggest scene stealer is Chumlee (like an adopted son) who plays village idiot, but can surprise you as well. It's comical and engaging for the most part. All in all, it is rather like the unsavory and confrontational cousin to the classic ""Antiques Roadshow"" with more grit and edge. KGHarris, 6/12,",Positive
Timothy Olyphant keeps outdoing himself as each season progresses - such a cool customer! Walton Goggins is fascinating as Boyd Crowder - the scenes from earlier seasons when he played a preacher were excellent. My only complaint with the series is the keep killing off the really good bad guys!,Positive
"My son is 9 and LOVES the Wild Kratts. These are 2 funny guys who have a great time with animals. They don't dumb it down or use irritating repetitive songs so I've found myself taking a break and enjoying an episode here and there also. I strongly recommend this program for any kid who has curious about the great outdoors, animals of all kinds and having fun.",Positive
"Violence, Sex, & some roughly based history, what is not to like about ROME?If you love spear and sandal movies this is one for you, its not as good as the newer Spartacus: Blood and Sand  but it is well worth watching. The story is believable, the acting is good, and there is fun action and adventure in it.As we keep stating; Violence, sex, & some roughly based history, what is not to like about ROME?",Positive
The highest praise I can give is I want to see more.  Great acting and casting; I want to know more about the lives of these characters and see the world from their point of view.,Positive
"I had heard about this show, so I decided to rent the first episode. I had no idea what it was about.Major smile when I found out it was a Joss Whedon series about S.H.I.E.L.D.Another smile, Agent Phil Coulson is back! It's great to see Clark Gregg back in this role. It would have been a major disappointment to see any other actor playing Coulson. Gregg brings a certain ""coolness"" to the roll with his style of humor and devlish smirk. He also gets a flying Corvette.The first three episodes have been fun to watch. The team is coming together nicely with some neat gadgets and interesting stories. We also get to see some Whedon alumni, such as J. August Richards and Ron Glass.This show has some major potential. I hope ABC gives Whedon/show a chance.With Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., ""Once Upon A Time In Wonderland"" and Once Upon A Time, ABC has my attention for at least three hours a week now.4 stars for media is a really good rating from me. This show will have to get really, really good to deserve 5 stars.&#9830;Season one review&#9830;The show is near the end of the season. I purchased a season pass and have watched all the shows at least twice. Although I really like the program I was hoping for more superhero type stuff. I want to see people with more special powers. All the characters are becoming nicely defined except Grant Ward. Skye's character is getting more interesting especially after the Jan 14/Seeds episode. I am glad the story behind Coulson's death is getting more time. And what about this Clairvoyant?ABC needs to give us more Clark Gregg humor. He is one of the wittiest 'one liners' on TV. We need more Kung Fu fighting from May. Fitz&Simmons; need more involvement and more secret agent gadgets. Skye needs a neat super power. And please....more character development with Grant(yall are totally ignoring him).As I said, I really like the show but ABC could be doing A LOT MORE with it. It is just hanging in there with 4 stars but if ABC wants to bring it to ""Once Upon A Time"" level/5 star status, ABC needs to beef it up in season two.",Positive
"NBC has cancelled this show because it needs to do better in the ratings.  Its odds of coming up with something better are about nil, especially given its recent track record. Getting rid of this show, one of its best ever, is yet another miscalculation on its part and I expect the network to only sink further.  Except for SNL, I don't think I will be watching NBC at all once this goes off the air.What is going on in this season is that all the characters are being wound up so that as the show closes you are not left in limbo about what happened to these characters.  This means that there are marriages in store for some of these characters.  There is a meaningful death. There is, above all, great humor in each and every episode.I will miss most of all Alec Baldwin playing Jack and I only hope he goes on to play another comedic character on tv.  I'm sure he'll be tempted to go back into movies but he has done such a spectacular job on the small screen that I hope he sticks with it. Although he can do drama, comedy is where he really belongs.You cannot go wrong watching this or any season of 30 Rock.",Positive
"at its best! The collection of characters makes viewing an adventure. Each of their quirks turns the ordinary into the hilarious. Must viewing for anyone who appreciates small town life, or clerical committee work.",Positive
"If you like watching tormenting love stories, you gonna love this one. It just rips you apart every moment. Very sad and very torturous. Then it turns hopeful and then again drags you to suicide. I LOVE how it ended she takes a breath to tell him something....and black screen.",Positive
Awesome Show for anyone who likes old stuff. Funny and educational with engaging characters. Have seen stuff on this show I've never seen before!,Positive
This season has even more complexity as the pair seem (at times) to get along. Very complex client line makes this one move quickly.,Positive
"This was an incredible series, along the lines of Nikita, but better. The lead character is a great actress, for the part, who has a great nack for getting into the hearts of those she is spying on and becoming very believable in what ever role she is portraying for them. Not to mention the fact that she packs quite a punch. I hope this series will continue. If I was disappointed about anything with this series, it would only be, that the first series ended all too quickly. Keep coming back, I want to see more.",Positive
"This show is fantastic! It's action packed drama, it makes you laugh, cry, and keeps you on the edge of your seat! I love this show and will miss it greatly! I bought the final season for my husband for Christmas and he'll be very excited when he opens it! :)",Positive
"I lived in Arizona - and to see Amy's Bakery - Scottsdale, AZ - It would be one place I will NEVER GO!! When the owners takes the tips from the servers.. SO BAD!! IT IS NOT FAIR,,",Positive
"I don't know what to write. This show is bad. Corny dialogue, vague apocalyptic event that has caused mayhem in the world and uninteresting characters. Not for me.",Negative
"I chose this rating of 5 starts because Timothy Opyphant is a great actor, and you always wonder how he's gonna get out of the predictiment he's in, but somehow he does.  I hate it when he gets beat up though.I would recommend this to adults only.  To much language and fighting for anyone younger.",Positive
"This series appeared to be historically acurate from my limited knowledge of the period.  I do remember JFK and several things that happened during and following his presidency.  I would think that if there is a second season, we might learn about Ted, JFK Jr. and other younger Kennedys.",Positive
"Awesome show especially if your a vampire enthusiast. Played well, no problems. Thanks",Positive
"Though he may not have the type of characteristic and overt style which turns directors into households name, Kevin Macdonald is among the more gifted and interesting film artists of his generation, able to step with ease from the art-house to the studio system and from documentaries (One Day in September, Touching the Void) to narrative features (The Last King of Scotland, State of Play).  His latest, How I Live Now, is an end-of-the-world drama which for a while plays as a modern fairy tale before segueing into a more traditional, but still exciting and well-paced story of pursuit and political strife.  The films open with troubled American teenager Daisy, played by Saoirse Ronan, coming to England to live for a time with family friends.  Their rural farmhouse is a wonder of production design, crowded to the ceiling with artifacts indicating a deep history of fascinating world travels, and Macdonald does not fail to capitalize on the old-world beauty of the building and the pastoral area in which it is situated.The film can be divided into three distinct parts, and the first focuses on the thorny Daisy's slow embrace of her new situation and the people around her.  Predictable, perhaps, but sold through novel use of voice-over (Daisy's thoughts, from eating-disorder anxieties to vicious barbs against her absent father to inward pleas to step outside of her comfort zone, are laid atop one another in disorienting explosions of sound reflective of a teenage mind on the verge of frenzy) and the vivid performance of Ronan, given a rare chance to play a 21st-century teenager who is neither otherworldly nor melancholy and soulful beyond her years, but instead angry and flawed in recognizable ways.While her step-aunt is away, a nuclear bomb is dropped on London as a third World War begins.  The focus of the film remains tightly focused on Daisy, her love interest Edmond, and his siblings as they try to understand events transpiring around the globe from their limited perspective:  the power goes out, nuclear ash falls and coats the gardens, etc.  This section of the film is unusual, hypnotic, and, in a sinister way, very beautiful, resembling Lord of the Flies by way of Alice in Wonderland as the small group of children have only each other to turn as the distant world tears itself apart, both protected and entombed by the isolation of the farmhouse.  Once the military enter How I Live Now, bringing with them martial law, gender divided camps, and the specters of execution and rape, it becomes a more easily understood disciple of 28 Days Later, Children of Men, and other recent films depicting modern society in free fall, but the lead performance by Ronan remains riveting, and there is an admirable refusal to turn away from the grim aspects of warfare and social disorder, rendering this an unusual example of a teen centric film with a relatively hard R rating.  One or two conceits which were fine in the novel from which the film is adapted, including the ambiguous nature of the force invading Britain (nationality?  political views?), prove a bit frustrating in a cinematic context, but this is still an inventive and worthy example of the post-apocalyptic film.",Positive
This was not very entertaining.  I was done before the show was.  Anybody giving this more than 3 stars must be stoned.,Negative
The second season so far is great. Love the actors and actresses.  I really wish the main protagonist ended up with Jack and not the switched girl.  But oh well. I'ts not my show.,Positive
This is one show you will want to watch each week.. The first season quickly lead me into the second season and now awaiting to see if they will have a third season..,Positive
"Inspector Foyle behaves and speaks exactly as we would ideally wish to have done in his place in the threatening environment of wartime where subtlety and nuance tended to get lost. In WWII Hastings, a resort town on the south coast of England, the proximity of the German forces across the Channel pushed people to make hasty decisions, often based on prejudice and invariably without pausing to reflect. Foyle is the epitome of patience, bravely resisting pressure from his superiors and the war department, creating time and space to see justice done no matter how complex the circumstances, He is assisted by two younger assistants who share his humanity and learn from his stoical attitude. It is hard not to feel that people like Foyle were the true heroes of the war effort because they constantly reminded everyone of the values we were fighting for.",Positive
Awesome series. Waiting on season 5! Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love.,Positive
"Have enjoyed the show up until season 3, and would have mostly likely continued viewing enjoyment but the series is unlocatable on my Amazon video.",Negative
The tv series is enjoyable but not very believable.  Disasters certainly bring out the stupid in people.It was nice to see a show that didn't have zombies.,Positive
Honestly was surprised how watching a serial killer who kills other serial killers sucks a person into the show so easily.,Positive
Makes me laugh out loud every show ! in love with Nick! fancy man 1&2 are my favorites! Thank You!,Positive
"I love this show, It's great to have a cop show that's also a Rom-Com and to top it off it's based in Florida who doesn't love that. Great writing a cop show with out all the pretense of having to be serious. A light hearted cop show.",Positive
"Wasn't so sure at first on this one but it's awesome... It is a bit gruesome but the cinematography, acting and story lines are all captivating if you aren't bothered by the subject matter. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys Criminal Minds or the like.",Positive
5 starskeeping the faith that they might all get richI like how they work there way thru all the trials and tribulations would definetly recommend this show,Positive
"Our story, picks up a few years later from where season 1 left us - waiting and wanting for more.  And more there is!  For those who have not watched season1 some of the tension in the relationships will be lost.  The sequel brings us full circle with the integrity of the newscast continuing to be the centerpiece.  Love for sale, love for rent, and love misspent swim in the undercurrent of the decline of London's almost middle class in a backdrop of county first with the beginning of a ramped up atomic arms race.  So, get a spot of tea and enjoy the fine acting and nifty sets.",Positive
I dud not like this movue st all.  I would not recommend it to anyone.I did nit enjoy the story.  Would not support the story line at all.,Negative
"Taking place during the Cold War, the sets are incredibly reminiscent of that period of history, down to details like the wallpaper on the walls.  The series is full of unanticipated twists and turns and features a fascinating portrayal of a 'marriage' under the stress and strain of constant deception.  The whole enterprise is taut and fascinating and I can't wait to see the whole series!",Positive
"Very intriguing, another FX drama that you don't want to stop watching- you get hooked fast and beg for more.",Positive
"Who would have guessed a summer fill in would end being a cliff hanger, and then turned into a annual showI loved it.... and waiting for the next seasonThank You Amazon",Positive
I've watched all seasons but couldn't finish this one. Brandi's racial remarks and then Lisa's husband's remarks to maid when she asked for just one dress of the many  that Lisa was giving away. All the maid said is she wished she could have one. And he jumped all over her ugh! That did it for me. This show has gone down hill. Nobody gets along anymore. Atleast before there were some fun times. Like I said after the maid thing I was done. Too bad I spent my money on this. That just gives all of them them more money . Like they need anymore than they have already.,Negative
Good program. Interesting angle here. I was really getting into the characters and the program and wham! It was over! I really wanted that next episode to see what happens.,Positive
"This award winning documentary challenges your mind while igniting  your synapses. This is an entertaining informative series that should be referenced by student, teacher and writer. Well worth your time.Richie",Positive
One of all time favorite detectives - Love all episodes - wish there were more. No one can outsmart Poirot.,Positive
This is a good show but what ruins it is the scripted dialogue which is unnecessary. Just let the people be themselves and not try to turn them into &#34;actors&#34;.,Positive
Pink is one of the sweetest and honest people in the business.  I have the pleasure of working with here in L.A. and I have always thought she was one of the most talented and REAL Music entertainers I have worked with.  I think this concert shows you how she is to everyone.  She is a Star!,Positive
"I have watched the first three episodes of DOMINION. I already love this show and hope it will last because I will be engaged as long as it will be on. The special effects are stunning, even the raven looking wings look real, like they belong on the humans that are acting. It's worth watching this show just for special effects. Actually I was delighted to see a familiar face in Roxanne Mackee from game of Thrones in Dominion.The show it self seems promising, it brings about the struggle of good and evil, a trait we all have in us, wether we like to admit it or not. I wasn't so sure after the pilot, but now I can see that this show could be a winner. A show starts with a story and in my opinion it's very well written. I really like the the concept of Angels as arch types in a show. We seem to have forgotten them. Gabriel has chosen to be an enemy of Humanity whereas Michael has chosen to join them. There is no mention yet where the other arch angels, but altogether there are seven of them; Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, Uriel, Raguel, Remiel and Saraqael.Uriel comes on the scene in the third episode and is a woman. She is using trickery on both of her brothers, Michael and Gabriel. Uriel is a face of God and when Michael complains about theit Heavenly Father abandoning their children, she answers: he never left. Uriel is the bringer of light and is the Archangel most connected with earth. It will be interesting to see how things play out with Alex the chosen one. But what if God abandoned us all?I think it's interesting in a conversation between Michael and Gabriel that God allegedly questioned himself and his creation and is disappointed in humanity who is turning our planet into a garbage pit. It certainly makes us think that maybe we should queston our selfs, since it might be possible for God. It gives us something to think about, like how really bad our stewardship is we have been trusted with on this earth. It gives an opportunity to think how wrong we are about many things and what we could do right.",Positive
Still enjoy watching although season 2 is a little slower.  It is great to watch without commercials.  A lot different than Battlestar Galactica from the 1980s..,Positive
"Shonda Rhimes, the creator of Scandal has created a strong and gripping show. The characters are never what you think even the most boring ones offer surprises in character twists.Best of all is Olivia Pope portrayed by the talented Kerry Washington. Olivia has layers! Her facial expressions alone are worth viewing.If you miss Scandal on TV it is worth purchasing it from Amazon some times you catch things you missed before.",Positive
"A thoughtful, amusing and enjoyable story. I like scenarios and the pace - normal and laid back. Hoping this one makes it.",Positive
My three year old daughter really enjoys this show. The songs are pretty catchy and its fun to sing them to prepare her for what's next in our day!,Positive
"Great show. Took the classic Michael Keaton Batman theme for the intro. Remember watching this as a kid. Only issue I have is why are the episodes out of order? If you look at each episode, it has the original air date. It starts right, but then jumps to November and all over. why can't they be in order Amazon?",Positive
"Was excited to see this, but I kept waiting for it to get good.Very predictable, very blah. I zoned out by the start of episode three",Negative
"The thing about this series is that it's a serial. It's not particularly episodic. Each episode builds on what went before. I was telling my sister, who hasn't started it yet, that at first you'll wonder what the fuss is about. Well, about midway through the series you'll be totally hooked and totally understand that it's a Shakespearean-style tragedy about greed, corruption, and the human genius for deceiving oneself. Additional aspects of the tragedy involve how innocent people get dragged into the protagonist's tragedy, with sometimes fatal results. And all along he tells himself he's doing it for his family. Yeah, right.",Positive
This show is well written and the characters are great. The story is a little rough at times but you have to consider the time line. I think men are more likely to like this show than women because of that.,Positive
My little daughter could watch this for hours! She love it! It has a great message! She shares it with her friends!,Positive
"I love Matt Smith and I was happy to see some more Amy and Rory episodes. Their joint venture comes to an end in this part of Season 7, but not to worry as the next companion is fun and quirky. I really appreciate having the same companion for so many seasons with Matt Smith as Dr. Who. I liked having younger characters for once that were more relate-able. I love all the Doctors, so no preference for Matt Smith overall. He continues to give a great performance in season 7.",Positive
"You must watch all three seasons.A television show that actually deals with classism, racism and sexism.Smart, sarcastic and entertaining.",Positive
"NEVER DISAPPOINTS! THE CHARACTERS ARE GREAT! YOU KNOW IT WILL BE ENTERTAINING TO WATCH EBERY EPISODE. TE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THE COMMERCIAL FOR OTHER SHOWS THRY ARE PUSHING ARE ALSO INCLUDED. WHEN YOU PURCHASE A SHOW TO WATCH YOU EXPECT IT TO BE COMMERCIAL FREE AND BE ABLE TO WATCH THE SHOW WITHOUT WASTING YOUR TIME ON STUFF YOU DONT WANT TO SEE, YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU PAID FOR AND THATS IT! I HOPE THEY FIX THIS",Positive
"It is my grandkids fvorite show. Gret music, theme adventure, always positive and helping the environment. It is a wonderful program for children.",Positive
This is an engaging show. It is amazing job done by people who are facinating in their own right. They are as real as it gets. No fake reality this.,Positive
"As a history nut, I always wondered why Mary, Queen of Scotland would endanger her life by going against her extremely shrewd and brilliant cousin, Elizabeth I, and claim a crown she was 4th inline for, when she was born a Queen of her own country.Now the historical record makes sense with the help of the great cast. Bashir my favourite, I love the fact that an INTELLECTUAL, OPEN MINDED BEING, is TRYING to show that PAGANS & PAGANISM are NOT evil people, doing evil deeds, nor are we DEVIL/SATAN worshipers. Christians created the concept of the devil, not the pagans.. Every religion has a few  fanatical lunatics, and I like the way the show represents those misguided, ignorant, people of that age.",Positive
This was a great show. Too bad it was taken off the air. I could have watched more and will miss it.,Positive
"I can't recommend this series enough. Excellent writing, excellent acting. As for so mant great series, they end way too soon. Highly recommend this series to all.",Positive
I watched this on a rainy afternoon and it did hold my interest.  All I can say is that it all works out in the end!!,Positive
Very nice. Great acting and storyline. Instant hit! Bring it on please. This could really be something really really special.,Positive
"An entertaining series ahead of the vampire craze, too bad the writers strike put an end to it.  Loved Jason Dohring as Josef  and Alex O'Loughlin's Mick was fascinating to watch.  I think the American accent came much easier to him than his co-star Sophia Myles.  I saw her recently in a Doctor Who episode and she was much more relaxed with that accent.",Positive
Sick of seeing Teresa never own up to a damn thing. She got better this season. Probably one of the best seasons since everyone seemed to be on better terms...finally. My favorite housewives out of all of them are jersey and New York.,Positive
Campy and fun.  Great special effects.  Nice character development.  I have enjoyed each season.  Looking forward to more seasons.  Not always kid appropriate!  Grimm is Grim.,Positive
"I was determined to make it to the end but I should not have been wanting the film to just be done.  The writer seems to have forgotten where the plot was supposed to go.  Scenes and actions and the choices that the characters make should be derived from the story's thesis---what was the writer's argument about life?  The writer knew the answers at the beginning and then forgot.I was bored throughout.  I got tired of staring at the main character's depressed and confused facial expressions.The main character had no direction in her life but plenty of commitment to self-centeredness.  Worst of all, I did not respect her.  Life just came along and pushed her into choices instead of her being a deliberate actor on her own behalf.  Who was she?  Where was her determination and sense of purpose?  And, finally, as far as the plot conclusion goes, where were the inevitable consequences for her lack of self-determination and purpose?",Negative
"The second season of this fantasy show is continuing to show the same great writing, great acting, and attention to detail that made the first season so much fun to watch. The individual episodes stand on their own as entertaining stories and the long arc of the series is developing well. I look forward to the next season with anticipation.",Positive
I really enjoy si-fi movies and shows. need more episodes please,Positive
I wish there were more seasons! :-(  I watched the two seasons in a sort or marathon and wanted more at the end.,Positive
This show has inspired me so much to start creating things they make. If you love special effects and like seeing the real thing not CGI you MUST watch this show!,Positive
Love this series. The young female detective is strong willed and smart. The show is exciting and fast moving and I really enjoy it.,Positive
Hilarious summary of all of the best internet videos.  Not politically correct and awesome.  Why waste hours surfing YouTube when you can see the best in a fraction of the time.,Positive
"Hate. the soap operatic sappinessLove: the twists, turns and political intriguethere is good enough acting by some of the characters to keep me thoroughly interested in the story. And the plot is a rollar coaster ride",Positive
Love this family.  They teach great lessons in the way that they deal with each other on a daily basis.  Great family entertainment.,Positive
"This is an excellent remake of the 80's slasher film!!  Gross, bloody, disturbing, fantastic, and entertaining!  This is a great slasher film that is wonderful to rewatch!",Positive
"Actually even if you didn't, your kids will probably like this.  There are all kids of references to Mr. Rogers in this so it's fun for parents.  The lessons are good.  The songs drill in your brain like a weevil, but if I ask my daughter to try a new food she'll sing ""you need to try new foods cause they might taste go-od"" and then she does so I guess it's a bit of a trade off.",Positive
I've seen a lot of the documentary footage before in other works.  That part plus the fabulous interviews I loved.  But it was impossible to watch because the camera technique is to jerk the camera around so much that it's hard on the eyes.,Negative
"[SPOILER ALERT] I really liked this film. Well, until the last 10 minutes. The end was flimsy and sort of a let down, which is why I'm giving it only 3 stars. It seemed...rushed, perhaps, or, that it was the only ending that could be crammed in the last few minutes. During the movie, the curmudgeon, Arlen, is likable. Not only that, but he dispenses fantastic wisdom throughout the movie (an indication, of course, that these are the things that the screenplay writer has been working out in his own head for years). But at the end, when Arlen tells everyone that he's never really talked to God, followed by a terse explanation that lacked any sort of sentiment at all, it made everyone feel foolish for believing in him, both the readers of his book, and the viewers of the movie. The thing about believing in God is that it's never what we think it is. God doesn't 'talk', but the things that we do, the magic that we create, the art, the beauty, that's God. We don't need a God to come down and give us an explanation of life in such a definitive way. Had Arlen said that he wrote the questions and then subsequently wrote the answers to those questions with the understanding that the arrival of the answers were indeed from a higher power, the magic of the movie (and the character) would have remained alive. As it is written, it's just a schmuck who doesn't believe in anything, not himself, not God, nothing except for a woman who lies to her son because she is too weak to face reality.It's hard to remain beholden to someone who's already sort of a jerk to begin with, then to realize that he's also a liar without a lot of faith in anything, well, that just makes us dislike him altogether. It would have been better if he told the truth and said that he thought that he had written those answers without the hand of God to guide him. But when he found love, then he realized that there was actually some Divine Power out there looking after him after all. In the spirit world, nothing is as we think it should be. That's what faith is. Faith is letting go of everything and trusting that your Higher Power will guide you, whether it's God, The Universe, your Ancestors, Buddha, Jesus, whatever. It never looks like we think it will, and the writer could have capitalized off of that. The writer should have given Arlen a profound revelation, or something that would have made the movie worthwhile. In the end, a very strong movie collapsed under the weight of an insouciant narcissist who wrote a book that he didn't even care about.I think that the writer should have kept the magic alive. He obviously wanted it to be a feel-good movie or else there would never have been the love story. He obviously put a lot of effort into analyzing his own path. To discredit it by having his main character basically say that he's a liar and he has no excuse for it was sort of a cop-out and rendered the movie uninteresting at the end. I was totally inspired all the way through the movie, cried a few times even, but at the end, I stopped believing in the wisdom of the movie just the way that the main character did. Too bad. I would have given it 5 stars up until the last 10 minutes. Perhaps there could be a rewrite!",Negative
I love to watch the great ways the chefs come up with new dishes and push the edge of what you expect.  Just wish it was not taken off from prime.,Positive
I enjoy watching this show and watching how the 'pros' do it. The features are also fun to go through.,Positive
"Most of the characters in this series are drips - 2-dimensional, cardboard cut-outs. But Spader as Reddington is just perfect. His lines even seem to be written by a different author. Now, this series is NOT serious film in any sense of the word, but as serial make-believe mystery-cum-spy scenarios - it's a treat. But take Spader out and this thing would flop.",Positive
"I am so hooked on this series. I have told more people about it because it is interesting, educational, entertaining, well written, well acted and awesome.",Positive
"I didn't expect Jeremiah Johnson but this series is so staged that, to me, it's not watchable. Does a mountain man live in a two or three hundred thousand dollar house, travel on paved roads and get regular family visits? I wouldn't have thought so. There is only one of these men who resembles in the least how a mountain man would live. The rest are so faked it completely stultified my credulity. I don't recommend this series at all.",Negative
Excellent!!!,Positive
Awesome! That's all that needs to be said about this series. I can't wait until the next season to begin!,Positive
The show is okay but the new instant video format is horrible.  You can not tell at a glance which shows you have watched and which you have not so you have to go into each one and check it out.  All of my shows are their but not all of my history.  I can not see how it improves my viewing experience at all!!@!!!!!,Negative
"The Troll Hunter or Trolljegeren is a Norwegian monster movie portrayed as if it is real recovered footage of a man who hunts trolls and the student journalists who follow him.  It is written and directed by Andr&eacute; vredal, a name to keep an eye on for sure.  Here is a film that works with a modest budget and takes an absolutely absurd concept and somehow forces it through as realistic a lens as possible.  Sure, it's easy now to just brush off these mokumentary movies as gimmicks, because there have been quite a few of them fromMan Bites DogtoThe Blair Witch Projectand to the more recentQuarantine(or the superior movie[Rec] that it was based on).  There have been misses of course with this method but more often than not its use has been effective in making a scenario seem more authentic and the horror of it all the more compelling and enjoyable.  I'm past believing the mokumentary set-up is hackneyed now.  It seems to me a very legitimate way of making movies seem more real, especially in an age where computerized images dominate big budget Hollywood pictures and unwittingly request that real cinephiles stretch our suspension of disbelief well beyond at least my own comfort zone.  So I'm a proponent of the possibilities of the mokumentary horror film after watching this little gem that contains all the elements to make every frame fun and believable.  It is particularly highlighted by Otto Jespersen's Hans; the film's title role.  His dead pan demeanor and casual actions in bizarrely twisted situations bring a welcome dry humor that had me chuckling regularly as I enjoyed The Troll Hunter.  Jespersen offers up a Bill Murray-like performance in a role that is clearly not written for a comedian, but is most definitely and quite potently delivered by one.  He is terrific in this movie.A group of naive student journalists sets out to track down and document a supposed bear poacher.  This is Hans (Jespersen) and he is very reluctant to respond to their inquiries about his activities.  They follow Hans all over Western Norway until they finally discover what he is really doing.  After they figure this out he lets them follow and film him as he goes about his unique occupation.  The moment when the students know for sure what Hans is really up to will test your imagination or make you laugh hysterically, or maybe even a little bit of both.  At that moment I wasn't really sure what I was watching but I knew one thing; I loved it.The natural performances by the rest of the cast are not to be overlooked.  These are talented young actors that help make the film much more than a simple one trick monster movie.  The Troll Hunter should also be commended for being shot on location in the mountains of Western Norway.  It couldn't have been an easy shoot for anyone but again it lends itself in an attempt to make an off-the-wall concept filmmable and compelling.  I suspect massive international attention for The Troll Hunter soon enough, and it deserves it.  This has cult classic written all over it.",Positive
"Freeman was a straight-A student in science, as a kid, and he brings a genuine passion about the importance of science education.  This series does it right, it discusses problems and solutions, and it interviews real scientists and explains what they do and why it's fun.  Far better than the eye candy of ""The Universe"" series.  This is highly recommended as both entertaining and educational.",Positive
One no more begins feeling sympathy for one of these characters and then you want them wasted. An interesting and nicely non-American approach where characters are a mix of qualities rather than simplistic cartoon. Ciaran Hinds is always interesting and the young detective working with him is equally engaging.,Positive
"While I would probably watch a few more episodes on a rainy afternoon, this series is way too typical of police dramas: smart officer, in trouble; Los Angeles backdrop; telegenic female characters. There is nothing gritty or realistic about it, despite some very decent performances.",Negative
"I initially got my 19 month old son into this show. Not soon after I realized it was quite entertaining for me to watch as well. Great morals, beautifully illustrated, and great writing.",Positive
I find the series really intriguing and can hardly wait for the next episode.I find myself wondering if we still have folks who were in that situation.  How old would they be now and where are they now.,Positive
I'm a romantic... so I wish the ending were different.  Maybe.. just maybe.. if I wish... Amazon will create another episode.... people who didn't come back would... no spoiler... I'm just saying..Very enjoyable pre-teen movie.,Positive
"Why  watch an old.plot line with the same happy ending? Losers become winners in football, in baseball and hockey.Just because you like football. The actors and action isn't half bad. Maybe they'll be a new twist to an old cliche. I'm going to watch just to see how it comes out.",Positive

"Love this show, so glad it was on Amazon Prime for free.  I do not have regular TV, just streaming, so it's nice to catch up.",Positive
"Judi Dench  is absolutely fabulous as usual. All of the main  characters are riveting to watch.  These shows make me wonder what is wrong with Hollywood. The third episode is so funny, I cannot help but laugh  every time I watch it. Francesci  Annis  is a  treet to watch in the dramatic scenes. Thanks for making decent viewing available.",Positive
"Garry Trudeau has to feel pretty good about himself.  Republicans and Tea Partiers are portrayed as hypocritical fools and shills.  This will play well with half the country and not the other half.  Sadly for me, I'm in that other half and have better things to do than get sucker-punched by my entertainment.",Negative

"Once upon a time, Francis Ford Coppola made movies like ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" He also made ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" but that doesn't eclipse his accomplishments.But Francis Ford Coppola clearly has entered the ""I'm going to do whatever I want, even if it makes no sense"" phase in his career. Exhibit A: ""Twixt,"" a baffling little movie that twines together ghosts, vampire bikers, child murder, Edgar Allen Poe and a big messy knot of subplots that may or may not be real.I once tried to summarize ""Twixt"" to an acquaintance, and ended up babbling incoherently about Poe, vampires, ghosts and dead children. But I'll try to tackle it anyway: Second-string horror author Hall Baltimore (Val Kilmer) is touring for his latest novel, and ends up in a small town that doesn't even have a bookstore. That evening, he encounters a strange, ghostly young girl who calls herself ""V"" (Elle Fanning).He soon finds that strange things are afoot in this town -- time seems to be frozen (none of the clock faces move), there is a gang of bikers who may be vampires camped out on the lakeshore, and the ghost of Edgar Allen Poe visits him in his dreams to reveal half-forgotten secrets. And what does all this have to do with the recently-murdered girl lying in the police station?It's really hard to even pass judgement on ""Twixt"" -- it would involve understanding what the director was trying to do... or thinking... or understanding ANYTHING. It feels like Coppola had four or five different ideas for stories (""Vampire bikers! A vampire/ghost orphan! Dream messages from Poe! A failing author with personal issues!""), and so he squashes all of them into one movie.The result feels like a mad hybrid of Stephen King and David Lynch. The small-town setting, the supernatural threats and the eccentric characters feel somewhat like something King would put in a story... but the way it's presented is wildly Lynchian, with giant lumps of misty symbolism and blurred borders between fantasy and reality. You could watch this movie a dozen times, and still not be sure what is happening.For instance, one scene features Baltimore wandering into a blue-lit bar, where he listens to two people who speak in an affected, dreamlike way and occasionally sings ""The Big Rock Candy Mountain."" After one of them attacks V, they babble some more about how the clocks do not work and time cannot be measured... and Baltimore just leaves. Utterly baffling... and no, it is never referred to again.I suspect that Val Kilmer was just as baffled, because that's effectively the performance he gives -- total confusion. He does a decent job with Baltimore's frustration and grief over the problems in his life, but most of the time he's left staring around in confusion. Elle Fanning isn't in much of the movie, but she does do a good job as a girl who may be a ghost, a vampire, a dream, or whatever.But one thing that Coppola does not fail at is making the movie beautiful -- it's a misty, night-hued story that drifts over lakes, through ruined stone walls, through moonlight-dappled forests. Some of the greenscreen is a bit obvious, but it doesn't distract from the hauntingly lovely, surreal visuals that fill most of the movie.Francis Ford Coppola has become the elderly winemaking version of people who make amateur horror shorts and put them up on youtube. ""Twixt"" is utterly baffling and bizarre, but at least it's a pretty kind of baffling/bizarre.",Negative
we watched all the seasons through Amazon and now we are caught up for the new season. I just hope they do not end it.. Great series..,Positive
I have been watching this since Season 1. I love how they struggle to keep themselves alive and still face adversaries from within groups.,Positive
awesome new series.  you can now watch directly on ABC and not have to pay a cent!  Good way to catch up though.,Positive
"This movie is the example of why you should have a strong outline plot, it's seems pasted together to a degree. However the editor managed to actually come up with a story here. Giant creatures that look like  walking octopusses! are taking over parts of mexico and two people must travel through the infected zone to get back to the United States. That's the story although it was the editor and director who finally figured this out I guess. The effects look great though! Which shows even a low budget movie these days CAN look fantastic unlike the low budget movies of yesteryear who had no cgi effects. THat being said I am sure many people were not happy that the movie is all taking place in jungle territory and northern mexico is all desert and mountains! The movie was shot in Guatelmala which is all jungle. Ok, the acting is fine and these days you can make a fine movie with limited equipment. No giant screens to block sunlight and such but still having no script and no idea what you want is not the best way to make a movie. This however turned out to be a an ok low budget movie with really good special effects. Like I said ten years ago the effects at this budget would have been at a far different level.  The blu ray looks great and you get lots of extras too.  So I would say that if you rent this one you'll be happy enough with it. I think the one star reviewers would probably hate all the really old sci fi movies out there so ignore em.",Negative

"Enjoyed watching these obese people make the necessary changes in their lives. It was amazing to see not only the physical changes, but the way their whole attitude changed toward life. The sparkle in their eyes and their determination gives me no doubt that they will succeed. Wonderful weight loss experience done right! Looking forward for Season 2 to be available on Prime.",Positive
This is actually a really good movie it looks at what drives a religion. It is like wow I would so do this. It is a must see .,Positive
"I like the show a lot, and the game is also really good.  It is definitely different, I am really happy it is renewed for a second season.",Positive
"It's not going to win an Oscar for drama, comedy or writing, but it's a good story to pass the night away with a loved one or if you want a good laugh.  I would definitely recommend to all but a film critic looking for depth.",Positive
"As a western conservative Republican... ""I approve of this video"".  Amazon... you have to bring us more. Keep John Goodman in it, it's a must.",Positive
"The premise is good.  The acting could be better.  And really, why all the swearing?  Good writing and acting really doesn't need to rely on swearing to get through a show.  Even with all that, it had me hooked, I had to watch to find out what was going on.  I would continue to watch hoping the acting got better, just to find out where this story goes.  The creature/alien at the end was cool!",Positive
"I think the first two seasons are my favorites by far.  There are some excellent moments in Season three; however, I think it became more of a drama than what it had been in the previous two seasons.  Unlike Babylon 5, it is clear that Battlestar didn't have an overarching direction.  Great writing, but....",Negative
"Love the series. Wish it were not HD. The extra data, which frankly, I don't see any difference, makes the video occasionally stumble. If it were regular instead of HD, I wouldn't get audio and video &#34;glitches&#34;.",Positive
"Quite charming except from a completely different era than I could relate to.  In the '6os we did it minus lap top/cell phone or even craigslist.  Our wanderings never went as flawlessly, but we still encountered kindness & had a lot more fun than Joe.  Kerouac did it best in the '50s.  The beatnik of all time wrote a book - not a silly semi-documentary movie.  Am having trouble adjusting to this current world...",Negative
I wanted to watch season 6 to get caught up in this series. I held off getting into this show because I thought it would be too hard and time consuming to catch up. Not hard at all. The characters really develop over time. Doctor 11 is fun and wonderful. Great stories if you love scifi and fantasy all rolled in one.,Positive
"LIFE ITSELF is touching, funny, informative and often difficult to watch, and it offers an unflinching glimpse into Roger Ebert's life. Everything is discussed, from his early life as a newspaper editor all the way up to the medical issues he encountered during his last years. However, what I found most interesting was the discussion of his alcoholism, which I wasn't aware of before watching this. I already knew a lot of the stuff regarding his show with Gene Siskel. Still, it was nice to get more background and see it all in the context of his career, and the fantastic insight into his and Siskel's spirited professional relationship. I'm almost hesitant at writing a review of this in the first place, but I do feel like this was a very poignant documentary which serves as a fitting epitaph to one of the giants of film criticism.",Positive
It was alright not horrible.,Negative
I watch primarily for the sight of Ciaran Hinds and find Kelly Reilly distracting (I like her better as Mrs. Watson). Somehow this plot did not come together for me.,Negative
"I've watched every Viking episode many times and have enjoyed every single one. However, Season 2 Episode 5 is the best so far! Lagertha takes the show by storm and is key in the resolution of several story lines. I can't wait to see what comes next in this imaginative yet viably historical series.",Positive
"H2O reminded me of Flipper and Gidget from the 1960s.  The plots ran to sibling rivalry, fights with each other and boyfriends, misunderstandings, embarrassments, and the joy of swimming and playing in the water. Must see for teens who like fantasy, The scenery is beautiful.  The costumes superb.  Some of the special effects are silly, but easily overlooked.",Positive
"Tim Allen's new show definitely has the Home Improvement appeal, however it's much, MUCH more funny!  I don't think I have laughed so much since I watched Mike and Molly!  This was just the first episode and they just keep getting funnier and funnier!  Watch the entire season, it's completely worth it!",Positive
"You can always learn something from Julia.  It doesn't matter if you're just teaching yourself to cook or if you're an old hand in the kitchen, watching Julia Child is always a fun way to learn something new about food.",Positive
I have enjoyed watching the first and now second seasons of Arrow.  It is definitely the story line and acting of a comic book come alive!  .,Positive
"if I was a millionaire i would single handedly  keep funding this show.. i have no clue why anyone would dislike it.. it has everything. and the acting is great, makeup is great,etc...",Positive
"Bring it on Amazon, and make it soon. Superbly acted and written. I have not read any of the books, but this was a great show. This should be given more episodes, and soon. Please dont make us wait for the series to get underway. Cherry on top was Scott Wilson. Credibility meter went off the charts when I saw him in this. Okay, so when is the next episode?",Positive
I've enjoyed the show quite a lot since it started even if it is a bit slow at times.  I like the new take on the character-he poses as a rich American businessman living in London as a cover for his war against the group that cursed him and made him a vampire. I hope the show will be picked up for a second season.,Positive
"Very well played by an excellent cast. The message of the production, however, is probably prophetic and thus frightening. We are already very close to that nightmare scenario, as witnessed by recent events. Whether by government or mega-corporation, we are already being manipulated.",Positive
I've seen every episode of the big bang theory maybe 100 times.  It's still funny.  Season 7 is a great one.,Positive
"Plus Malcolm MacDowell and a cast of young, sexy actors and actresses. What's not to like? Did I mention sex?",Positive
"I so regret that this series lasted for only 18 episodes and soon will no longer be available for streaming via Amazon Prime. I'm male and probably not in the demographic for this type of show. However, I thoroughly enjoyed at. It was funny, thoughtful and filled with characters you could be interested in. Hopefully, there will be more room on TV for these types of shows in the future and less given over to mindless, derivative violence.",Positive
"The Shield: Season Sixwas Shawn Ryan's real farewell to his ne'er do well Strike Team: when Shane (Walton Goggins) puts a grenade in Curtis Lemansky's (Kenny Johnson) lap out of fear he may be an informant, it's all grisly cliffnotes from thereon out. The demented, righteous and corrupt Lt. Kavanaugh (played uncomfortably well by Forrest Whitaker) succeeds with the help of Acevada to put Lemansky in a position that is completely untenable: go to jail and possibly be killed by Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson) or flee to Mexico and face the same fate as Vic's semi mentor, Ben Gilroy.We see Vic's psyche begin to defenstrate as he can find neither rhyme nor reason to Lemansky's sudden Salvadoran gang style death, and boy, when Vic's psyche begins to defenestrate, EVERYONE'S in trouble.  His ability to lie and delude himself to satisfy his own emotions--in this case, revenge--is demonstrated to such a terrifying pitch by Michael Chiklis that one cannot help but wonder why Ronnie Gardocki (David Rees Snell) didn't become his own man in time.Lemansky was the glowing nucleus of the Strike Team, the man with ethics enough to keep Vic and Shane's putrid souls alive with some measure of joy and balance them out a bit.  What is worse than his grisly death, perhaps, is the discovery that another Strike Team member did it.  Dutch begins to come into his own as the Team fades, and since it's now only three people, Claudette gets more leverage.The introduction of Kevin Hiatt onto the team shows what *might have been* if Claudette herself was not corrupt--since Vic is on the verge of losing his badge, she could have hired him as the head of the Strike Team, but she chooses Vic because of his animalistic street smarts.  Never once was this show boring; never once monotonous; every episode blisters with meaning, commentaries on the human condition and everything else within a very short time frame, which is why I rank it as superior to the Sopranos and The Wire.",Positive
"Unique, exciting, provocative series.",Positive
I have enjoyed season one and only regret that season two is not on prime as yet....  I still won't pay  up to $1.99 per ep of any shows..  Maybe I have to wait another year... lol,Positive
Funny and believable! This season has good continuing character development and I'm glad to see more realistic plots (not so many &#34;Lucy & Ethel&#34; scenarios).,Positive
"I am enjoying the series.  Well written and well acted, but stretches the imagination.  Nice babes! Definitely not for kids & teens.",Positive
"I have watched all the Seasons of The Glade and think that the Series is fantastic. One gets to know the characters and therefore empathize with them.  I liked the fact that the show had mystery and was fast paced but did not need coarse language, violence or inappropriate sex to keep one interested and looking forward to the next episode.  The main characters were moral and exhibited self control.  The character of Detective jim Longworth is strong, with an ability to think outside the box, thereby invariably identifying the killer.  His sense of humor keeps adds a valuable dimension to each story. I can't understand why there will not be a season 5 - how could we be left with such an ending!",Positive
"Love, love this show. It is really funny especially like the gang tries to win an award and mac day.",Positive
"This devious little thriller simply *must* be seen. But you should know what you're NOT getting, in order to avoid disappointment.I had seen only the trailer and good reviews on Amazon. I was expecting more of an action-y British gangster film. But it's not really an action film -- although MUCH happens -- and that's a *good* thing. It is devilishly suspenseful.The first ten minutes are masterful. They quickly becoming horrifyingly suspenseful -- totally without dialogue. (The first line of dialogue is said at approx 6 min in.) That sounds boring, but it is the exact opposite: riveting. The story begins, and you must pay attention. The more attention you pay, the more compelling it becomes. This is *not* a movie to have on in the background while you clear off the kitchen table or do dishes. (My boyfriend does this all the time. It drives me nuts because he'll say, ""Eh, I didn't think [insert movie title] was that good"" and I'll say, ""Well, you really didn't watch it, you mostly had your back to it!"" And then when I make him sit down and watch movies I've liked, he'll say, ""I totally didn't get that the first time I saw it"" and I'm like, ""Yeah, 'cause you didn't *see* it!!"" Argh.)This is a movie to make popcorn for and sit down to really *watch* -- don't answer your phone, don't play with your tablet, make sure any kids are in bed and can't disturb you.The actions of the two men in preparation to commit a serious crime heighten the suspense. The supplies they gather are curious, then intriguing, then horrifying in their implications. The spaces in which they work are large with wide camera angles. Over time, throughout the film, both the spaces and camera angles slowly shrink, adding a visual claustrophobia to the psychological tension as the film progresses.The soundtrack is like a fourth character (and I'd like to buy it). It never gives things away, but alternates setting the mood with punctuating the plot twists and shifting dynamics. Pure music -- synthesizer-based modern sounds alternating with haunting organic notes of solo viola or cello -- evokes moods and heightens the emotion of unexpected twists, moments of pathos, shifts of alliance. It doesn't use pop music to buttress lousy chemistry or muddy action.This movie is not what the trailer implies. Truly unexpected plot twists alternate with slow reveals of the relationship dynamics, character back-stories (without flashbacks), and shifting alliances. Every time I thought I knew what would happen, who the characters were, what they were about to do -- I was wrong. As a jaded and cynical movie fan, and tired of predictable, cliche-ish, dumbed down movies, I found this movie fiendishly fun to try to figure out -- and I never really succeeded.Gemma Arterton's Alice is integral to the plot. She does a great job, she definitely holds her own -- but she by no means carries the film by herself, as the Amazon summary says. It's truly an ensemble, albeit a small one of only three people. The two male leads were gripping to watch. Eddie Marsan is amazing as Vic. (He was Inspector Lestrade from Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes reboots; he was also in two of the Channel 4 Red Ridings, and in the BBC's Little Dorrit). Vic's evolution is unexpected, believable, brilliantly done, and (by the end) surprisingly sympathetic. Martin Compston was new to me (I never watched Monarch of the Glen). But he's fantastic as the (initially) inexplicably conflicted Danny, seemingly one-down in the criminal partnership. In fact, the acting by both male leads is so good, your sympathy shifts back and forth from the obviously sympathetic victim character Alice to the two males, who initially are totally unsympathetic (because you think you know who they are and what they're about to do).The Disappearance of Alice Creed is not a ""big"" film with crashing violence and lots of guns and explosions. It's one of those films where the implied violence is almost as devastating as the violence that *is* committed. Like David Cronenberg's films, when violence or action occurs in this film, it *means* something: it has consequences -- it's not just there for vicarious and bloodless audience thrills. And although this movie fraks with you, it's not a conventional mind-frak movie, either. It's definitely a psychological thriller.Don't view this movie expecting Sexy Beast or In Bruges or a Guy Ritchie movie -- or even Layer Cake, with which it has some kinship psychologically and perhaps morally (but it never tries to be as consciously cool as Layer Cake). The Disappearance of Alice Creed has more in common thematically with the Coen Brothers' Blood Simple or No Country For Old Men, or with Carl Franklin's thriller One False Move. It's deadly serious about itself and that pays off in how unique and authentic the plot and characters feel. It's up to you whether you find the ending uplifting or bleak, a morality tale or an inevitability.WARNING: Stick through the first half hour/forty minutes, even if it looks/feels like it's about to become cheap Hollywood torture porn. It isn't. It's a much better and smarter film than that. By smart, I do not mean clever like a Guy Ritchie film is clever. (Not that there is anything wrong with that: I love Ritchie's films.) I mean, the entire thing could have easily been B-movie material -- but the script, the directing, the acting, and the execution elevate it way above a B-movie.There is a lot of female nudity, but I did not find it gratuitous (there's also a good amount of corresponding male nudity, under different circumstances). It's typically British matter-of-fact nudity. The female nudity serves the plot and heightens the vulnerability of the victim, but, as a woman, I found it to be as tastefully done as possible under the circumstances. If this had been made in Hollywood, the nudity would have been far greater, far more gratuitous, and much more like B-movie torture-porn. Fortunately, it wasn't made in Hollywood -- one of the reasons why it's so good.In a completely unintentional way I'm sure, I almost find The Disappearance of Alice Creed to thumb its nose at your average Hollywood thriller. It shows how good a movie can be when you focus on script, plot, acting, and direction -- to the exclusion of focusing on butts-in-seats and opening weekends, or trying to tweak those with focus groups and test screenings.The DVD extras are decent. Haven't listened to the commentaries yet, but the dual-screen comparison of the storyboards with the actual film was interesting and shows how well they adhered to the original visual conception. The outtakes are funny moments of the actors forgetting their lines or being unable to get past a fit of giggles (the guys, surprisingly). I watched the outtakes mostly to assure myself that nothing really bad happened to any of the actors -- that's how authentic and compelling the plot and characters are! I feel silly admitting that, but the first third of the movie is rather knuckle-whitening to sit through, especially as a woman -- you really fear the worst for Alice.Also: as with many British films, I had to watch it the first time with the subtitles on, or I wouldn't have understand some of the dialogue. I recommend this to non-British viewers unfamiliar with the accents of various parts of the UK. My second and third viewings, I didn't need the subtitles. (You won't get many subtitles for the first ten minutes, because there is no dialogue.)",Positive
"watched it until the end but the jones town references were hard to stomach at times.  Our fearless leader is hardly a force for good as he proclaims of course, but we never really learn why people feel obliged to stick with him even after things go haywire.

Worth a watch if you're bored and like movies about cults.",Negative

"Dollhouse is a must-buy for any fan of Buffy, Angel, and/or Firefly/Serenity. The common demominator is, of course, Joss Whedon. Dollhouse, as his other creations, is like nothing else on TV. He has given us interesting and certainly flawed, yet appealing characters, and the stories keep us entertained and wishing for more.But the star of the show is Eliza Dushku. Every episode she plays a different character. Her main one is named Echo, but for the majority of the story she is someone else. Sometimes she is brainy and nonviolent, and sometimes she has to kick a little ass (and for us Faith fans, this is what we wait for!).The supporting characters are very good. They add layers to this show which are complicated, and sometimes they are not so nice, but they only add color and excitement to the episodes.The DVD set contains the unaired pilot, which, in my opinion was every bit as good as the one that WAS aired. And there is the unaired episode ""Epitaph One"" which can only be seen on this set. It was very good, but the ending left me with more questions than answers.This DVD set is well worth the money (which is very reasonable to begin with) and I would reccommend it to those who may not be Joss Whedon fans (or even those who may not know who he is).",Positive
"I am ashamed to say that I haven't read this novel, but the series was fantastic!!.  The plot twists and surprises were sometimes expected and sometimes not...but always great.  I wanted the joy of reading this Charles Dickens novel, so I bought the Kindle edition to read. I can't wait.",Positive
"Look I watch allot of shows and movies. Breaking Bad, Walking Dead are as good as it gets 5 star. Then you have really good shows that are not historical in their greatness but have good entertainment and action value. Revolution is one of those shows. It is apocolyptic which I look for in shows like Walking Dead has some good story lines and action. Also good looking women does not hurt (unlike Breaking Bad) add this to your rotation if you like adventure, drama, action and some sci fi elements. Jericho would be a similar type of comparison",Positive
I guess it could of been ok... I really don't know because the beginning did not interest me and therefore...I feel asleep on it.,Negative
"There's just something about lance henriksen's work for years and years that attracts me..Even enjoyed his television work on series 'Millennium&#34;., which i didn't always GET, but it did provide a different sort of t.v.programing...On a whim, bought this second hand online for rainy day entertainment,when ive read all my books...(yup,it's true..no KINDLE.).Still luv lance's gravelly,smoke weary voice and that face that carries deep grooves,..but thats about it..Don't believe i finished watching it..Gave up..What the hell is that crap stalking the woods???Why oh why, must movie people throw in those endless flashbacks of a beautiful,mysterious girl, laughing, twirling ,running her perfect face,skinny butt, through fields of flowers???After having viewed thousands of movies in time, this is an immediate turn off.~~~~Of course, we realize early on,she's going to have to pay the price....Ah, well, if your a newbie to film, or very young, u might like this sorta thing, some grisly moments newbies might enjoy and then of course a little sex strewn about,which im not opposed to...but all in all, not for me. It was juvenile...Instead look up some of lances's old work, like in ALIEN;or theres a movie he made years ago where he is part of a marauding bunch of vamps, that is down and dirty, AND thoroughly enjoyable...What was it's name?...darn it...sometimes menopause sucks.",Negative
"The characters are acted well enough, but their statements are lame.  Subplots are set in motion weakly.  For example, one character who has been dead for a year (in limbo) comes back to life and sees someone from her former life and therefore that person just dies.  Well, okay, I can go along with that.  But then, she decides she has to go to his funeral where she will see other people who think she is dead.  Okay.  A character is selfish and irrational.  Maybe, being dead did that to her.  Problem is, the writing that gives thrust to each mini-plot seems contrived.  Okay stuff for the treadmill",Negative
I viewed this show on a suggestion from someone and was surprised.It Is different from what I thought and probably won't last long.,Negative
"This review was written only after having watched the pilot.The Blacklist has been set up as a mashup of Silence of the Lambs and Alias. We get creepy genius criminal-in-custody James Spader (a la Hannibal Lecter) insisting on spilling what he knows only to a young female FBI ingenue with this one being a much prettier alternative to Jodie Foster.  The interplay is similar but with the added component that Spader already knows all about her, a likely set up to his secretly being her father. (Shades of Star Wars)But Silence of the Lambs was done in 1991.  A knock off like this would feel more relevant if it had been done 20 years ago. As it is now, it feels old and stale.  The next component is the TV show Alias starring Jennifer Garner as done by JJ Abrams with a kick-ass female trying to integrate her exciting government agent life with her everyday family life, plus the turns and twists of the girl's personal relationships and people not being who they seem.  Alias debuted in 2001 so at least we're getting closer. This part of the concept is *only* a dozen years gone by.The show is watchable in part because of the casting of the two leads, James Spader and Megan Boone is fair. And it will probably be considered a hit, but mostly because of how dumb and awful most network TV is.  You'll have to suspend your disbelief mightily though with regards to this portrayal of the inner workings of the FBI which looks and feels fake...another thing it has in common with that old trod ground called Alias. And notably the casting of Harry Lennix as the guy-in-charge at the FBI doesn't ring true but it does follow the current New State Religion where TV and movie fiction goes out of its way to cast black actors in positions of authority in which they never are in real life.",Negative
"I did watch all six episodes, and I probably will watch more if they make more. That main scientist shown in the picture is very annoying, I must say. As viewers we are somehow expected to believe that he knows more than he's revealing, but he just seems to be too contrived. The show reminds me somewhat of Flash Forward, but it doesn't come close in quality or scope.",Negative
"I wanted to like this film, we don't always get what we want. The cinematography was just so poor, under lit to the point I couldn't see who was talking or what was happening. Dark bars and night scenes can be shot so that you can still see the action but that requires skill and knowledge that was not evident here. Then there is the audio, it sounds as though the microphones were wrapped in wool. Muffled dialogue in the dark gets real annoying in a very short while, especially when the local accent and colloquialisms are already a challenge to understand. I was beginning to wish for subtitles. So much for the technicalities. The direction was just as poor. the pace of this film went from a fast walk to an agonizing limp then fell to the ground and crawled..slowly, painfully. I really don't care to see another scene in another film where our hero  character announces ""I'm an alcoholic"" at an AA meeting then goes out and sucks down a fifth of booze  straight from the bottle in between lines of anger and self pity! Can you say cliche! The comic relief was..oh that's right there was none. I hate to pick on child actors so I am glad to say there isn't one in this film. The young girl in this film sounded like she was reading and pretending. The woman playing Ondine, Alicja Bachleda, was sublime throughout. She was a living breathing complex creature on many levels. Colin was flat, a character without energy or dimension. I finally decided my evening would be more pleasantly spent trying to breath through a wet towel. Two stars, one for Alicja and one for what might have been.",Negative
"I like the fact that the stories are taken from records, diaries, and other memorabilia. The costuming and scenery make it very authentic. The scripts are good and the acting is good! Well spent time in front of the television!",Positive
"This review is for the Mythbusters ""Curving Bullets"" episode. I was disapointed when I missed this episode on cable, so was happy to find it on-demand.The myths covered here are the Curving Bullets as found hereWanted (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)(with Kari *very pregnant*, Grant, and Tory) and Sonic Boom Braking Glass (with Jamie and Adam).As usual, there is a good amount of humor in each of the segments and you can tell that they enjoyed shooting (pun intended) this firearm heavy episode. It was also great seeing the Blue Angel jets in the Sonic Boom episode.I will not say what the results were for these two, but it was a very enjoyable episode.Highly Recommended!",Positive
This season started out good and then it to me just kinda got boring. Not sure what happen there. ?,Positive

These episodes are some of the best of the David Tennant Doctor Who series.  I love all the cheeky humor.,Positive
"Parts of his performance made me cringe they we so awful. He's a terrific actor, so I don't know what was happening here. He didn't have chemistry with any of the cast and the whole thing seemed awkward and forced. Pilots can be a little rough around the edges, so maybe this will get better with time. Overall, I'm didn't like it enough to make it 'appointment' TV.",Negative
"This series is so edgy, the acting is terrific. The history of the 80's is so interesting. I can't wait for the next season to start",Positive
"I'll admit, it's a guilty pleasure watching Ramsey go Full Metal Jacket each week on a bunch of chefs who continuously screw up cooking scallops, Beef Wellingtons and halibut. It should be repetitive and nauseating but it's really not. I find myself compelled to watch episode after episode of Ramsey berating and screaming at the contestants while learning very little about food along the way.Here are some of the things I did learn from this season include:- Don't overcook scallops. They get rubbery.- Don't under cook fish. You'll get screamed at.- Communicate with your team even though you're competing against them.- Don't lie to Ramsey. You'll get screamed at.- Take up smoking if you plan to appear on this show.Although I experienced this season on Amazon streaming, one of the bonuses of the DVD version is that it's uncensored so you can experience the full filth of the insults. Long time fans know that the guy bleeping out Chef Gordon has the hardest job in television and he's given a blissful reprieve on the boxed sets. Otherwise this season features some imaginative challenges, punishments and rewards and while it's more focused and extreme than previous years, it's basically more of the same. Which is exactly what the fans need.",Positive
to the previous seasons. It has charm. It is sort of like a good homemade soup of a tv show.,Positive
"The pilot was fresh and funny, a cool take on 4 Republican congressmen who live together in an ""Alpha House"" because they are low on funds.  I thought it was great because I am cynical--I don't think most politicians believe the garbage they say in speeches to get elected.  These guys definitely are drifters in the wind of public opinion.  Any show that has John Goodman as the star must be greenlit for a full series.  Goodman can deliver lines with more gusto than anyone, I'd love to see more of him.  Clark Johnson was also very good, I was surprised and pleased to see him in the role, as he has usually been a director for many years since Homicide.  The big surprise for me was how much I enjoyed Mark Consuelos' roguish & funny character, he could be the breakout star of this show, much in the way that Kim Cattrall was on Sex in the City.  I hope this does become a regular series.",Positive
"Starts off like every other lost footage tape, happy, clueless, American family camping in the open feilds,.. when they see strange lights....then the movie turns into a cheep hand held camera version, of a wanna be (PREDATOR) without a hero...and notfornuthin...project bluebook was dismantled in 1968...so there true story, statements are at best missleading that this  was a real mufon case file....not so.....well it was a good atempt..the writers should have done better reserch ...but if your in to alien movies??You will not learn anything new or see any great special effects...Lame attempt at what could have been a really intresting thriller,....the producers just should have have done better reserch***",Negative
This is a fun show with so many twists and turns it stays entertaining all season because you never know what to expect.,Positive
I absolutely love this show. Travis Fimmel is doing a great job playing Ragnar Lothbrok. Thank you History Channel for another great series.,Positive

"I do so love a good Apocalypse.  No, it isn&#8217;t only the visuals.  No, it isn&#8217;t only the inevitable fall of man.  What makes an Apocalypse worth viewing &#8211; so far as I&#8217;m concerned &#8211; is the central focus on good, believable human characters.  Whether the end of mankind is caused by a nuclear war or some planet-smashing asteroid or even some biologic concoction the story still has to be populated with people an audience can care about.  That&#8217;s something so many creative folks tend to leave out as they grow more and more distracted in trying to amp up their visuals &#8230; when all you need is a John and a Sally and a little kid or a wayward stray dog to give the story its emotional foundation.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;Marc has been trapped inside his Barcelona office for three months.  Outside, the world has plunged into chaos following the outbreak of a fatal type agoraphobia known as The Panic, which kills anyone who ventures outdoors.  Desperate to tunnel out in order to try to find his girlfriend, Marc makes a tense alliance with Enrique, a coworker who has a rare, functioning GPS.  Equipped with only minimal supplies and a desperate need to escape, the two embark on a journey through the lawless, hostile subway tunnels and sewers in search of their loved ones.&#8221;Though some might disagree, what works best about THE LAST DAYS is the balance on human characters at its heart.  Marc (as played by Quim Gutierrez) isn&#8217;t anything special; he&#8217;s just an average man &#8211; one who appears to be destined to be fired for his inability to get his company&#8217;s latest firewall to properly work.  The last time he saw his lovely girlfriend Julia (Marta Etura), he snapped at her because of the stress he&#8217;s feeling.  He could be the guy riding next to you on the bus or the train, or he could be the guy sitting in the cubicle right around the corner from you.Similarly, Enrique (Jose Coronado) is the run-on-the-mill Human Resources representative.  He&#8217;s smartly dressed.  He&#8217;s the consummate professional.  However, he does have a reputation &#8211; one definitely earned &#8211; of being a bit heartless as one of his central tasks is to fire employees who are underperforming.  No one wants to be called into his office.  No one wants to share a meal at his table.  His is a dark, foreboding presence &#8211; one that spells corporate doom &#8211; putting him in the position to be avoided like the plague.What happens when a real plague hits the planet?Marc and Enrique quickly become the unlikeliest allies, thrown together out of the dire condition of their circumstances.  While their professional relationship was built on the premise of slightly misinforming one another, their personal &#8216;working friendship&#8217; starts out much the same.  Once they discover how far the world outside has slipped into lawless chaos, they&#8217;re forced to set aside those differences &#8211; however unpleasant that may be to them personally &#8211; in order to work together at accomplishing what steps must be taken to reunite them with their respective families.The writing/director team of Alex and David Pastor have crafted an impressive film exploring what could be the most unlikely end of days to have come along since 2011&#8217;s equally sublime PERFECT SENSE &#8230; except this one doesn&#8217;t end up as dire as that.  Hoisted onto the shoulders of its everyman characters, THE LAST DAYS never loses sight of the human faces stuck into every frame: they&#8217;re all a bit stressed, and they&#8217;re all necessarily grayed from the dirt and dust of their everyday lives, but their eyes are always focused, concerned, and full of life itself.  Also, their script effectively toys with how contemporary medicine seems to have lost the ability to succinctly define what&#8217;s ailing civilization (the curiously named &#8216;The Panic&#8217; is never given an origin, nor is one necessarily needed for the purposes of the tale) much less offer up anything by way of a cure.  Instead, the sufferers are left to realize that science can&#8217;t even begin to understand why present-day man medically rejects his environment.  All that matters is that he does &#8230; and, now, mankind will have to figure out how to live with itself once again.THE LAST DAYS (2013) is produced by Morena Films, Antena 3 Films, Rebelion Terrestre, and a host of other partners (you can see a complete list at IMDB.com if you&#8217;re interested).  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group under the IFC Midnight label.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Spanish-spoken-language film with English subtitles available.  (There is no English-dubbed track.)  As for the technical specifications?  This is one smartly shot film with the highest quality sights and sounds accompanying.  Lastly, if you&#8217;re looking for special features, then get ready for the shock: there aren&#8217;t any, save for the theatrical trailer.  A big disappointment.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  If you like Apocalypse-themed films even half-as-much as I do, then you&#8217;ll probably find yourself pretty darn excited over what goes down in THE LAST DAYS.  Granted, not all questions are answered &#8211; sometimes, half the fun to appreciating the end times is trying to figure out precisely what went wrong &#8211; but that&#8217;s a small quip to overlook when you&#8217;re treated up to stories this intelligently conceived and visually inspired.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD copy of THE LAST DAYS by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",Positive
"My wife and I really like this show and consider Holmes and Watson to be very well portrayed.  It's especially interesting that Holmes, brilliant as he is, is such a vulnerable, and I guess, all-too-human, figure, an unusual thing given his soaring intellect and obviously well-honed perception.",Positive
"Yeah, well, I have no idea what I just watched.  It was like a drunken conversation come to life.  A monster who looks like he escaped from an 80's horror flick like Ghoulies or Troll crawls out of a guy's ass--literally--and kills people who may bring the guy harm or undue stress.First, thank GOD Michael Bay did not make this film.  The plot is up his alley, but I think no one would be able to take his obsession with explosions.  If you get me.Secondly, I have no idea why you might WANT to watch this movie.  You have to be REALLY bored, 12 years old, or just love butt horror.  (Is that a genre now?)Here's why:I love a couple of the cast, so I thought it might be funny.  Unfortunately, it is just slow and silly.  What is funny is that the acting is pretty great!  I guess, if it had been written well, Bad Milo might have been a comedic hit.Instead it is a smirk-fest.  It gets old fast.Give it a try if you love offbeat comedy.  I wanted to like it, but it was just plain dull.",Negative
"I tried three times to watch this series, but I cannot get past the first episode, where the main characters (who remember, we are all supposed to be able to relate to)lie, cheat, steal, assault, bilk, pilfer, pickpocket, participate in vehicular homicide and then escape to a life of the super-rich. No, they all should have just been caught, arrested, tried and thrown in prison, end of series.I love Eddie Izzard as a comedian and as an actor, but this series simply crosses my ethical lines; you do not make heroes out of villains, you just don't send that message to the world, unless you make it clear that what you are promoting and supporting and suggesting EVIL as a justified way of life. Just because they are part of an even worse criminal element, that does not forgive them for their actions, which they never have to face, that does not give the producers the right to present an upside-down morality play as if it were OK to just kill someone, take over their life, impersonate them, and go about your business as if nothing evil happened, or that it wasn't your fault.So I'll just prop the soapbox up over here and quietly walk away, while you figure out why you want to watch bad people get away with bad things.",Negative
"Not much in the world of entertainment lasts for more than a month or two today in this society, with a thirst that never ends for more and more trash by a people that wouldn't know good from bad if it landed on their heads. This show is still making us laugh and bringing fun in our lives some 60 years later and not missed a beat. Thanks so much for so many laughs.",Positive
"This review duplicates the one I wrote for Revenge. I love this show and I love being able to watch it commercial free. I've given up expensive TV cable/dish providers. I stream Netflix, Amazon, and other free channels with my Roku device and laptop. I dread the day our internet charges sky rocket because the cable/dish providers start noticing the money they are losing because of streaming.",Positive
"I dont get Showtime so the only time I got to see this series was when they were running a promo over a weekend and I finally got to see the show. I ll be honest, I had no interest in the show. It sounded like yet another 'risque' show and it didnt sound that interesting but I was wrong. I caught the last ten minutes of an episode and that was more than enough. I went to iTunes and one by one, I bought the entire first season. Yes, it is very honest and holds no punches and has tons of sex but it is also the best written show ive seen this past year. It is never dull and has some very shocking, and hilarious, moments throughout. This is strictly for adults, though, and that is no exaggeration.I would give Emmys to the show, to Duchovny, to McElhone (who recently lost her husband, my sympathies to her and her family) and the writers and some supporting nods.If you dont mind frank talk, then you will love this show.",Positive
"First off, walking dead, breaking bad, spartacus are awesome 5 star shows. Then you have the b class and lower. This was enjoyable for me the first season, the 2nd especially the superhero girls etc just started getting tired and over the top. I lump this in with SleepyHollow, cant even make it through the first season even though I already paid for it. I will say I am still watching revolution though and it keeps my interest. I am done watching the arrow even though you can catch free episodes. This is just how it goes for most shows, only a few can be good or great",Negative
"Great educational show that captivates both my 4 year old and 2 year old. It's a show that I don't mind watching with them, which is rare. Love it.",Positive
I love this more adult spinoff version from Vampire Diaries.  The writing is terrific!  And the casting is just right too!,Positive
"I found myself becoming more interested as the plot lines evolved. The new show has brought in more technology than the original series, while keeping the theme similar. This version is darker and has more edge than the first series. The younger sister started out slightly shallow, but the need of having her watched by older adults was addressed early on in the series Now I think that both ""sisters"" are developing their sibling roles nicely. The actors that support Michelle Ryan have developed into a fine ensemble of people. I would like to see more of Mark Sheppard in future episodes. There are also danglers of plot in each episode. I hope the show continues. It has turned out to be a show I look forward to watching on my PC.",Positive
"I like season 2 a lot. 8/10. Plus Walton Goggins is still amazing as Boyd. Just for his plot line alone I feel the hours of my life spent on this show have been, well - Justified. Sorry...",Positive

"Samantha (Najarra Townsend) part time lesbian and drug user gets slipped a roofie at a party and has unprotected car sex. The next few days, Sam gets progressively worse as she seems to have the worse STD on the planet. The story is about her getting sick and attempting to cope with life while trying to conceal an illness. I kept waiting for an alien to pop out of her and all I got were maggots.The disease was never explained. I thought Ms. Townsend did an excellent job and I would love to see her in something that has a plot worth watching. The plot ran around in circles and never went anywhere until the end when it got silly.Written, produced, and directed by Eric England.  Works as a rental. Don't expect horror. More of a drama/thriller.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex. Brief male rear nudity.",Negative
A good detective/police stories of a very small Ireland country city. Good look at the Ireland cost-land and country side.,Positive
This is just a fantastic series and Season 4 has been the best so far. They've taken a fairly good character created by Elmore Leonard and developed it into one of the most interesting and engaging characters on television today.,Positive
"This is a predictable show, but very entertaining, nonetheless.  The hero is believable, the plots interesting, and the relationships not too convoluted.  The only thing about the actors, is that everyone of them is quite attractive.  In the real world we are not all so beautiful.  I do appreciate that the hero calls people out on their character flaws.",Positive
Season number 2 just as delightful to watch as the first.  Just the right amount of suspense to get to keep coming back.,Positive
great show... really neat to watch the story unfold..no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!,Positive

Was a fan of several series in the 80's Dallas being one of them.  Enjoy the new cast and this last episode was a nail bitter.  Can hardly wait for the outcome next week.  Thanks for keeping the storyline intriguing.  Have one great idea for a future storyline but no idea whom to write to.  Will see if I can find an address online.  Thanks to all involved with this show.,Positive
"""Glee: Season 1"" is an exceptional show. ""Glee"" is a high school drama, soap opera, and comedy about the agony and the ecstasy of being a teenager, with great music. Although the show has rapid fire broad comedy and classic pop songs, at its core is a group of sympathetic misfits that pull on your heartstrings. ""Glee"" is closer to being ""Freaks & Geeks"" than it is ""The O.C."". Though there is a lot of soap opera melodrama, like ""Ugly Betty"", this is no vacuous teen drama about pretty rich kids, but neither is it a fringe curiosity. ""Glee"" is about kids on the outside looking to be part of something that they enjoy, and it's very enjoyable to watch them strive. Reviewed after watching all episodes as they first aired and then again on blu-ray.",Positive
"The songs are horrible. The premise is that we are cool if we figure out that it is a parody of HuffPo. The writing does not make me happy. I love Bebe Neuwirth as an actor, but I just must stop this waste of money. All of the actors seem funny and capable and they sing well. The talented writers need to find something they love and believe in so it will not ring so hollow. Great quality in execution; the script should have been negated as not being funny.",Negative

"Jason was the Only reason I spent time watching this pilot.  And I'm on the fence about whether to invest my time and entertainment dollar on the second episode.There is not a hint of Momoa being involved in sex so if he is only going to portray a psychotic half-breed with a chip on his shoulder, then I'm out.I saw Momoa killed once in Game of Thrones,  I have no interest in seeing him killed again in another series.What a waste of a powerfully sensual actor that would be.",Negative
"MEETING EVIL was pulled from its theatrical release after its opening weekend gross of $181(!!!).  While not a classic, I found it entertaining in a quirky sort of way.Luke Wilson plays a down on his luck realtor who finds himself in financial and marital woes.  Samuel L. Jackson shows up at his door and Wilson's troubles have just gotten worse.Wilson plays the sheepish role with his usual non-chalance, which works better in his comedic roles.  A more intense actor like James Franco might have strengthened the movie.  I'm not a big fan of Jackson, who always seems to play the same role in all his films.  His villainy in MEETING EVIL isn't totally convincing.  We needed a Michael C. Hall or Michael Douglas---a different kind of menace,  Leslie Bibb is pretty effective as Wilson's assertive spouse and Tracie Thoms (TV's COLD CASE) is surprisingly good as one of the skeptical cops.  Peyton List (TV's FLASH FORWARD) and Muse Watson (NCIS) are okay in under-developed roles.The ending is rather anti-climactic which is disappointing, but MEETING EVIL is a modest time-waster.",Positive
It took me a while to get used to Matt Smith. It felt like the series took a while to get used to him too. Smith really hits his stride in this season. Matt Smith is likable and silly and crazy once you get used to him and once the writers figure out who his Doctor is.,Positive

"I liked season two of this show.It's still a cute,sexy,funny romantic comedy.Yes,it's a bit raw,by American standards,but it's not an American show.The two lovebirds still have their problems  adjusting to marriage and their friends and family are still ridiculous.Stacey needs to grow up from a selfish girl to a grown woman.Maybe season three will see to that.",Positive
"""The news isn't about facts, it's about telling people what to think."" So says one of the main characters in Onion News Empire.While the plot is a bit awkward in this show, the barrage of hilarious news satire makes it absolutely worth watching.",Positive
"Still going strong, and a great counter to too many reality shows corrupting tv.  This show is just as good as Friends.",Positive
"This is by far the best program on PBS, I have been an avid viewer for over 35 years and no one comes close to the reporting done on PBS.  I enjoy watching it with my wife and kids.",Positive
"I'm from that area, and it's pretty close to spot on with MANY of the characters! The only thing that screws it up is when you see the outdoor locations which are NOTHING like KY. (i.e. the mountains of CA and the desert-ish locales)  Wish they'd film on location!",Positive
"This sounded like a great series...but the use of gore and blood in every scene was bordering on the pornographic. It seemed as though the close-up scenes of blood and guts were used to make up for a cliche,lack-luster plot. A waste of my Amazon Instant $$$.",Negative
Love it! I love everything about it. The leading lady is amazing! Simply amazing. Great comedy! Please continue this show.,Positive
"The idea of a chess master, crime solver is nice. Add into that he can not leave the hotel. The supporting characters are wonderful. The show just kept getting better and we were so disappointed to discover it had only one season. I really like Elementary, The Closer, Monk, Psych, Due South and this show seemed in that vein. Also no gratuitous violence or sexual imagery.",Positive
"I haven't watched the first season in its entirety, but I have watched enough episodes to have a grasp on the show and material. I was first heard about this through a lifetime teaser, which sucked because I didn't have the lifetime channel. When I found out it was on netflix, I got all excited and hoped it would live up to my expectations. Usually things fall far short from how they first appear, but this series has kept me interested and entertained the entire time.Details: The show starts out with a supermodel (Deb, I believe) who is extremely vain and couldn't picture herself as anything but a size 0, maybe 2, and is one of those ""beautiful people"". The word superficial definitely comes to mind. Due to an accident involving a truck and some grapefruit, which seems like a pretty bad way to die in my opinion, she makes her way up to a purgatory type locale. When trying to decide where her fate lies, she takes matters into her own hands and presses the ""return"" button on her guardian angel's keyboard. This sends her back to Earth but as Jane, a super intelligent lawyer with a heart of gold and a bit of extra weight. Basically, almost the exact opposite of Deb. The show helps Deb (in Jane's body) with several realizations that life is about more than just looks.Drama: To add an extra layer to everything, it turns out that Deb's fiance actually works for the same law firm as Jane. Oh how cruel fate can be... And while he is still grief stricken, he has shown some interest in one of their coworkers, much to Jane/Deb's dismay.Why 4 out of 5 stars then, you ask? It really ticked me off in the first few episodes when Jane was stressed and her assistant would feed her cheeze whiz straight out of a can or give her a doughnut to improve her mood. It almost seemed like the show was saying ""bigger women love to do these types of things, that's why they are bigger"". It was totally unnecessary and inconsiderate.",Positive
"Fantastic show. Great cast - wonderful to watch. Wonderfully compelling stories that keep you eager for the next episode. And the music...oh the music. We would watch this just for the music, but fortunately, this show is exceptional in every way. What a great (and long overdue) concept. Bring on season 2!",Positive
This show was better when I first began watching it.  I like it to see some of the strange exotic foodstuff that I had never even heard of and how they can be used in a dish.,Negative
i'm sure i will like it very much. i like all of the authors novels. now i have a face(that i like) to put to Harry' s carehcter,Positive
UP to now I think Farscape is my fav syfy of all time.  Since Rockne O'Bannon is involved I suppose that is why Defiance is right up there....at the top.  Just the right mix of  Sci  and Fi  ....,Positive
"I watched this a couple of weeks ago. There are plenty of movie stars in it, but I remember thinking it wasn't the best the Brit Tv I've seen. Entertaining, but the fact is I can't remember anything about it...and that's a bad sign.",Positive
"We are living in something of a golden age of TV. Besides this series, there's The Blacklist, Believe, House of Cards, Homeland, and a few others. Frankly, I've just watch the pilot episode and WOW! This is a Keri Russell I can guarantee you've never seen before. In the couple she's part of, sleeper spies for the Soviet Union in the Reagan era, she's the super-hardnosed partner. In the first few minutes, you see her in a garterbelt set, compromising a Federal official while providing oral sex. Between sex and brutal violence, this show is definitely not for the kiddiies.While I have only seen the pilot, my sister assures me that the quality holds up quite well.",Positive
"I may not personally like it, but my kids sure do! Definitely keeps them entertained and the silly songs stuck in their heads :)",Positive
"Great Show, especially if you love math, common sense and reasoning! Very Educational but also lots of action. Fast paced action! Characters are endearing. I have watched all 4 seasons!",Positive
"This is the best show on television, tied with NCIS. I love the characters and their humaness. There is plenty of action but these characters also have a soft side and I appreciate seeing that. I truly love this show.",Positive
This series always keeps me going. I really enjoy it and look forward to the upcoming season. Hope it comes soon.,Positive
"I actually really like this show and I remember thinking when it was being advertised that I should watch it, but never did. Now that it is no longer available, I am sad to know that I never helped with the ratings by watching it.",Positive
Amanda Tapping has created a futuristic (but realistic) show. I wish it had gone on longer (Boo to the networks for cancelling it!). Thank you for 4 wonderful seasons of creativity.,Positive
This show just keeps getting better for each season. I love it. You never know what to expect. Things change so quick it keeps you interested and waiting for the next episode. Very good acting by all characters. It has to be  the most action packed TV show ever.,Positive
"Very cirque du soleil, which is not my thing, but this lady can sing!  Seems to work amazing hard for her audience, makes for a great show.",Positive
Watched this when it was on standard prime time TV. Always wondered what happened to it and waited for it to come back. I guess it went to cable which I don't have. So glad the story continued to a second season. Haven't finished watching it yet so don't know if this is the end. What a great alien movie. I like all movies of this type. Most are stupid but this one has a great &#34;family&#34; story behind it. It's really more about that than the focus being on the aliens themselves. I still wish Hollywood would stop making aliens that look like bugs and robots though. Noah Wylie is great as are the kids and other cast members. Acting against a green screen can be difficult but they do a good job. Yay once again to Steven Spielberg.,Positive
"While our country is fighting a war against terrorist, I didn't find mocking the military to be amusing. It is possible to take war serious yet let the characters have some fun - remember MASH? Enlisted is just a bunch a guy who don't belong in the military and wouldn't be funny in any occupation. I expect this new show to soon be canceled.",Negative
I'm at episode 4 now and the show actually seems to get better..... John Goodman is awesome of course.Looks very promising to me and could be a huge multi-year success .......,Positive
"Thanks to the fortuitous and copious internal documentation of this particular cult we get a sneak peek into what it was like in the day. Seems like lots of hippies were lost and wandering after the 60's ended and looking for something to guide them and thus we ended up with these cult figures who filled the vacuum of meaning. It will happen again, one day.",Negative
"I had heard of this movie from a fellow horror movie buff and after fruitlessly searching for it locally, I got smart and ordered it through Amazon. This movie gave a nod to &#34;Thanatomorphose.&#34; Young girl with lesbian tendencies goes to a party, &#34;gets drunk&#34; and ends up in a tryst with a man... and that's just the beginning of her problems, as her body, social life and, ultimately, her mind falls apart.",Positive
"I have never become addicted to a TV show until now.  This show has superior acting from Thomas and Sarah, one surprise after another.  Too bad there are only 13 episodes.  I have watched them all.  Now what can take their place. Nothing can.",Positive
"Well done, to be sure but not something I enjoyed.  Just not to my liking.  I should have known better, just wanted to try it out.",Negative
We love that this show is still hilarious without pushing so many controversial topics. We always get a kick out of watching this show and relating to the characters.,Positive
This is a much scarier show than PLL with evilness and little girl's heads who turn completely backwards and lots of scary ghosts. Love it!!,Positive
"it says COMPLETE 2nd season, if that's true then how come when I go on to hulu plus they have new season 2 episodes that amazons so called &#34;complete&#34; season DOES NOT HAVE!!!! IT IS NOT COMPLETE IT DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE EPISODES OF THE SEASONAMAZON PLEASE STOP LYING SO MUCH!!!!!!",Negative
"I saw not the Overlook Hotel, but the haunted New York apartment building based on the real life Dakota in Rosemary's Baby, complete with the research into the building's evil and storied past. It is a genre trope that I like, so for that alone and the potential therein I was hooked.A young couple, living on the fringes of New York glamour in terms of the company that their professions bring them (lawyer and architect) but in the sticks in Queens in terms of their income, is first tempted with the offer of a beautiful apartment on the Upper East Side of New York for a nominal amount of managing work. Indeed, in the interview they are told that they need to keep their day jobs, so clearly there is another person or people in the building doing daily maintenance work. They grab the opportunity as anyone in their right mind would as it takes rich person money to live a middle class life in Manhattant. Nobody tells you that cheap, beautiful apartments in Manhattant require not only money but your immortal soul.It turns out that the building has more than just beautiful views and fixtures. It is stated more than implied that the owner is at the very least the devil's henchman. In addition to introducing the core characters, we are introduced to what may be the ""tenant of the week"" who falls afoul of the gifts given by the buildings owner. This week a tenant has his wife brought back to life but cannot keep murdering to keep her alive and ends by losing his own life as well.All in all, I thought that this was a moderately promising pilot. I will be watching again and hope that the core characters are made more interesting in episodes to come and that the nefarious history of the building and its owners is uncovered at a steady pace. The innocent young couple trope and the older, urbane, devilish temptors has been done before not only in Rosemary's Baby but in the Devil's Advocate; this doesn't have to be a weakness but these weren't the strongest out of the box characterizations that I have ever seen and I hope they deepen and become more human and less carboard tropes as the season progresses. Recommended to fans of the new serials and mysteries. So far is unsettling rather than the real terror of horror, which works for me but may not for others. Definitely worth checking out to see how 666 Park Avenue develops.",Positive
This show did a 180 from season 1. Lots more scandal and drama it went from a intresting show to edge of your seat in season 2. I honestly cant wait to see more.,Positive
"My 14 yr old granddaughter loved this when she was younger and was very excited to watch the very first episode ever. Now my 8 year old is getting into it. It's a good story for kids, where the good guys are actually respectful to grown ups. Love it.",Positive
"Watched the pilot episode. The Last Ship kicked off to a promising start and was engaging. The question, however, is whether it dissolves into a predictable human drama devoid of scientific and military realism. No, the crew would not mutiny; no, you cannot develop a vaccine in 48 hours.The most recent failure that jumps to mind is &#34;Last Resort&#34; (the story of a ballistic submarine given highly suspect orders to fire their nukes). The initial kick-off was tense and exciting but it rapidly deteriorated into a farce in which the captain rarely took decisive and appropriate action, and in which the crew was continuously flirting with mutiny. It just wasn't believable at any level.So I keep my fingers crossed this drama does not share the same fate. A good story that does not meander aimlessly is the key here!",Positive
This series is the best I've seen in a long time and would highly recommend it to my family and friends.  Great acting a good story.,Positive
"I LOVE this show!  I appreciate all the aspects of living in a small town that is so realistically displayed in this show.  From the politics to personal interactions to the good people of a town, as well as the bad characters.  A little bit of sci-fy is thrown in too.  I was sorry to see the writers kill off the Sheriff as I like that actor.  But I'm liking the woman replacement, who is of hispanic origins plus it's a woman.  If you have not watched this show it's about te sudden appearance of a clear dome that drops over the small town of Cedars Mills.  The military attempts everything to destroy it without success.  The general concensus is it's a other worldly happening.  Time will reveal what caused it.  If anyone comes near the dome with electronics it causes them to explode.  Which explains what killed the Sheriff.  He had a pacemaker that explodes out of his chest when getting too close to the dome.  Watches, hearing aids and cell phones explode as well.  I LOVE Stephen King and have really looked forward to this series.  My hope is the writing continues to be well done.  Highly Recommended!",Positive
"I like the way they started with the lead character, interesting and good enough suspense.  Some of the characters are a little heavy handed, but the other characters make up for it.  The ending was a good enough cliff hanger that I definitely want to see what happens next!",Positive
"This is one of my favorite genres -- Cooking and Science! Absolutely great show!I love the Amazon Streaming Video availability -- easy, convenient, and free with prime.",Positive

Warehouse 13 Season 4 was just as pleasurable as the previous seasons of this hit television show.  The show is entertaining and a pleasure to watch.  If a fan of the show I don't think you will be put off.  Definitely a watch worthy show.,Positive
I can't believe that they cancelled this show. Very entertaining and a different police show than the standard CSI or Law and Order.,Positive
The show pulls me into the story.  Especially the story of the villain.  Why does he do the things he does.  What is it he is after.  And will the FBI figure it out hehe.,Positive
I really like this on tv. I watched most of the first season then. I have caught one or two in other seasons. This does not stand up if you try to watch more than one at a time.,Positive
"It's hard to watch how childish people are.  How we humans get through a disaster, baffles me.  99% of the sheeple just complain and steal and complain, no one rising to the occasion, everyone yelling my brother my father my sister my children, parochial.So I don't wonder this series only lasted two seasons.  The mirror, hurts.Most poignant in the first episode is the narrow-minded mother who accuses the mayor of not knowing what it's like to have your kid 'out there', when in fact Jake is 'out there', and his dad the mayor, doesn't know if he's still alive.  But he has no luxury to think about that, to cry, to worry.But oh, that mother thinks she's supposed to yell at the mayor, to be a good mother.  Instead, she's not only a bad mother, but a bad human being, heedless of anyone but her own ego.  She obviously doesn't even care about her kids;  because if she did, she'd be trying to help, not yelling.Hope someone will redo the series, for we need to see how hypocritical, parochial and ill-prepared we are, to assemble and think through a crisis, always expecting someone else to handle it;  always uninterested in the big picture, uninterested in doing something ourselves, always ready to blame someone else, never paying attention.It was always 'cool' to pay little attention in school.  Only the bad guys run things.  To be disinterested in anything but one's narrow circle, is supposed to be a virtue.  Yeah, and this is what we get for such bad attitudes.So this series really focuses on WHY war occurs.  Dark lesson never learned.  Which you know, because the music is totally at odds with the theme of the series.  Hence only four stars.",Positive
Everyone was at their best - or worst depending on how you look at them.  It just wish it hadn't been the setting stage for the end of the series.  True entertainment is rare these days and a story you can lose yourself in for a while is even more rare.  The Warehouse really is a living entity of endless wonder - and I will miss my favorite characters so much.  My streaming and DVDs are going to get a MAJOR workout frequently in the future.,Positive
This show lost some of its mojo in seasons 4 and 5 but its back on track. Not too thrilled with some of the story arcs but I am looking forward to its final season.,Positive
"The show has it's high and low points, I guess it's tough to write for a hero who's a crook.  Kenny Johnson always holds up his end as the spoiler in the crew, the man with a conscience and the only one on the crew with real physical presence.  Walton Goggins does his thing well as does the rest of the cast.Jay Karnes really rocks in one episode, all in all, it's a season worth watching.",Positive
"Fun to watch and romantic movie series about the book Pride and Prejudice, and I am glad they did this series, it was nice to see it.",Positive
Zombie shows just don't get any better than The Walking Dead! Season 4 is packed with so many surprises at every turn. This is an intense season of WD.,Positive
"Good for mindless TV watching. Overly stereotypical writing overall.  I may keep up with it, but I hope the writing improves.",Negative
"As a fan of high school comedies (Election being almost perfect) this pilot disappoints.  Nothing seemed real about it.  Juvenile teachers or actors imitating juvenile teachers, it was just dull.  Made me wince.  The principal has possibilities, but only if the teachers are much more on top of things than he is.At least two of the three teachers seemed like warmed over Joel McHale imitations.  Nuh, uh.",Negative
"It don't know kids these days that well, nor the educational environment. But I know that media is cynical and too rough for young minds too often. I have read the bullying is an issue with grade school, maybe into junior high. And that young people per se aremore creative, open-minded thanks to being inundated with exciting media views of what's Out There and Ahead.The sharp, quick writing and editing and quasi-adult production qualities and topics are right-on. I think kids are ready for it and willbenefit from it. Certainly, they'll get into it; there's no 'talking down' to this generation as was the case in mine. Kid get more complextoday (media exposure again), and the writing and concept levels here play to that level. Nickelodeon and Sesame Street are goodfirst steps; this hits about those and carrying young viewers ahead with issues and answers. Hip, quick, right to them. Great show. rc",Positive
"This is a major soap opera with bullets.  About the only problem I have is keeping up with who our hero is &#34;keeping time&#34; with.  But it really doesn't matter all that much, it is a little hard telling them apart.",Positive
"The guy with the chip in his head has really bad hair. Really. Bad. Plots can be predictable; his Asian female nemesis annoys me for some reason. The story lines often fail to worry me at all, so it's just an exercise in which predictable course will the action take. I have hopes.",Negative
What an amazing show. Raylan is the best bad Marshall you can't help but to love.  Boyd and Raylan chemistry is amazing,Positive
"Originally, I had no particular inclination to review the BBC production of ""South Riding."" But after seeing this program, people are tending to fall into either love it or hate it positions.  This perfectly pleasant presentation is far from perfect and yet it has plenty to recommend it as well. So, with no other reviews, I felt compelled to chime in with the middle ground and present a few pros and cons of the miniseries. To rate this at the five star level indicating that it is at the top echelon of quality might seem to set unreasonable expectations. While nice, this is hardly on the level of the original ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" or the sublime recent version of ""Bleak House."" Everything can't be five stars or the classification loses any meaning! Conversely, even if you don't particularly care for the program--there are many solid elements (especially the performances) that would elevate it beyond a dismissive one star. So here I am, standing squarely in the middle--at about 3 1/2 stars rounded up for three very convincing actors (a strong Anna Maxwell-Martin, the always reliable David Morrissey, and the increasingly entertaining Penelope Wilton).If this three part miniseries is guilty of anything, it is of having too much story to compress into its limited timeframe. Ostensibly the tale covers an entire town's worth of characters and story lines and three episodes is not adequate time to present them in an in-depth way. The heart of the story involves a local girl (Maxwell-Martin) returning to South Riding to take up a position as the school mistress. Headstrong and independent, she immediately clashes with some of more traditional town leaders--including Morrissey. You know immediately where this battle of wills is headed, but credit the writer and actors for maintaining a credible conflict without an easy resolution. This is, by far, the most intriguing aspect of the story as Morrissey is haunted by an unresolved relationship in his life. Maxwell-Martin may be a little progressive and modern for this tiny 1930's village, but she plays with a wide eyed conviction that keeps you on her side.The story, however, also extends to subplots about an illicit affair, a land grab scheme, an impoverished girl making good, unrequited attraction and a number of other narrative elements battling for screen time. The talented supporting cast is very much underserved by the script that has little time or interest to develop them beyond the most superficial qualities. As such, much of the drama and impact of ""South Riding"" is limited. The second episode is probably the most engaging with the Maxwell-Martin and Morrissey pairing being explored at length. But even that plot point comes to an abrupt end. The complicated and overstuffed plot points, however, all come to tidy conclusions in a rushed ending filled with pat solutions and cliched narration.For its faults, though, this is still a handsome production filled with terrific actors. I'm glad I watched it, and I found it entertaining and pleasurable. Is it the best that BBC or Masterpiece Theater has to offer? Not even close! But if you enjoy this type of entertainment, this show has its share of charm even if it's not particularly substantive. A good effort that simply has too much going on and, thus, leaves the viewer wanting more story and character development. KGHarris, 5/11.",Positive
"I wasn't sure whether I would like this show.  I loved the original version of Beauty and the Beast but was willing to give this version a try.  I liked the first episode well enough to give it another couple of episodes before I decided one way or the other if I truly liked it.  So, long story short-this is the 17th episode and I am still watching it, love the characters and am giving it 5 stars.  I hope it gets picked up for a second season and I will be buying every episode of the second season plus the dvd for this season regardless of whether cwtv continues it or not.  I am hoping they continue it.",Positive
"Longmire is one of those people you love to watch, he is tough as nails and when it comes to family he will break any rules to ensure safety as best he can.  I assume we are going to find out more about the guy that killed his wife this season and that bit sounds interesting.  The political side of this keeps you a bit on edge since you can never be sure where the deputy actually stands in this battle of wills and the random appearances of Gerald McRaney as the father of Branch Connelly.  Then you add in Lou Diamond Phillips and you have the cast to make this a great hit.  I know that Katee Sackhoff gets top billing in many articles but even though I enjoy her character here I was never much of a fan of her characters in Battlestar Galactica.Bottom Line:  This is a great show, great cast and should not be missed, it is my summertime fix when I want to watch Justified but can't :)",Positive
"Still not 100% sure how I feel about BUTTER.  Not butter butter, but the film starring Jennifer Garner, Ty Burrell and Hugh Jackman!  I liked it, just not sure how much - it's a quirky indie film with a freaking BRILLIANT performance by Jennifer Garner (who I have new respect for, after watching this), who plays Laura, an ambitious (and fairly nutso) woman in Iowa whose laid-back and henpecked husband Bob (Ty Burrell) has won the local and state butter-carving (yes, I said butter-carving) competitions the last 15 years in a row.  Laura's sees this unbreakable record as her and Bob's way into the governor's mansion, but when officials suggest that Bob retire and give someone else a chance, Laura's hopes threaten to go up in flames - until she decides she must go into competition herself, to save what investment she's made in her and Bob's future.Unfortunately for Laura, this time around she faces some truly stiff competition in the form of a young African-American girl named Destiny, an orphan who's been shuffled from one set of foster parents to another all her life.  Destiny, quiet and introspective and incredibly creative, is a true artist with butter - which brings out the sociopath in Laura, who will do pretty much ANYTHING to make sure the butter sculpting title stays in the family, even when an angry prostitute that Bob has yet to pay enters the competition just to drive Laura nuts, too.The film is bizarre, if you haven't already figured that out, but also (at times) very funny, and holds together I think because of Jennifer Garner's terrific work as Laura.  Hugh Jackman, as a car salesman Laura used to boff in high school, has a role that's pivotal but too small to really ho him justice, and Yara Shahidi as Destiny is definitely a treat, holding her own with Garner when she's at her nuttiness.Not everyone will like 'Butter' but I did.  It's odd, quirky, farce-like, and the hooker's storyline goes on a bit too long (although Olivia Wilde, as Brooke, does great with the role, every time she's on screen).  If you like odd little indie comedies that seem to take the ""left of center"" road, you should like this one as I did.",Positive
This is a great show for children in pre-k or even younger. It really helps introduce counting and small arithmetic operations such as adding and subtracting small numbers. The characters are very kid friendly and their adventures involve real people as well as other animated characters. You cannot go wrong with this show!,Positive
"I like the British actors better...like many series...it may be slipping into zombie overload...oh, wait...they haven't brought that in yet have they? Maybe I missed that episode.",Negative
I like the play between characters in this show.  Lots of interesting story lines etc.  A great show to watch!,Positive
"There aren't many shows I watch just for light-hearted fun and enjoyment, and this is one.  It's a calming, relaxing, wind-down tv series that I look forward to every night.  The characters and the stories are interesting and pull you right in for an hour of simple enjoyment.  I recommend it.",Positive
became quickly bored with the episode and did not even finish watching.  disposable characters which did not generate any feeling of attachment,Negative
"i rented this film and it reached all of the promises made. Ronan is perfect in the role, her supporting cast keep up with her and the combination of personally overcoming obstacles matches the movie's bigger questions involving an end of the world scenario.",Positive
"Riley Keough and Juno Temple star in Jack & Diane which is basically a love story between two young women and disguised as a warewolf story as well. But the whole warewolf storyline was pretty much vacant and nothing, and I mean NOTHING happens in this movie. The writer/director couldn't create a full and compelling story, the writing is flat, the acting is only really good from Juno Temple, and the direction is sloppy. And the way Riley Keough looks in this movie is like a young Elvis Presley which is I'm sure intentional since that is her grandfather for crying out loud! I just didn't believe the relationship between Jack & Diane, they fall in love way too quickly and I can't figure out why they do? This movie is pointless and I'm only giving it 2 stars (way too generous, I know) because of Temple's performance.",Negative
Really good series set in the late 50's....The British know how to do great TV and this is another of the fine shows.,Positive
"The problem is that the premise, a group can successfully keep a whole family hostage for this long, is just not real.  I see so many opportunities for the family to reach out and get help.  The doc could have spoken to the secret service senior agent.  Once she knew Duncan's identity---she had all the power she needed.  Her cell can record so she could have recorded her husband's shooting and gone from there.Then there is the moment she decides to leave her kids in the wind, knowing they are being pursued to go back to her husband.  Wow, I am supposed to appreciate this woman? Choosing her faithless husband, while I get it she still loves him, over her kids.  ALL She had to do at this point was call the cops to her house and get on the bus.  End of the line for the whole conspiracy.This moment has come and gone so many times.  The world is too large for this kind of hostage taking to survive this long.  It doesn't matter how many people they have in place---she had all the power the moment she escaped.  Go to an attorney and that would be all the concealment she'd need.  She knew the husband had stayed behind, calling him just put him in danger and gave them leverage.  She just is not believably that stupid.I wanted to like it but just can't get past the constant feeling that the characters are not real people.  They are just too dumb.  The young man is smart enough to deal under his family and school's nose and he uses a pay phone.  Every kid in this country knows how caller ID works.  My kid knows how to block the outgoing number, so I am sure he would have.The boyfriend.... the girl could confide in him with her parents advice and he could go to an attorney and they could contact an outside police force with all kinds of photos, recordings etc....  The family has easy access to various cells so they could quite easily record evidence of their incarceration to pass on to the boyfriend Boyd.It just requires too much suspension of disbelief to watch any more.The actors and the quality are the only positives.  The story is the source of the failure.",Negative

"Following the success, warm reviews and award accolades galore for her debut feature Away From Her, actress Sarah Polley has return with her second feature as writer and director. While not a masterpiece like her earlier triumph, Take This Waltz still manages to have enough interest and ambition to make it a worthy, if not a remarkable follow up. The outer crust is rich, but I suspect the inside to be hollow. Which comes as something of a shame, but I think Polley will continue to grow as a filmmaker and should defiantly remain on everyone's radar.Set in Polley's native Toronto, and following Margot (Michelle Williams) and Lou (Seth Rogen), a young married couple old before their time. She, a bored wife writing tedious travel brochures, he a would-be chief working on a thriller of a book regarding the many ways to prepare a chicken dinner. Margot has a chance meeting with a handsome stranger (Luke Kirby) while on assignment, a meet cute that follows her onto the airplane trip back home ,and grows all the more awkward when they realize that they are close neighbors. He is Daniel and he leads a more carefree existence that easily attracts the attention, but more slowly is the affections of Margot. Not wanting a full blown love affair to bloom, Margot still finds herself being drawn to the more adventures and relaxed Daniel. Meanwhile Lou remains tamely unaware, with a further conflict developing involving his alcoholic sister, Geraldine (Sarah Silverman).Polley is a fine actress who hasn't always landed the plum juicy roles that she deserves, in fact it surprises me more than a little that she hasn't cast herself in any of the strong roles in one of her own films, yet. She is also a first rate director, one who understands how to direct actors, that was keenly evident in her debut feature, there is still a difference of opinion over weather Julie Christie was robbed of an Oscar win or not, but is even more so here.  This movie succeeds in spit of it's pretensions and often lumbering plotting thanks to the excellent performances.Michelle Williams is adorable as always, smart and assured playing the sort of character she's becoming a specialist in, I suspect that a lot of people will recall Blue Valentine when watching this film. The real kudos, though, must go to Seth Rogen, who is nicely cast against type, in a role that will seem familiar to many people. His Lou has done nothing wrong, he's just an observer in his own life story. The tenderness and sadness that Rogen brings to the role helps to show something I have seen before in the actor, but has largley been left neglected and that is that he's actually a pretty good actor. Also well cast is comedian Sarah Silverman who has finally found a film role worthy of her talent.The movie is also highlighted by a nifty soundtrack featuring a lott of indie rock and alternative music. Which should come as little surprise as the film was inspired by the moody song of the same name by legendary Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, it is not as richly texture or as poetic as the song. The movie is also unfortunately lacking in the wit that can often be found in so much of Cohen's beautiful and deeply felt music. A cool place to find inspiration for a film though, see what I mean about the keen insight that Polley brings to her films.The frustrations and boredom in Margot's life is the centerpiece of the movie, told in such a low key way, to the point of banality, which probably is the point. It leaves the events of the picture to unfold a little on the stodgy side. At almost two hours it is a little long as well, a censored version released  in Canada runs 91 minutes, one must wonder if that versions play better.Take This Waltz resembles nothing more than a big budgeted mumble core movie, you know those films that are famously underwritten and developed with amateur performances and dialogue thought up on the fly, but with everyone having sex and getting naked at the drop of a hat. The sex is toned down, and Polley's script is better than that,  but the characterizations are certainty more facile. There's often not enough to sustain a real interest here, but the emotional content is strong particularly towards the ending confrontations, most of which unfold to the contraire of expectations.An uneven film for sure dealing with issues familiar to the indie drama crowd, Take This Waltz fails to avoid clich&eacute;. I have already mentioned Williams' Oscar nominated triumph in the superb Blue Valentine, which I'm sure that this will conjure up memories of that admittedly superior film. Polley's film lacks the deep perspective of that film which helped to make it so afflicting and memorable. However, the cast rises above the material, and Polley has left her script rich enough for them to find something to say even when they have nothing left to speak of. This is the ultimate success of this small, but thoughtful enough film.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",Negative
"Excellent cast.A good story that kept me waiting for the next chapter.  Perfectly played, both culturally & generational.I look more from this writer.",Positive
"Well done! I enjoyed Season 2 of Without Motive quite a bit. It was engaging, well paced, and I was very interested to see this season out. Seeing Season 1 is a must, however, and I didn't enjoy that season very much at all.",Positive
Love it!  As usual it's good entertainment!!,Positive
"Great and important premise. Well done scripting. Well acted. Special effects are good enough, and they actually help the show without BEING the show.  Interesting character development. Better every season. Has the makings of a classic!",Positive
"this is my favorite. Since we do not have cable television, I now watch it many times over and over.",Positive
"Timothy Olyphant keeps bringing you back to see what his character, Deputy U.S. Marshall Rayland Givens, will  do next to bring in those elusive fugitives in Harland County, Kentucky. Along the way he attracts some very beautiful women which keeps the show interesting. I cannot wait to see what he does next.",Positive
I think this is an interesting spin on the whole story history from Disney. It s pretty well written and if you will notice you tend to like some of the characters that are technically the antagonist of the plot.,Positive
"The season isn't as formulaic as one would suppose.Basic Concept, the main guy is a ""Grimm"", which means that he and his ancestors somehow gained the ability to ""see"" people who aren't quite people, but only when they get upset (they take on animalish aspects when upset, elsewise they look fairly normal).Each episode seemingly brings you another animal type, according to the background the whole thing is based on the stories by the brother's Brimm (Hence the name), and season one had it's take on Little Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks, etc.NOTHING like the original material in so far as plot,  think more using the story concept as a jumping off point, twisting it for our times and putting it in Portland or the immediate area.Tends towards a bloody resolution, some obligatory dead bodies, that sort of thing.Entertaining, but would get boring if not for the back story of the other characters.Wife gets mystically whacked by a witch and loses her memory (Season is spent pretty much getting that back and realizing she still loves Grimm.  A bit drawn out, but the ideas and way it was handled was a nice diversion from what you'd expect).The Grimm's at one point worked for a royal family in Europe, but no more, and of course they have a secret key that when stacked with another 6 keys leads to a super secret something.  A bit contrived, particularly the structure of the keys, but a ....  wait for it...  KEY plot device in moving the background story forward.There's also some comedy and romance in the thing as well.I subscribed to the series, don't regret it, but then again, seldom find myself wanting to go back and review a lot of the episodes.",Negative
"It 's an interesting show because they explain why and how things work. Their product reviews are good, too, always informative.",Positive
"What more could you ask for from 3 sluts and a &#34;use-ta-could&#34;? Seriously, these ladies (and I do mean ladies) play their roles flawlessly. My girlfriend and I watch them when it is bedtime and we would otherwise be falling asleep. Opening credits roll and next thing we know closing credits are rolling! There has to be something said for subliminal entertainment because we always wake up with a smile! Oh wait, TV had nothing to do with that!",Positive
This is an excellent show for little ones of all ages. The characters are all adorable and cute. All three of my grandsons love it.,Positive
Good family British programming sorry the seris ended truly enjoyed it... Keep the seris coming.. Good plot and stories a Must watch,Positive
NCIS is one of the greatest shows that's ever been on television. If you like cop drama this is the ultimate. I don't think any more needs to be said.,Positive
"Very interesting story line for an Irish series.  No IRA terrorists around it appears, and yet the closeness of the small rural Irish community breeds its own contempt for the rule of law.  Excellent acting from the protagonist, and very interesting characters all around, and oh, the scenery, I could watch it just for that.",Positive
"The film is overwhelming with overkill.  It has everything.  Great stunts, great cinematography, epic (and acrobatic!) battle scenes, more blood than Quentin Tarantino could stomach, some sex, tea ceremonies, Chinese poetry, The Art of War, great acting, great overacting.  Director Woo was out to Wow and he succeeded.  Don't skip the credits.  The cast and crew of this film make the old DeMille &#34;cast of thousands&#34; look sadly understaffed.  If we started making films like this in the USA we could reduce the unemployment rate below 4 percent in no time at all.",Positive
"Well done.  Suspense, thrilling, will even bring you back on some history!  Love the show, glad to see it's coming back for a 2nd season!",Positive
"Welcome to the ADD format.  The ""episodes"" are about three minutes long; two per download.  Just when the story is getting interesting the episode is over.  Not to mention if you want to get really sick of a theme song listen to it forty-eight times more or less in a row.  An interesting story butchered by the desire to squeeze every last penny out of it in this format.",Negative
"While watching Louisiana rednecks isn't my thing, I have to admit that the Robertson clan have decent family values that they've instilled in their family and grand kids. The recordings are great to watch, since you don't have to put up with commercials and the first three seasons provided a neat gift for my daughter and her family.",Positive
"I couldn't sit past 34 mins at which time that writers haven't even given a clue as to why the city is in crisis (which started at the beginning of the show).  And if you get mad at those typical TV things that would never happen in real life, then skip this one.",Negative
"Well, the cover of the DVD with such words as Scandal, Child Star, Love Affair, Paparazzi etc, etc.. You'd think the movie would be entertaining, interesting, with a sense of taboo that just makes you want to watch it en grossly just much like the real love Story between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was. But No, as a viewer I don't get that. I don't get the sense of passionate, scandalous and bizarre love affair. The Only thing I got from watching this Movie is a boring, bland and amateur re-telling of a supposedly legendary love story of two film stars.What else can I say? Lifeless acting from most of the cast. Especially, Lindsay Lohan. Who ever thought she would do a good job at playing Elizabeth Taylor must've had a whimsical sense of humor indeed. Not denying that she's a bad actress watch her act in Mean Girls, The Parent Trap I've gotta give her some credit for acting in these two movies but in this one. Uh-Uh she just did it all wrong! I didn't buy her as Elizabeth Taylor, I didn't buy the fact that she was madly in love to the point of damaging her career. She Just seemed off on screen. Not to mention the slim to none resemblance between her and the real Elizabeth, you'd think she'll put more effort into acting her role to compensate for that fact but no. I was pretty disappointed, the only thing she seemed to do was memorize lines and repeat them on screen with just a tad bit of emotions coming across. Even in her purposed outbursts she just seemed like a walking corpse that the writers weren't even interested in to begin with so they gave her horrendous lines and a very one dimensional character to portray.The Other actors aren't that great either but since they're not the main once they can get away with their zombie walks and poor acting skills. The One Playing Burton was acceptable but that's only because he was surrounded with such lame actors so he stood out as you can say. He tried his best for his defense too bad there was little he could do since the writing itself wasn't that helpful.The Movie itself was tasteless. Most of the time the viewers are told that this and that is happening. For Example, that Richard is cheating on his wife with another married woman which is Elizabeth and are deemed sinful in the eyes of the public but it just seems to come so easy for them afterwards. It's like no one really cares whether they were having an affair or not in such times when things like these were rare. The whole sense of impending danger, the whole sense of scandal is lost in this film.Watching it is like reading an article on the internet about Elizabeth and Richards relationship. That's all I can say. You might as well just read a 5 minute article instead of wasting your time watching this movie cause that's all you're gonna get in the end. The audience don't get to connect with the characters, we don't even get to meet them. We just see Lindsay Lohan presumably yelling, screaming, throwing fits of anger, crying, laughing, smoking, complaining, talking, swimming, kissing and whatever else she's doing on the film. And then the actors are just there. I could care less whatever happens to the characters at the end I don't even want to know. Even if the director decided to twist the story a little bit and have Elizabeth and Richard Commit suicide like Romeo and Juliet instead of divorcing I still wouldn't care.I Guess, I should give credit for the writers and producers for taking such a passionate love affair and making it such a boring, tedious and whiny one.And Lindsay Lohan please next time don't accept a role if you're not gonna act it properly. I'm sure the director didn't intend for you to be a wallflower with nice clothes and make up. You Actually have to act out your role you know.I don't know, if you wanna waste your time then watch this movie other than that skip it completely. I Know I'm sounding a tad too harsh but it's my honest opinion.",Negative
"This is the first season of survivor my GF and I have ever watched, so we actually wanted to give the show five enthusiastic stars because survivor rocks. Now that we have seen some of the other classic, more widely beloved seasons we think that three stars is a better review of Nicaragua. I don't want to give away spoilers but some of the contestants don't seem like they really want to be there, the strategy is pretty pathetic for survivor standards, and the weather is rainy for pretty much the whole season which doesn't bother me on my couch too much but it was pretty draining for the contestants.",Negative
A refreshing unique show that shows how life is for high schoolers in a little town in Ohio who are in a Glee Club. The characters-both students and teachers will make you see life differently and make you laugh and be sympathetic to a character within moments of each other.,Positive
This short series is good and I would recommend it to a friend.  It gets a bit mundane in that he sleeps with every woman that comes into the series.,Negative
"Amazing production value on this program.  I am very impressed with the lineup of shows that Amazon has produced.  This is my second one, and I'm loving it, too.  I've been a fan of the character for a long time.  This was such a pleasure to watch.  Superb cast, great acting, wonderfully filmed.",Positive
This series continues to turn our childhood fairy tales on their ear.  It's a continual surprise to see what the writers have in store for the audience.  The plots are as twisted as a ball of tangled yarn resulting in surprise after surprise.,Positive
"I can't say I am a fan of Bubble Guppies, but my kids are. It seems that the educational aspects are a bit weak in this series. It seems they spent more time working on the musical bits than the educational bits. The songs are catchy and will get caught in your brain, but I'm not sure I like that. I'd rather have educational shows than edutainment...",Negative
"Of all the show that I've watches lately, I must say that this is the best show today. I'm glad that I've own my own copy, so that I can always watch it over and over again.",Positive
"I remember when this show firsts started airing. 3 guys with their camera's went out alone to try to find evidence of paranormal activity. Usually the first 30 minutes of the show would be them getting a back history on the place and the new 20-25 minutes of them doing the actual investigation, and then the last 5-10 minutes of them reviewing what they caught and following up with people. I watched the show off and on over the years but the later season seems pretty different. It's not just them alone going into places anymore they have people that review the footage, and the dialogue the crew says sometimes just seems so scripted. Actually in this episode Zak seems like he's acting. Way different than the enthusiasm the group kind of showed in earlier episodes when going into places and the unscripted dialogue and them genuinely being surprised. Maybe by now they've been enough places and experienced enough activity that things don't interest them the same as they did before. Zak actually seems kind of strange now and the rest of the group seems pretty worn down. Makes you wonder where Television Entertainment and Reality Split. Has the experiences they've had over the years effected them personally and changed them or is it just an act for the show. Who knows... either way I like the Ghost Adventurers the show was always cool to me but like everything that gets popular it changes and stops being interesting after a while. The 100th episode was mostly them sitting in the exorcist room using the same gadgets from every other episode and getting the same results. A few evp's something strange happens to the equipment, I've got goosebumps, yadda yadda. I really miss the old show where they had the ""LOCK DOWNS"" and stayed in a place allnight. Do they still do that? because they didn't do that in this episode?",Negative
"we cant get enough of Raylan and Boyd's adventures.  The cast is first rate and the dialog is so good.  Just cant wait for the next episode to see what manner of evilness Raylan has to outwit.  Some of his solutions are are so clever it makes you laugh.  Boyd is so devious, we loved Walter Goggins on The Shield but he is truly in his element in this show.  All the supporting players  are awesome.",Positive
I was stunned when the episode ended. I totally forgot that I was  watching a pilot and went to play the next episode.Looking forward to the series and definitely hope it won't take long.I would have paid to watch this in a theater but it's even better because I'm in the comfort of my home.,Positive
"&#8220;V/H/S 2&#8221; is that rare horror sequel that actually manages to outdo its predecessor. It begins with the frame narrative, &#8220;Tape 49,&#8221; in which private investigatory Larry and his girlfriend/partner Ayesha take a job to find a missing college student. They discover his seemingly abandoned home filled with a still-recording laptop and a stack of video tapes. Since the subject is missing and he&#8217;s recorded on the laptop talking about the strange nature of the VHS tapes, Ayesha is tasked with watching the videos for clues as to his whereabouts while Larry searches the house. Smart move, Larry.&#8220;Phase I Clinical Trials&#8221; uses cybernetic technology to record everything our protagonist sees. Unfortunately, the restored vision also means he can see ghosts, which begin to haunt him. He encounters a woman named Clarissa, who had a similar cybernetic upgrade for her hearing. They work together to try to survive a nightmare world they didn&#8217;t know existed until it gets the better of them.&#8220;A Ride in the Park&#8221; is a zombie film with heart. Our protagonist decides to strap a camera to his helmet as he bikes an extreme trail, only to encounter zombies. It&#8217;s a POV series of alternately hilarious and heartbreaking shots about what it means to be the living dead.&#8220;Safe Haven,&#8221; the centerpiece of the anthology, is completely off the rails nuts in which every trope shows up: a cult, demonic possession, demonic births, mass suicides, and zombies (in that order) show up at one point. It all hangs together nicely, although the ending is unfortunately undercut by bad puppet effects.&#8220;Slumber Party Alien Abduction&#8221; is pretty much what it says on the tin. It involves a slumber party and an alien abduction. The aliens use a combination of terrifying lights and sounds, which has a disorienting effect in a POV film as you never quite know what you&#8217;re witnessing. It also features a dog cam, a first.The overarching plot works better than the first &#8220;V/H/S&#8221; by focusing on the films themselves. It seems our missing college student believed that by watching supernaturally recorded snuff films in a certain order, he could be affected &#8211; it&#8217;s clear he&#8217;s part of some weird Internet group dedicated to this sort of thing &#8211; and our protagonists (who aren&#8217;t quite as awful as the crew from the first) unwittingly stumble into the ongoing experience. There&#8217;s lots of stupidity here too though &#8211; Larry at one point just leaves Ayesha in a house they broke into to &#8220;get medicine,&#8221; among other absurdities, but they&#8217;re easily overlooked by the superb short stories.",Positive
Interesting pilot with a different approach on the &#34;Zombie Problem&#34;.  Will have to start watching the series to see where it goes to determine if I'll follow the series. LOOKS PROMISING RIGHT NOW!!,Positive
"I forced myself to watch the entire episode. It made little sense and irritated me.Recycled actors. I've never been so uninterested in a Sharon Lawrence role, and I really like her.Not many special effects, considering it's a Syfy show. The closing credits had the most visual appeal.Too linear. Might have been more interesting had they used flashbacks. Also, the sets were bland and generic. You need more than some litter and smoke to portray a realistic apocalyptic mood.Still, I gave it 2 stars because I really have seen worse, I think.",Negative
"Note: I saw all the episodes in HD via XFinity On Demand.The newest television show from FOX about a serial killer and the ex-FBI Agent tortured by his past with him as he races to stop him grabs you from the first episode, and doesn't let you go until the final frame of the shocking season finale. Kevin Bacon is sharp-as-a-tack and tormented by his own demons, and James Purefoy is Hannibal Lecter with a twist.Every episode is worth it.",Positive
I have Enjoyed all of her series very much good cast of characters and good show themes. writing is great,Positive
"The many characters Eliza Dushku plays in this series make it quite a different type of series.  She gets into different types of scenarios where all skills are put to the test to solve the particular, mystery for that episode.",Positive
"Acting is good, well developed characters and good plot. This actually was the second time I saw it and enjoyed it the second time as much as the first.",Positive
I love to watch Oswald especially when I'm trying to calm a rowdy bunch. Call able lessons are learned in a peaceful way and I love how the Grands look both ways and say bleep at each head turn like they do on the show.,Positive
"This is just a generic, cookie cutter adventure series with the Marvel name slapped on it. The sole connection to the Marvel universe is the character of Coulson, who otherwise brings nothing to the show. There are occasional gratuitous references to the Avengers and the invasion of New York.The rest of the characters are stereotypes and none of the actors are convincing in these roles. Not only are they too young to possess the skills they pretend to have, their acting is wooden and the chemistry among the cast non-existent.",Negative
"I just cannot say enough about this series ! It is fantastic ! Great acting , great love story , great ww1 storyline ! Should have a better description ! Highly recommend don,t miss this one !",Positive
"So far a thumbs up for this serieal killer twist. Kind of an original idea to me. Plus, Bacon's always good.",Positive
"The series is a set of great murder mysteries solved by a Detective who comes from a working class neighborhood where he learned his trade.  He is obviously out of his comfort zone living and working in the world of the privileged and intelligentsia.  His partner has significantly greater education and the two rub raw sometimes but they also compliment each other and together do a great job of solving the impossible cases, at the same time entertaining us very well.",Positive
"Yeah, this series is filled with T&A and excellent writing.  The multitude of plot surprises is worth every cent you pay.  You will not be bored with CALIFORNICATION.",Positive

"My 2 year old son has been watching Yo Gabba Gabba since he was 4 months old. Yes, he actually watched it. The music kept him happy when he was very young. He still watches it to this day. He sings the songs, dances with them and everything else. It's one of the lesser evils on TV for kids (my personal opinion).",Positive
"I didn't think it possible that another TV show would create another relationship with so much chemistry as the one Mulder and Scully shared. This is the kind of relationship where two people are perfect together in every single way, they fight for each other, the save each other and you know, deep down, that they belong together. Oh, and the sexual tension is so obvious everyone knows about it! And even though you live for the glances, for the touch of the hand, for a single kiss (The Santa in the Slush), you are still hesitant to see them romantically together. You don't want to mess up a perfect thing.Season 3 sees a lot of changes, the Gormogon storyline; Brennan's father, Max, finally goes to trial, Both and Brennan go through some very interesting psych therapy, Jack and Angela look to find the name of her husband and the team experiences loss. Although short (15 episodes), the season was quite good, with tons of surprises, chaos, and plenty interesting cases. Great season.This season really delves into the Booth and Brennan relationship starting with Brennan's antagonistic feelings against Booth and her reluctance to go into the field or work with him directly. This is all a result of the events ofBones Second Season. Things gets solved and their relationship is fixed; just in time to solve the next case. This is a great crime-solving duo that works great together.",Positive
"I enjoyed this show at several levels. First, Bram's Dracula has had quite a run in drama and comedy. This reimagining, though populated with familiar Stoker characters, is not your grandfather's Dracula. This Dracula is the bloodsucker in search of revenge against those who made him a vampire. Given that change, some other plot twists take Dracula completely away from Stoker and into a darker, savage, very sexy world of Victorian England. The actor playing Dracula is articulately played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. He holds it all together. Yet, did Rhys-Meyers not play with and against actors also giving excellent turns to their parts, set in lavish sets and locations such as Prague, I am certain this Dracula would be just savage and needlessly bloody. However, when excellent actors take up a role and the production values of the show are of the highest quality, rivaling the movies for sure, then you have an engaging and well presented program. I hope this Dracula survives to several more seasons.",Positive
"I love this English TV show that focuses on the lives of many inhabitants of 2 small towns side by side in the Victorian era.  The characters are lively, loveable and their stories are heart warming, family centered and honest.  So many refreshing universal truths are emphasized in each episode. The writing is delightful!  I'm sure this was a huge hit in Europe.",Positive
"A good show but it wears me out. Why? Because I lived kind of like that for a long time too. To me the whole &#34;homesteader experience&#34; (as shown on the program) is a perfect example of why people chose to live in civilization.  Is being able to live off the land admirable? Sure, when your on a desert island and can't do any thing else. This program is a perfect example of why cities and specialization prospers.It's also a visual tribute to how small decisions make BIG difference in life. Example? Sure,....How about the brother that didn't get enough wood chopped, or his garden harvested VS the one that did. Hummm...I have a brother just like that too..maybe you do too... So, interesting to see, but I've lived that life, and it's a LOT nicer to go to town every now and then, than it is to always have an endless list of projects that you need to do (and keep doing) just to keep warm, and fed.",Positive
"This show never gets old, predictable, or boring.Emily Rose is just fantastic.It makes you wonder what season five has in store.Can't wait.",Positive
"Odd characters, with phobias and fears, Lots of faults.  While this movie carries this to perhaps an extreme level, it helps us understand some of our own issues with dealing with other people",Negative
"I hope they don't take this one off the air, it really good and the story line is great. I love all the actor's and it's real.",Positive
Fun situations which include comedy and melodrama. Quick passage of time spent viewing and I enjoyed the series. Bring on the popcorn and your favorite beverage for a complete evening.,Positive
"I truly enjoyed the Cheech and Chong movies but, find most that try to use marijuana as the focus fall extremely short of the target. This series does just that, fell short at the starting line...",Negative
This episode was everything a long time fan could hope for. i hope everybody buys this so they continue to make more. seriously. jr is as good as ever.,Positive
"I love the hands on investigator part of the show & the gifted psychic part of the show. They collaborate so well! Did they only do 1 season of this incredible show? I have ""Dead Files Medium vs Detective Collection 1 but there are 2 DVD's for the collection! I want to find the other DVD to complete season 1. I love the dynamic!",Positive
"Initially I was irritated that I could only buy, not rent this movie. Now I'm so glad I have it, because it's in the ranks of the few that I'm sure to always return to, like Gozu, Audition, Serbian Film, C&eacute;line And Julia Go Boating, Hideki: Evil Dead Trap Two, Army of Darkness, Inland Empire. Very special movie.What's astonishing in this movie is not so much the fact that we see Scarlett Johansson with no clothes on (we do, though, a lot, and I'm not complaining) but the fact that we see her stripped bare of all her Hollywood artifice here. This has the feel of a real horror independent. I am definitely going to be following up on director Jonathan Glazer and screenwriter Walter Campbell, and novelis Michel Faber!",Positive
"they are polite, smart, cute, and kind...in a world filled with horror movies and violence, these guys are a nice option for the little ones.",Positive
"OH EM JEEE!This is the best show ever, with small baby fluffy animals, if you are slightly down, you will feel like you are lifted through the roof!After viewing for ten seconds, your face will look like this:  :DIt's great viewing for a family gathering, mafia meetings, divorce court, etc.After a tough day, I've learned it's either this or South Park. I need to either see some fluffy animals or laugh my face off. Or both.Too cute is flufffy baby puppies! OH MY GOD! :D",Positive
"This show is exciting and entertaining.  If you like the Vampire Diaries, the Originals is a must see!  I absolutely love it!",Positive
No super violence or stuff just for effect.  These are well told stories with solid character development and very entertaining.  The sprinkling of humor is well done and furthers the character development nicely.  Not your usual super hero fare with twisty story lines keeps it engaging and worth watching.,Positive
Great TV! So comforting to watch a cooking show that one has been watching for 15years and its quality and people have not changed! They answer many questions I have had about cooking over the years.. Not actors real people! Refreshing,Positive
"Seems at times like being behind the scenes of a Werner Herzog film. The play of the filming of Christopher Columbus' first voyage and its effect on the natives against the current plight of the Bolivian cast working in the film while at the same time fighting for access to water in their city is remarkably effective in demonstrating how little has changed over the centuries. Insightful, funny, passionate, touching, and ultimately uplifting.",Positive
"This is one of the best pilot episodes I've ever seen.  It has a unique mixture of ""The Newsroom"" style humour and ""Arrested Development"".  The entire cast is fantastic and the writing is too.  The characters seem fully-fleshed out from the very beginning of the episode.  This needs to get picked up.",Positive
"I enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 so much that I purchased season 3.  Wish they made more smart series like this one.  The show is elegant, with good looking actors and intelligent scripts. On season 3 the conflict is not just with clients but among the main characters, mergers and loyalty is tested. The hooks from one episode to the next are very well set, making you want to watch them all.",Positive
This is a gritty grimy battle ridden story or story novel about the myths and legends of the vikings.  It is a history fictional be it of how the vikings are and were.  Another hit by fx.,Positive
Really liked this program very much -- although the language isn't suited for families.  The acting is great and the story lines are very good.  Thank you Amazon for providing this program.,Positive
"This show is a nice modern update of the old &#34;Psycho&#34; movies with Norman & Norma Bates.  In some ways, the newer updates are cool and in others they kinda suck.  Overall though, this is a great show so far.  I have only seen episodes 1, 9, and 10.  I missed a lot of episodes because of streaming on PS3 and it is expensive to order every episode.  I was impressed with what I did see and hope this show can keep up.",Positive
"Wonderful series, wonderful Doctor, and a great Christmas special.  I really hope the Specials will continue to come out and we will get to see more of Matt Smith as the Doctor.  He filled all the previous Doctors's shoes and stretched them out a bit.  If you can ignore the 1 star reviews from short-sighted customers, get this.As fas as the 1 star reviews, I would have agreed that amazon charging for the sneek peek for the Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe was insane, but they figured it out as customers pointed it out to them, and they confirmed it was a mistake.  For the day it took them to fix this, I find that those that were so quick to complain openly instead of just reporting it to amazon and getting a refund, are way out of line.  I bought it, received a refund, didnt lose my tv pass, got the sneek peek back, and understand that things go wrong at times. It seems people forget that Amazon has the most amazing customer service out there and whine openly as soon as one thing goes wrong.  Your reviews complaining and giving one star are completely redundant now, but oh well.",Positive
"Tim Olyphant produces and stars in this and the storyline is excellent. The cast & locales are perfect! There is a brutally rough edge to the series but I cannot stop watching. Margo Martindale as Megs Bennet deserves an Emmy! WOW! First she is a warm, caring mother and then an evil crime boss taking a hammer to her children! Yeeesh!  No &#34;Apple Pie&#34; likker for me, thanks! Marshall Raylan Givens is no choirboy either! I wanna cheer for Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins) but then he &#34;does a 180degree&#34; turn too!  Every episode is a nail biter and then I found sympathy for Black Pike Mining Company 'cuz they are getting into bed with these people! WOW! Now I've gotta do season 3!",Positive
"I have been with Prime for a year now, and its been great for me to see movies and TV shows. That said; I didn't know about these new pilots until I watched a review on Revision 3. They were not kidding when they mentioned the quality of Betas...  I will recommend this to everyone I know, and a few that I don't, and I hope anyone looking for TV-like entertainment will check this out. It is better than most cable network shows, and as good as any huge production showing these days. With most networks choking out reality TV shows because they don't want to pay writers, this is a breath of air for me. I really hope Amazon picks this show up. I will defenately watch.",Positive
"Repetitive. Recovers too much of the ground it just did... This, I assume, is to remind the viewer, where the show left off before the commercials. Of course, on Amazon, there are no commercials, so it's annoying, and a so-called hour long show, already shortened to about 43 minutes, wastes several of those 43 on repeating. This is not unique to this show. Many, originally intended or shown on commercial television, do the same thing. I find it annoying, and feel cheated, that even 43 minutes is not truly 43 minutes of content, but more like 35. As for the show it's self, it makes too much drama out of minor things, and focuses on the squabbles, and seems to relish them. This is not what I want to see. (Too much of that in real life, I watch TV to get AWAY from real life!) The technical aspects of the job being done, however, are enough for me to give 4 stars. Barely.",Positive
"this is a great all around cooking show. Who could have imagined that a show could create such drama in the wake of Iron Chef, yet still be unique. though it is similar to Iron Chef, the format is much more fast paced and it draws upon non-celebrity chefs from around the world.",Positive
"This series was phenomenal!!!!! Glenn Close was awesome!  I ended up watching all the seasons, and was so disappointed that the show ended!",Positive
I don't know how long it will run...but it is sure to develop a cult following because of the quirky humor.,Positive
"Aww, man!  It's over.  This show was a thrill ride from the very beginning, to the very end.  I loved looking forward to how Scofield was gonna outsmart The Company every monday.  But unfortunately all good things must come to an end.  Prison Break season 4 is...interesting, to say the least.  If you are someone that watched from the start, you may be a little disappointed with how the show came to an end.  To me the last season was very unbalanced.  The writing was all over the place.  Starting with the re-emergence of Sarah and Scofield's sudden illness.  Plus how T-Bag after three seasons, develops a heart.  I'm sayin', come on!  Although I have to give all the actors credit for making entertainment out of what those wacky writers scripted.  I thought The General's performance was exceptional as usual!!! As well as Gretchen.  She is definitely a force to be reckoned with.  If you are someone that enjoys quality acting and intense drama than this is for you.  Prison Break will always be remembered by me.  It was a GREAT show with a very imaginative story line!!!!!!!!",Positive
In my opinion the most solid of all the seasons.  Season four did a great job of developing the story arc and humanizing the characters while staying light hearted and fun.  This show has an addictive quality.  I especially enjoy the way Jim always makes an arrest in the middle of some public event at least once in every episode.  Great fun show.,Positive
"Fun, Interesting  show to watch. It's Sometimes a little dramatic but I have fun watching it while I cook :)",Positive
"It's too bad that Alcatraz was cancelled after its first year due to low viewing. Seems that American TV is doomed to be dumbed down forever.One can still get it online fortunately. It's offbeat, sinister, and really weird. It's also well acted and directed. It's as much sci-fi as a crime story. We'll now never know why things happened, but I can think of a few things which I don't want to share and spoil this show for readers.The one criticism I have of the show is that every episode runs a bit too strictly to pattern, sort of like &#34;Dragnet.&#34; But &#34;Dragnet&#34; lasted for years, as this should have. There was much room for development and growth.",Positive
"If like me, you watch the season all at once, be aware of the season ending cliff hanger - you won't want to wait to fnd out what's going to happen next.  I am still trying to decide if I like Castle and Beckett dating - it generally works (but not always).",Positive
"The episodes are so interesting.  They take simple things we all know and shed light on the many mysteries of not only the past, but the present as well.  The teamwork between Buddy, Mac, and Scott is amazing.  The way they put the pieces together themselves that alone they might have overlooked.  I really hope we get a season 3!",Positive
I found this series to be well presented with an informative history of the times. It held my interest to the end.,Positive
"I didn't know what to expect when I first started watching this series, but now I am hooked. I love the characters they have created and the story lines they supply.  Definitely worth watching.",Positive
Enjoyed season 2 but thought the main character was starting to look a old for the part and definitely heavier.,Positive
This series should still be on but it ended. Don't miss it though. Interesting plot and great characters.  Loved it.,Positive
This is really slow paced show but it is interesting.  These people have developed systems to make it on their own which I find rather amazing.,Negative
"I am a Guy, and I LOVE this series!It would really do a disservice to this wonderful series if it became known only as a ""chick show"".I can understand why women love this show - but men will also fall in love with the quirky residents of Blue Bell Alabama.This has to be one of the most well written television series of this decade. The characters are real. Episodes build upon each other so that you really come to feel as if you are a resident of this lovely little Southern Town.I highly recommend this series, but please do yourself a favor and watch the episodes in order from the very start.",Positive
"Hello Writers stop the stupidity !!!  Please do not JUMP THE SHARK ....Austin from Houston is 183 miles unless you are driving 90 miles an hour you are not 2 hours away.  Other junk about the wellsite was just too stupid for words.  But the entire lighting the water faucet what an absurdity.  Please do not ruin this series - has been a bit of fun for me each week !Earlier, in 'Golden Hammer' was bad enough looking at the landscape photos where actual hills were portrayed in Houston.  HILLS????? really ??  , however, one can bypass that part as not significant to the story line.",Negative
All time favorites.  A continuation of the first season - greater expansion of characters.  It's the bomb. Love love this series.,Positive
"I have not read the book, so I have nothing to compare this too.  I can tell you it is a well developed plot with great character building.  You already start to feel for Bosch after the first episode.  You want him to succeed, win the case and be the hero.  Kudos to the writers and the actors who brought just another cop,show to life.  I also enjoy the detailed forensics work.  Interesting what you can learn!Can't wait for the full season....please pick them up!",Positive
Cool show with quirky characters and off the wall plot but fun to watch (for me),Positive
"This four part British series about a heist gone wrong starts out so strong, it's difficult to maintain the incredible initial intensity throughout.  But anyone who likes contemporary crime drama should definitely check out ""Inside Men.""  This series has a refreshingly hard edge.  Its central protagonists are not unscrupulous villains, but ordinary men looking for a shortcut to a better life.  As two lower level employees (Warren Brown and Ashley Walters) at a money counting house look to skim from the take, they don't realize that this risky caper is going to open the door to something unfathomable.  When discovered by their supervisor (Steven Mackintosh), his response is not what they would have predicted.  Soon these three ""inside men"" are plotting a scheme that will net them millions!  And as you might expect, it's not easy to plan the perfect crime.The narrative is divided into two timelines that alternate back and forth within a given episode.  The series starts in the midst of the big heist, and the other plot line backtracks to many months before the event.  Not only, therefore, are we seeing the present-day heist spin out of control, we are seeing the tumultuous days leading up to the event.  The actual action sequences are extremely well done and exciting, while the planning stage is also fraught with tension.  All of the men have women and/or families that figure into the scenario in one way or another (kudos to Kierston Wareing, so good in The Take, for channeling her best Lady MacBeth as Brown's girlfriend).  The beauty of this story is that you really never know where it is going.  Having seen the heist in the opening episode, there are still plenty of surprises once the back story catches up and gives us a fresh perspective on what's going on.The pacing of ""Inside Men"" is fast and frenetic and it works so well due to the performances.  Walters is quite solid as the emerging conscience of the group, while Brown is more impetuous.  But, for me, this is Mackintosh's show.  His character arc plays out similarly to Bryan Cranston's in Breaking Bad (although obviously not in as much depth).  Starting as the idealization of a perfect professional family man, his increasing detachment and willingness to explore the darkness of his soul are riveting to watch.  If ""Inside Men"" has any flaws, it is that it comes to a rather hasty conclusion.  Seriously.  When the final episode was over, I actually didn't realize that was the end of the series.  I thought there were more episodes.  Don't get me wrong, things come to a resolution--but it also would have been easy to keep the story continuing.  But that's something I like about British TV (as opposed to American), they aren't boxed into a certain number of shows.  ""Inside Men,"" therefore, doesn't get a chance to burn itself out.  It's just quick, gritty, and memorable. 4 1/2 stars.  KGHarris, 8/12.",Positive
"The story lines are well acted and thought out but our main character lets his emotions get him. I like the multi plot lines and hints of intrigue to come.i only wish there were most epeisodes as ther is a lot to uncover in the town by Jack,.",Positive
I like it because it shows more realistic where Caillou has to learn by failure.My daughter likes it because he experiments new things.My son correlate him to this character.,Positive
"the show is fast paced, no commercials, good characters. It is probably truer than we'd like to think that it  is.",Positive
Whether you share their particular beliefs or not let your inner red neck flag fly because this show is too funny to miss!,Positive
nothing really too special ...but it is rather etertaining.....wouldnt buy it but its included in prime so i watch from time to time,Negative
"OVERVIEW:  The premise of ""South Park"" was conceived by creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker in the early 1990s.  Due to its viral-video success, Comedy Central picked up the rights to the franchise and aired the first episode of the adult animated series in 1997.  The cartoon garnered fame as one of the first shows to hinge its comedy on the use of crude language, satirical storylines, and dark humor.  Set in South Park, Colorado, the main characters of the show--Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick--often parody the childhoods of their writers.SPECIAL FEATURES of the Season 15 box-set include deleted scenes, ""6 Days to Air:  The Making of `South Park,'"" ""6 Days to Air:  Behind the Scenes of `City Sushi,'"" and ""Commentary-Mini.""  If you have never watched the episodes with ""Commentary Mini,"" I encourage you to do so; the short commentaries from Trey Parker and Matt Stone are optionally run during the first three minutes of each episode.  Parker and Stone have used this method of commentary since the early seasons.  Their short introductions often expose insights behind particular jokes, further multiplying the laugh count.SEASON 15 kicked off in the spring of 2011 with fourteen episodes, each written during the week before broadcast.  In true ""South Park"" style, some of the pop-culture references of this season include:  The Royal Wedding, the History Channel, ""The Matrix,"" U.S./Mexico Border Security, DeVry University, Wiki-Leaks, Steve Jobs/Apple, Asperger's Syndrome, Broadway Theater, ""The Human Centipede,"" Comedy Central's First Annual Comedy Awards, the NCAA, Veganism, and the War on Wall Street.  I have been a fan of ""South Park"" since its beginning and religiously purchase each season; however, I feel that the show's wit and charm has been in a slump since season 14.  While I still find the show highly entertaining, much of the recent comedy has felt `forced.'  I am happy to say that the writing seems to pick back up in Season 16 and is nearly fully-operational by Season 17.EPISODES:  In the middle of the 15th Season, the episode ""You're Getting Old"" gave the implication to many viewers that Stone and Parker may have used the plot as an allegory for expressing their feelings about the direction of the ""South Park"" series.  Because the later seasons failed to impress long-time viewers, the fear of an impending end to ""South Park"" only gained steam.  By the end of Season 15, Comedy Central had announced an extension to Stone and Parker's contract which promises to carry the series into 2016 (Season 20), thus subsiding the worry of dedicated fans.Episode 1:  ""HUMANCENTiPAD""--When Cartman doesn't get the iPad he has been bragging about, he starts a campaign against his mother; Kyle fails to iTunes updates before agreeing to them.Episode 2:  ""Funnybot""--Jimmy names the Germans as the world's least funny people during the school Comedy Awards; Germany retaliates by producing a funny robot.Episode 3:  ""Royal Pudding""--Canadians around the world tune in to watch the royal marriage, as is tradition.  But when the new princess is kidnapped, Canada is left in a state of chaos... as is tradition.Episode 4:  ""T.M.I.""--When the school posts the students' height differentials, Cartman misinterprets the `objects' measured.Episode 5:  ""Crack Baby Athletic Association""--Cartman exploits the entertainment quality of crack-babies, creating a lucrative business venture the Kyle cannot resist.Episode 6:  ""City Sushi""--Big-Rig Butters, Inspector Butters, Marjorine, Professor Chaos, and Leopold Stotch are discovered to have a single unifying quality:  Butters.  To avoid being grounded, Butters must sort out his multiple personality disorder.Episode 7:  ""You're Getting Old""--Stan becomes more cynical with age leading to a breakup with Kyle.  Sharon and Randy separate so Randy can pursue his dreams as `Steamy Ray Vaughn.'Episode 8:  ""Azz Burgers""--Due to an onset of antisocial behavior, Stan is believed to have Asperger's Syndrome.  With Kyle's help, Cartman opens a business called Cartman Burger.Episode 9:  ""The Last of the Meheecans""--In an elaborate came of capture-the-flag, Butters becomes trapped in Mexico and earns the alias `Mantequilla.'  Cartman joins the U.S. Border Patrol to prevent Butters from crossing back over as well as to seal his win.Episode 10:  ""Bass to Mouth""--A gossip website exposes the private e-mails and phone conversations of South Park students; the boys orchestrate a plan to bring the hacker to justice.Episode 11:  ""Broadway Bro Down""--[Episode co-written by Robert Lopez]  Randy becomes a Broadway enthusiast after discovering theater's subconscious effect on Sharon.Episode 12:  ""1%""--Cartman's scores on the Presidential Fitness Test destroy the entire school's average.Episode 13:  ""A History Channel Thanksgiving""--The boys stumble on a conspiracy theory concerning aliens, ghosts, and the first Thanksgiving.Episode 14:  ""The Poor Kid""--When Kenny and his siblings are shuffled into foster care, Cartman becomes the poorest kid in class.",Positive
"An incredible combination of story, script, cast and production.  I know I'm going to be laughing in a minute, but it won't arrive before a tension filled plot line.  I'm rooting for both good guys/gals and the bad guys/gals.  This is something I don't usually do.  Must be a great show.",Positive
"Who doesn't love this program ? We all know that we watch every single moment with baited breath just waiting for the strike ! Or perhaps the flying great whites of S Africa , who couldn't watch that action all day long ? Kick back relax and enjoy the episodes , all nice and lovely in HD and with no commercials to suffer thru , win win !!",Positive

"I enjoy the slower, thoughtful drama with interesting characters. I especially like the fact that guns aren't used, or even seen.Characters are realistic, not perfect, not all nice:human.",Positive
"I have always tried to watch this movie every Christmas since I was a teenager.  I am so busy now, that I have trouble watching it on TV. I rented this movie and watched it on my PC when I had some free time. Very good quality.",Positive
"I must admit that I was one of the original kids in the late 70's/ early 80's, who was obsessed with everything to do with VHS, video stores and movies. I even tried to persuade my parents into opening a video store. it began my legit collecting obsession. So I worked to buy used VHS movies.By 1994 I had well over 2,000 pre recorded movies. Then in 1997, DVD was introduced and unlike Blu Ray, it was a game changer for me. Over the course of the next 5 years, I upgraded to DVD, and while I knew many of my obscure VHS titles would probably never see the light of day due to either licensing agreements, lack of popularity or whatever, I was into DVD and quick and glad to abandon VHS and all of it's imperfections (drop outs, frayed tape, degraded picture with every viewing, poor audio; nothing like a cat purring sound in surround, horrible pan & scanned videos in glorious 240 lines of resolution,etc.).. A few dozen titles were never upgraded, but with the help of technology and a DVD Recorder, they were upgraded, the labels and boxes were stripped and converted for use on the new personal/private DVD version.As some of these titles have eeeked out in the past few years, I then replaced those too... I have been VHS free since 2006 and there isn't a day that goes by where I lament the format that spurred my life's passionate hobby. I doubt that people wish they could go back to black & white TV's, anymore than I want to go back to that over sized & bulky 1979 RCA 2 Head Mono VCR that sat in our living room on top of the console TV.. I have fond memories of those years, but things are now better. I am in agreement with a few of the people that were  interviewed, that Blu Ray, or ""Boo Ray"", as one guy put it, sucks and is going to die out.DVD still outsells Blu, and at the end of the day, it does comes down to ""control of content"". Blu Ray was a device created to prevent piracy, control special features and to charge a little more per disc, because DVD's copy protection was easy to circumvent and Wal Mart and other discount stores drove DVD's prices so low, it made the DVD brand nearly worthless for the studios, profit wise. However, there's a reason Blu Ray hasn't taken off, despite hybrid combo packs and recent low prices - the format is greed, and the public doesn't care.As far as the movie goes, I thought it was just okay. It spent way too much time veering off into sub subjects (Japanese culture, people making their own home movies with a camcorder, etc.) that it didn't really keep me focused all the way though. I did enjoy hearing about how mass merchants rejected art based covers from their store and tend to agree with the people in the film, that part of the excitement of going to the video store and selecting videos was sometimes based solely on the box artwork... But this was a small part in the film and just as it got interesting, it got bland again.. Also, there wasn't really any mention of the 1984 supreme court case which ruled in favor of time shift recording, while it kept hinting at that subject when talking about recording.There was one small part where digital copies (like UltraViolet) are the next big thing, and I also tend to agree, because of the quality, accessibility on multiple platforms and devices, and the big NOW factor. I am concerned as was another guy in the movie, that again, this could just be a control of content mess.. and after I, myself, did a little research and asked questions, I discovered the following: Amazon, of course, unfortunately, does NOT support the UltraViolet program, so you do run the risk of having any digital video content become ""unavailable"" at a third party's discretion..until said content is then renewed by Amazon. I found this highly troubling, and again, as mentioned in the movie, goes against the spirit of what it means to ""purchase"" something. If something can be given and taken away, you're just renting it.. So this is another medium that is either going to sink or swim based on user control.This part resonated with me, and it's why I have only 40 Amazon Digital movie titles and over 1,200 on Vudu with most being UltraViolet compatible.. Which, btw, is where I purchased and saw this movie (Rewind This).. Last summer I had spoken to people at Vudu and mentioned Amazon's 3rd party position and asked what their policy was regarding purchased content vs. it no longer being available to sell, I was told several times, that your purchased content and UV library is forever yours to view and download. It just wouldn't be available for new people to rent or purchase. So this helped me make my decision to take advantage of the UV digital copy wave; and I've been aggressively building this virtual library over the past 9 months..Side note: If a title is UltraViolet compatible, you can access it on multiple platforms like Roku, PS4, X-Box, most content enabled Blu Rays, smart TV's, Smart Phones or a computer through any of the participating UV partners (Vudu,CinemaNow,Target Ticket, Nook Video, M Go, Flixster, etc.) providing said partner carries that title at their location.. Oh, and accessing and watching your library on these platforms never costs a cent, because it's your content.I recently had a chance to see this policy first-hand in December; I went to watch a few of my Christmas movies and went to search for ""Surviving Christmas""(don't judge me, I pay my bills..and I happen to like the movie).. Last Summer I had done a low cost disc to digital DVD to HDX upgrade on this tile. The movie could not be found on Vudu ""for sale or rent"", nor on a few of the other UV partner sites(for whatever reason).. but I checked my UV library titles,and sure enough, the movie was there in my Vudu library, so I immediately watched it. UtraViolet purchased titles are in fact different from what's offered for sale on Amazon Digital.. You can download both for indefinite viewing, but Amazon's Digital contracts suggest instability issues..If I want to run the risk of movies disappearing on a whim, I'd still be with Netflix.. This film (Rewind) didn't really get into that either, though hinted at the topic.There's so many other things I want to banter on about, and while I wanted to love this movie for it's geekiness, history and delving into a world I'm so familiar with and love; I wanted to hear more stories from other true collectors and even strangers regarding their collecting and renting habits.. or even a mention of how Paramount first started renting their videos through Photo huts film kiosks where you'd get a catalog similar to the old Columbia House catalog and call and reserve a movie and then go pick it up..This is how I first saw Saturday Night Fever when I was 10... However,after viewing Rewind This twice (had to view it again to be fair, since I hated it the first time for being so touch and go), it just didn't hit a home run or even merit all of these good reviews. There were too many cooks in the kitchen, not enough experience or spice. Rewind This left me feeling bland, hungry and disappointed with it's many missed opportunities. Another odd part was the guy who remembers the ""be kind, rewind"" stickers as something warm. It wasn't supposed to be cute, it was so the next person renting didn't have to spend time doing what the previous person should have done. Moreover, those stickers usually said you were getting charged a buck per video if returning the video without rewinding it.. fees are so warm and cute.....It's nice to think about the past, but the past is now the past, however, most of the same movies are still here, and for the most part, they look better than they ever did on VHS and that's the point. The movies themselves remind me of the past, not the crappy format. That's where this film drops the ball. We had HBO back in the early 80's, and the signal was really horrible, but I never sit around wishing to watch Friday the 13th with snow and static all over the screen.. Nor does this movie make me want to hit the thrift stores, flea markets and dirty junk piles for old VHS ""gold"", especially in a po dunk shacks charging $9 or $10 per VHS tape regardless of the title because some nostalgic saps who ""love pan & scan movies over original aspect ratio versions"" and think ""DVD is broke 'cause it's got them black bars on the top and the bottom of my TV"" or that VHS is like Vinyl - ""it's gonna make a come back!""... No, no it's not.. but thanks, have at it. I'll gladly stick with DVD and UltraViolet.",Negative

"When I saw the pilot of Season 1 of Falling Skies, I was hooked!  What's not to like?  Robot apocalypse, a family trying to survive and an army of the human resistance.  I enjoyed all of season 1 and watched deep into season 2 before starting to get bored.  Season 3 seemed to stall with its complex story and multiple character plots.  I deem myself a Falling Skies fan, and have loved the show until now, but I'm not sure if I'll continue into next season.  Almost Human has taken over my robot fix for now, but maybe I'll be surprised when Season 4 airs this summer.For fans of Battlestar Galactica, Terminator, and Almost Human.",Negative
"While entertaining, this season seems more contrived than others.  The personal ties from earlier seasons added continuity to the episodes. These connections are often missing on the college campus.  Still the series is entertaining.",Negative
This was the episode about the death of Finn and Cory. it was so well done. But sad. We will forever remember Cory. RIP.,Positive
"OK, while we (my husband and I) both miss Ziva, she's one hard act to follow, this show still rocks! It has everything a good show needs. Drama, suspense, laughter, great plot lines, excellent writing, you name it they've got it. We've pretty much purchased all of the episodes from season 1 through season 10 and a few from season 11. This is our &#34;go to&#34; tv show for nights at home when we're not in the mood for a movie. This show literally has the perfect cast, well, minus one with Ziva missing, but still, the rest are awesome. I can't recommend this show highly enough! It's a must watch!",Positive
"Unenlightened drivel, acting high brow.  Full of foul language throughout, as far as I know (I couldn't finish the last fourth of the movie because I was so offended by the continued foul language and intolerance of religious persons).  I was hoping it would get better s it went along, showing the professor and his students were mistaken in their beliefs.  But alas they never learned the truth because they did not even want to believe there is truth.  What kept me going for as long as I did was seeing how these atheists act and think.  It did remind me of the bullying done at universities to Christians.",Negative
"I am a deadwood fan, So Timothy Olyphant playing a US marshal is a no brainer. He was excellent as Seth bullock, And just as good as Raylon. I like the writing in this series, All the actors are very convincing. The setting is in Kentucky and if you think hillbillys are dumb, You would be wrong.",Positive
I love this show! Very real and Very scary. Not to be taken lightly for sure. I know if I viewed this as a kid and even after I would be very scared.  If you like paranormal shows I vote this one in the top 2...I guess top 1 right now for me.,Positive
Daria was one of the most witty and intelligent shows on the air back in the late 90s. I'd recommend this to anyone that grew up with a bit of an sideways look at high school.,Positive

Since it was available online I checked it out. My friend was right. I love this show now and really need to catch up for next season.",Positive
"I think this show is well cast with interesting plots that will intrigue any and all real, everyday parents.  The acting is superb.  The viewer will be happy,  sad,  angry and joyful during these episodes,  just as good tv entertainment should inspire.",Positive
Was surprised with the first season.  A little disappointed in the arch villain.  Just down right boring and annoying.  An arch Villain should be remember not one that I want to forget about quickly.  The series itself is great.  Season 2 so far has made no exception.  Good show.  So far so good no Arch Villain.  Haven't gotten to whole season yet.,Positive
"House is my favorite show, combining the drama, tension and intelligence of a amazing medical series with believability, quirkiness, oddities, subtle humor, endearing charm and wonderful casting.",Positive
I only watched 1-1/2 episodes of this show.  I did not find it interesting or entertaining.  I don't recommend it.,Negative
Loved this show. I hate that it was cancelled. I like the shows theme and the smart people. All the members are smart. I love it. No stupid-b----e style.,Positive
"i really enjoyed the first 4 seasons. it seems like the cast  lost interest in season 5,the scripts were very bad.",Negative
Awesome show! Events from the 80's are brought out in the show and  show what the Cold War affects could have been.  Also relates how life styles could be for the spies who had families.,Positive
"Post Jack the Ripper, the second season focuses on another famous villain (or pair of villains),  the Crays.One tends to equate extreme violence with the USA.  It is refreshing to see just how bloody the Brits can be!! This series is not for the squeamish nor for those who are like - minded. Sadly, much of this violence is likely to thrill too many persons with poor impulse control. Hence I give it 4 stars.",Positive
"This is an 80's family sitcom. Mostly entertaining, while exploring family values and issues of the day. It's great to have on in the background.",Negative
"I was skeptical about renting this at first since I knew this type of movie would be slow and the whole found footage thing doesn't really help either but once I read that this movie was based on real life events such as the Jonestown Massacre of 1978, I decided to give it a rent since I am a sucker for films that are based on true/real/etc events or whatever. I don't want to spoil too much except that it's a good film and if you enjoyed the ORIGINAL wicker man movie (not the Nicolas Cage release the bees edition) then you will probably enjoy this film! It's not the best movie of the year but its nice to see a different change of pace for horror/thriller films these days. Its creepy to think that you could be held against your own will in some village that seems like a wonderful place to live when it really isn't.",Positive
so much going on this season... cant believe the intensity of the players this season!!!I think it better than all other seasons...,Positive
"Shannon Beador is so negative and obnoxious I think she has ruined the rest of the season for me. Quote from Shannon &#34;I'm a hopeful and positive person&#34;? Really? Do you hear the horrible things that fly out of your mouth every time you open it? She is so hardcore and cold & ALWAYS angry, how did this woman get cast on the show? Please replace with someone bright & positive like Lizzie! Now she's fun, positive & upbeat!Shannon seems to enjoy ragging on everyone around her and finding an excuse to be miserable at every event!! GO AWAY! You're ruining the show!",Negative
I love watching police and detective show and this is a good one to watch.  The story line keeps a good pace and the actors do a good job.,Positive
"Just an OK show not really my type. However, I can see how others would like it.  The plot moves slow.",Negative
This show is awesome. Every time I watch an episode I have to watch the next one. Very interesting show.,Positive
"First - Keri Russell can really kick but while still maintaining her ""spy life"" as a wife with 2 kids.  Matthew Rhys playa her tough and mysterious ""husband.""The storyline is Homeland meets 1980's Cold War.  The suspense is good - Homeland being the better though.  What I like the most is that they're able to create a 80's atmosphere.  So this is a good show to watch while waiting for Homeland to start up again.",Positive
"I'm not quite sure what put me off but I'm leaning towards the obnoxiously self centered adult children.  The transvestite father, the unhappily married daughter reconnecting with her college lesbian lover, the idiot son, and the youngest daughter with more issues than Time.  Quite a cast of characters to work with.  Just didn't work for me.  Maybe if they humanize those insufferable adult brats.",Negative
We love all the characters.  They all have their own special eccentricities.  And it's interesting learning to think of Wales as some foreign country to the British!,Positive
"Don't read any spoilers as this movie keeps you guessing as long as possible.  A married couple face intense sexual temptations on a night apart.  The wife has strong emotional ties to her ex.  The husband has none but is intoxicated by the beauty of a female co-worker.  Both of the unmarried people are smooth operators that imply no strings attached.  If either spouse cheats, which would be the most toxic to the marriage?  The movie wisely leaves this unanswered.",Positive
This is a well written show.  I die laughing at almost every episode.  The writers did a great job of melding all of the dysfunctional characters together.  A must watch.,Positive
Haven is a awesome series. Stephen King is awesome. I love anything and everything Stephen King. I have all three seasons and they are all awesome.,Positive
A subtle beginning that builds to an exciting finish. Plus it has a great cast. I look forward to the next one.,Positive
"It definitely started off pretty strong, but it gets a little slow toward the end. It's a pretty high quality crime show with very excellent actors and clever dialog. I hope amazon would pick it up, this show has a pretty good potential.I'd say that this is the same level of quality of a network or cable show, but not qute and HBO level yet, but if the show got picked up for a whole season, usually crime show like this gets better as the episode progresses.",Positive
The acting is superb and the plots are intriguing and realistic.  This is an excellent program and I highly endorse it.,Positive
"A good cop show taking place just before civil war is over - 1860's New York.  An American-Irish cop patrolling the 5 points of New York.  When it comes to the law, Corcoran isn't always an angel.  Kevin'll steal from crocks, but he does want justice for the guilty and protection for all the innocents.An all star cast.  Tom Weston-Jones (MI-5Episode 1) as Kevin Corcoran. Anastasia Griffith (Once Upon a Time: The Complete First Season) as the wealthy and ignorant Elizabeth Haverford.Franka Potente, in my opinion, is the big star of the show.  (Run Lola RunandThe Bourne Identity) She plays the Madam Eva Heissen.The characters are well developed and believable.  The plot suspense is good and each episode with a new plot twist.  I recommend this show to all those who enjoy a good cop show or 1860 New York 5 points gangs period piece.",Positive
"This is an unconventional historical documentary. It combines narration, re-creation and commentary by any number of people including large numbers of high-profile people in business. It tells the history of a complicated era (the industral revolution in post-civil war America) from the perspective of those who led it. It makes for compelling viewing in that its always presenting things from an understandable individual point of view. But at a price.While the program is extremely watchable, its often playing fast-and-loose with history. Sometimes its only telling part of a story. An example is the struggle over the Erie railroad. While it leaves the impression that Jay Gould cleanly beat Vanderbilt, the actual story is a whole lot more mixed. The business relationship between Carnegie and Frick is told somewhat from a self-serving Carnegie point of view. They go even so far as to hold Frick personally, directly and exclusively responsible for the Johnstown flood. As for Carnegie, the flood is presented as a moment of complete moral transformation leading to the construction of Carnegie Hall. While doting on Carnegie Hall, they fail to even realize that at about the same time Rockefeller was creating the much more ambitious project of the University of Chicago.There is a certain danger in presenting these stories mostly from the point of view of the winners of the era. It edges toward boosterism (and that is perhaps being too kind).There are some commentators I could have done without. Alan Greenspan, Jim Kramer, Donald Trump and Mark Cuban come to mind.",Negative
"ANGELS CREST is not a perfect movie: there are so many undeveloped sidebars that keeping everyone in a place where they seem to fit into the tale is difficult.  But there are some powerful performances here and some cause for reflection that makes the movie very worthwhile watching. Based on the novel by the same name written by Leslie Schwartz, adapted for the screen by Catherine Trieschmann, and directed by Gaby Dellal, the story deals with numerous interactions of a small town populated with alcoholics, drug abusers, adulterers, and other strange types and how they deal with a tragedy that makes no sense.Nate Denton (Ameko Eks Mass Carroll) is a 3 year old son of Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekkar in a breakout performance that deserves attention) who awakens one morning in his pathetic home to tell his beloved single dad that it is snowing.  The father/son bond is strong and Ethan dresses them both to go out to view the beauty of the snowy countryside in their old truck.  When they arrive at a perfect spot, Ethan turns to the backseat to take Nate out to make snowmen, but Nate has fallen asleep in this safety car seat.  Ethan makes the truck warm, locks the truck and walks out to view the spectacle of winter, the deer, and the eloquent mountains.  In a few minutes he returns - and Nate is gone!  Ethan is terrified, begins shouting his son's name as he searches for him.  The town is alerted and a search party begins.  Nate's mother alcoholic mother Cindy (Lynn Collins) is notified of Nate's missing and begins her tirade on every person she meets.  After an overnight search for Nate, Ethan discovers Nate's frozen body and is devastated. Ethan is taken into custody for a death stemming from negligence and the townspeople form sides as to Ethan's guilt.  Among them is a waitress Angie (Mira Sorvino) and her small daughter Rosie (Emma Macgillivray), Ethan's friend Rusty (Joseph Morgan), a lesbian couple (Elizabeth McGovern and Kate Walsh), Cindy's preachy  mother (Barbara Williams). and the local police.  The town brings in the District Attorney (Jeremy Piven) who obviously has secrets of his won that mirror Ethan's crisis.  The story is resolved in a strange and tragic manner, leaving many crises unsolved.Thomas Dekkar gives such a fine performance that we are able to see inside his heart and head and soul.  The supporting cast conveys the small town response to a tragedy among their own - who is guilty of what and how could the incident have ever occurred.  There are many ideas created by the writers and the characters that are never realized fully, but the sense of human response to an accident is staggeringly real.  There is much more to this film in retrospect, after watching it, that haunts the viewer.  Grady Harp, December 11",Positive
"I really like the medical science mysteries and this one has my attention!  I keep trying to figure out what's the motives behind what's going on.  I marvel @ the actors rattling off all the tongue twisting jargon.  Some scenes are rather disturbing, but also a sobering reminder of how somethings can go very wrong.. fast.",Positive
I found this to be a very intense mini-series where everybody must have an ID card to exist.  I was looking forward to the next segment each time and was disappointed that it ended.,Positive
"I've watched all seasons.  While this season is not as good seasons past, I refuse to give up on it!  I still miss George!",Positive
Many movies have been made regarding some of these &#34;Secrets&#34;.  Having been raised in the DC area it was interesting to me that a lot are based in facts.,Positive
"Key & Peel is such a funny show!  I love how offbeat their humor is.  So many of their sketches start out totally traditional, but then take turn for Crazy Town.  They catch me off guard and either make me laugh or wonder what just happened.",Positive
"This fun tv show that intermixes fairy tales and classic  stories to make a interesting fantasy show is a hit show for abc. In this episode Regina is framed for murdering jimminy cricket. She's set up by her mom and from this point on we begin to see her perhaps return to being more evil. Not that she wasn't evil in the first series, she killed a man by squeezing his heart to pieces in that season. The second season is as good as the first one and it's different in many ways. You do need to see the first season to understand the story arc.",Positive
This is a relatively good scifi series. Some times it is a little hard to follow and sometimes it seems to get into back stories that don't seem related. But it holds your attention.,Negative
"I love the actors in this version. I get more invested in the show each season. There are a lot of twists which, I guess, would come from having ghost, vampires and werewolves all packed into one show in leading roles. That sounds as though it could be overwhelming and dark. Which, if the writing failed, it would be. However the writing holds up, the actors work well with each and the show has a family, albeit a strange one, feel to it. There is enough reality blended with fantasy that makes it work. The bits of comedy sprinkled throughout keeps it from getting too dark. It may be a bit graphic and scary for young ones.",Positive
"I don't have television, haven't for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.I really wish Amazon Unbox would allow me to burn shows I've purchased. As it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer. When Unbox expands this service to allow me to burn DVDs I will likely purchase many more shows this way. I like selecting individual shows.",Positive
"While some of the jokes were uniquely funny, many felt forced or even over-the-top. This show might have potential for a single season, but I can't see it developing any further then that.",Negative
"Guillermo Del Toro, the director of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""Hellboy"", seems determined to revive the ghost story. Quite frankly, we need it. Too many `horror' films are excuses for filmmakers to throw buckets of blood and gore at the screen, hurling everything at us in an attempt to see what sticks, or more appropriately, what makes us sick. Gone are the suspense and terror filmmakers like Hitchcock (""Psycho""), Robert Wise (""The Haunting"") and John Carpenter (the original ""Halloween"") who created films with such skill, riveting us to our seats and scaring us away from showers, dark houses and babysitters. Now, `horror' films seem determined to use as many special effects as possible to recreate the goriest, most vial displays. How is this suspenseful or frightening? It is merely sickening.So, it was especially nice to see ""The Orphanage"", a truly creepy, scary ghost story produced by Del Toro and directed by JA Bayona.A brief prologue introduces us to the Orphanage, situated near the ocean. The headmistress takes a phone call and it becomes apparent Laura, who is outside playing with the other five children in the home, will soon be leaving her friends for the comfort of a new family. Many years later, Laura (Belen Rueda), returns to the orphanage with her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their adopted son, Simon (Roger Princep). Laura and her husband have purchased the building and are renovating it to care for five or six children ""with special needs"". As the renovations continue, Simon makes a new invisible friend and begins talking with him. This is really nothing new for Laura and Carlos, Simon has other invisible friends, so they aren't really concerned. But when Laura takes Simon down to the beach, and they explore the caves, Laura begins to suspect something is different. During the party, to celebrate the opening of their house, Laura has a run in with a strange child wearing a scarecrow mask and Simon disappears. Laura and Carlos search desperately for Simon, following every lead and looking everywhere. They meet a man who agrees to help and brings in a medium, Aurora (Geraldine Chaplin, Charlie's daughter). Infrared equipment is set up everywhere and they watch Aurora's every move as she tries to communicate with the spirits, the presence she feels. After a particularly harrowing moment, she comes back to the present and tells them they have many spirits roaming the house. Six to be precise. As Laura becomes more and more determined to find Simon, she also begins to unravel the secrets behind the other visitors in the house.""The Orphanage"" isn't so much about horror, or shock value, as it is about setting the mood for events that will transpire, creating suspense. From the moment Laura, Carlos and Simon return to the orphanage, to set up their home, we know they have made a bad decision. Why would Laura want to return to the orphanage where she grew up, to set up her new home? This seems strange at first. Was she drawn back to this place? Is there some tie with it, making her return? Then, we learn of Laura and Carlos' plan to reopen the home and care for children with development problems and disabilities. Laura wants to give back some of the help and kindness she received as a child, leading her to take on this huge task.As Laura and Carlos go about setting up this house, they try to provide a normal family life for Simon. But Simon has special needs of his own, and they try to deal with, and address these needs. They try to go about their normal activities, but every time they hear a crash, Laura stops and shudders, not from fright, but because some worker somewhere has probably cost her some more money or delay the project. This is a great way for the filmmakers to divert attention, to give us some false chills, and make the real scares even better.As they get settled in, and begin to explore the grounds. Laura tells Simon about the lighthouse just a bit away, and how she and the other children used to find comfort in it's light. She and Simon spend a lot of time together and begin to explore the grounds. One day, as they enter a cave on the beach, Simon tells his mother of his new friend. Laura has clearly heard of other invisible friends in Simon's life and seems to give it little regard, until he runs off and she sees two sets of footprints.When they are ready to open the house to the other children, they throw a party to welcome everyone. But Simon disappears and Laura has a run-in with a child wearing an old smock, like she wore at the orphanage when she was a child. More bothersome, the child is also wearing a burlap mask with a big smile painted on. Who is this child?When they realize Simon is gone, Laura and Carlos put everything else on hold to search for their son.As all of this is going on, I was amazed at how well Bayona maintains the feel of impending horror. The key to this success lies in how realistic everything appears. Laura's impending dread is almost palpable and Rueda does a great job of making her seem real. As the film progresses, the relationship between Laura and Carlos takes some natural turns and develops in a real way.But everything kicks into high gear when the medium, Aurora, played by Geraldine Chaplin, appears. Carlos is reluctant to go along with this, but because he loves his wife, he follows her lead. And Laura is willing to try anything and everything to find their son. Aurora's associates set-up elaborate recording equipment throughout the house. Then, they put her in the old children's bedroom and watch as she tries to communicate with the spirit or spirits in the house. She almost immediately makes contact and begins to walk through the house, trying to find out more about them, about what they need. As Aurora talks to these spirits, we follow her progress as Laura does, watching everything through monitors, the images captured in grainy green infrared monitors. As we follow her progress, we believe she is actually communicating with these spirits and hope she will be able to make some sort of breakthrough.Chaplin does a great job of making this character believable, scary, yet natural. Aurora believes she can communicate with the dead. Because she believes, there is no reason for her to protest when other people doubt. She knows the truth.More importantly, this sequence is all the more effective because we are watching along with Carlos and Laura, as Aurora progresses through the rooms. We don't see ghosts, or spirits materialize out of thin air, we only hear Aurora trying to communicate with them. We only hear what she says, and it is cryptic at best, but it is very effective at making the scene creepy and spine tingling.Then, Laura continues to search and when the truth is finally revealed, we feel everything she feels.I guess, long story - short (I know, too late), what I am trying to say is Guillermo Del Toro is quietly trying to revive the ghost story, the horror film, and wants us to feel the genuine scares and chills behind the characters and the stories. He is making some scary films, and he is earning our fright with intelligent, well-made efforts that just might prove more influential than the current crop of torture porn.""The Orphanage"" is very successful at creating a mood of impending horror, terror and dread, using none of the techniques we have become accustomed to in horror films. Thank goodness.",Positive
"I watched all available seasons of Being Human (the UK show) - available on Amazon Prime, by the way - and enjoyed them all.  The premise of the show is beyond credibility (ghost, vampire, and werewolf roommates), but the episodes are interesting nonetheless.  Each episode is wrapped around several storylines (typically, one for each of the primary characters) and how they intersect (or not, in some cases).  Most are resolved within the episode, but there is some carryover (i.e., hanging suspense that requires viewing the next episode).  I believe this show is still on the air.  If you watched the British series, you will see quite a lot of similarities (some duplicate storylines).  There are quite a few differences though, including storylines that do differ.  Some basic premises change - such as vampires being visible by camera - which eliminate a number of the British storylines from consideration.  Good, semi-mindless viewing.",Positive

not even sure what its about but it must be a good one maybe on prime or something ill be watching to see what hes liking,Positive
"The charm of this film is raw beauty of the place and the unpolished dialogue. Refreshing, quirky, and nicely done.",Positive
I watch it when nothing else is on. I would rate it with Michael J fox show and Crazy Ones it will make you laugh but its not amazing like The Millers or Modern Family those shows are way entertaining. The show is basically about a gay dude in his early 40's that has a daughter it shows the his relationship with his mother and co workers. Its marginally funny.,Negative
"Season 2 stepped it up!  This show is letting people know it is going to stick around!  If you liked Season 1, Season 2 will not disappoint!",Positive
"I liked the characters, all of them.  The writing was excellent regarding plot, action and dialogue.  Having an entire season at one time,  I continued through each episode, looking forward to the next.  Intriguing.",Positive
"I never saw this promoted on TV and I wish it had been more popular so there were additional seasons. It's unique and funny. It is an unusual, almost unbelievable storyline but it unfolds in such a way that - if you stay with it - you become hooked. At least I did. I want to know more about why this cop ended up in prison, what's with him and his lawyer, his partner, his exwife and just about everyone else he knew and meets up with. Damien Lewis' character is definitely a contradiction. One of the things I don't like is the repetitive interviews with people about what they think of the cop going to jail. It's seldom new, they keep playing the same stuff over and over. That is a bit annoying. But the series and the actors are great. Adam Arkin has a quirky part, very similar to the character he played on Northern Exposure and equally effective.",Positive
I really enjoyed Alpha House. I found the Senators hilarious. John Goodman makes the show &#34;ring&#34;. I'm looking forward to more episodes in the future. The John Goodman character has to be re-elected!!,Positive
"This is a wonderful and engrossing show.  While I did struggle at times to suspend my disbelief, the writing, acting and directing make this one of my all time favorites.",Positive
"Awesome cast. But this spin-off still might not have worked. I find the shift in investigative techniques works well. And the interaction between characters is more about camaraderie than friction. Others may not find this as &#34;dramatic&#34;, but I enjoy it. Wish we had had more of Tom Berenger, but I understood the storyline.",Positive
"We live in a universe of doubters, and a series remake of a beloved film , just can't be as good as the original. True, in some sense, except the series 'Fargo' is not the same as the film. We have Minnesota, the accents that we love to copy, the cold, cold, snowy weather, and I read it was filmed in Vancouver at -20 degrees at times.The first episode has Lester Nygaard, played by Martin Freeman of Watson's Sherlock fame, and he is superb, being henpecked by his wife. We meet the up and coming policewoman, Deputy Molly Solverson, played by Allison Tolman.  Bob Odenkirk from 'Breaking Bad', plays a skittish, not so smart deputy. I didn't recognize him until I read the list of characters. Colin Hanks plays a policeman who stops Malvo, hears him talk and decides to let him go, smart move. Billy Bob Thornton, plays Lorne Malvo, a pure delight as a very intelligent hit man, who seems to have insight into everyone's lives. He acts before he is asked.The atmosphere and the environment seem like 'Fargo'. The frozen breath, the crisp snow and the weird humour we expect. Not laugh out loud funny, but deep down, ah ha's! The episode moves along at a good pace, several murders before our eyes, and the one most unexpected is the best. Smart writing, excellent acting, good music, everything to love. Lester and Malvo seem to hit it off, and will they or won't they?Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-20-14",Positive
Maybe I am confused but the last episode available this season seems to be November 25th. Surely this isn't the end of the season? Anyone know what's up? Thanks!!,Positive
I ordered this episode of Justified through Amazon's video on demand service since I recently got rid of cable.  Justified is a great show and this episode proves why.  Funny one liners and lots of great action.  FX's best tv show and one of the top three on television currently and maybe top 5 of all time.,Positive
"Okay, I was in desperate need for a program to tide me over til the next season of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;. Another customer very kindly suggested this to me. So happy he did! I can't believe I've ignored this on tv for so long, I've seen it advertised but just wasn't interested. As I wrote above, my bad. Season One was excellent as is the two that follow, obviously including this one. Now I'm having withdrawals waiting for season four which I'll have to admit, I will end up paying for as I can't wait until it's free with my Prime account. That's how good I find this show to be. That should tell you something when I can wait and get this free eventually but will pay to watch it sooner instead. As a matter of fact I can't wait for June 22nd! This show has everything, scary aliens, especially those intimidating 'Mech's', family story lines, romance, plenty of action, everything one would want from this type of show. I love all of the characters and they all work well and seamlessly together. It's a &#34;must have&#34; for my tv viewing!",Positive
"This is no &#34;MURDER ONE, Season 1&#34;, but it is quite good.  If I remember my Wikipedia info, the network cancelled it after only four episodes, which is more indicative of network stupidity than of the show's quality.  I thought this was one of Rob Morrow's best works.  Regardless of the outcome of each case, guilty or not, the final minutes reveal what the &#34;Whole Truth&#34; was.  Don't be discouraged when Morrow's character loses the first three cases, since he then goes on a winning streak.",Positive
Great series. So very glad it's available via Amazon. AND commercial fee.  Well worth the &#34;rental fee&#34;.,Positive
"How to tell when a movie is below budget cheap.(1.) No subtitles for either English or people with hearing problems.(2.) Intro that makes no intelligent sense to anyone with a high school or above educational background. NASA finds alien life forms in our solar system which have been identified as ""the writer's of  this movie"". NASA decides to bring said alien life back to Earth who start out looking remarkably like common wood decay fungi (e.g. Trametes versicolor) but then acquire the anatomy of an ocean dwelling cross between a jellyfish and a squid. Unfortunately for our alien writers who never passed 10th grade biology or 9th grade physical science the physics of this anatomy is mechanically unsustainable walking about on the surface of Earth.(3.) Handheld cinematography that looks like something your Neanderthal relatives took while touring deteriorating industrial, trash and natural disaster wreckage in Central America. Really really bad/cheap CGI on our poor stranded jellysquid. The jellysquid's agent should be fired or eaten.(4.) Actors with the emotional impact of the above mentioned fungi and the dialogue capacity of seven monosyllabic words per edited scene.(5.) Props in the movie consisted mostly of road signs that said ""Infection Area""; fungi on trees; army surplus gas masks; a crane to lift a truck then drop it which is edited to make it seem like the aforementioned jellysquid did it.(6.) Whale sound effects that unfortunately for our alien writers, had they spent $10 to hire a marine biologist they would have found out, that for the most part are of a frequency pattern that works primarily under water. Which brings up the question of what planet in our solar system did these creatures come from?(7.) It takes 45 minutes into this handheld travelogue before anything interesting happens and another 45 minutes to hope it ends quicker.",Negative
I really liked this show. I think it's worth seeing a whole season. I would watch more. I hope their app catches fire and we see how they handle success.,Positive
"I think that the first episode of ""Agents of SHIELD"" is pretty good for a pilot! There are a few wrinkles and a few minor errors, but overall the premise seems good and the actors all seem pretty well cast.The show is a bit cheesy, and they do hit a few tropes a little too hard, but that's to be expected from Joss Whedon, and if you're a Buffy fan you may actually enjoy some of the schlocky stuff. In any event, it's not deal-breaking, just a bit corny here and there. I think once they smooth off some rough edges this will be a fun show!",Positive
This is a very good series based in the late '50s. I would look forward to more from Amazon on this. It's a definitely watch series.,Positive
I enjoyed these stories and Vera's wry sense of humor.  Please continue with Season two for me to enjoy soon.,Positive
they jumped the story to far from reality eliminate the things that made Bionics and reinvented it as something else and added bizzare plot twist that didn't really make sense.  If you were a big fan of the original this one may disappoint; still special effects are of course better as tech has improved but that's about it.,Negative
This is the best cop series I have ever seen. The characters as so original. The stories are are so imaginative and not derivative like so many cop shows.  I hated it when I realized I was watching the last episode.,Positive
This season was good but not as well written as previous seasons. I didn't not like the Crow family storyline. I would still recommend watching it because it will follow along into the next season. The main characters keep getting better. I would like to see Raylan Givens with his wife and daughter. They are good for each other.,Positive
It is so fun to watch the items in their completion.  I am constantly amazed though at the amount of money people will spend to get something restored.  Wow!,Positive
"Honestly here guys, overall this things getting 4 stars with an overall of 33 votes so far? Come on, who are you kidding? Every other site slams this movie with honest reviews, IMDB has this as 4 of 10 stars with 673 votes. Put two and two together here folks. You saw the trailer right? If not, go see it, and you will know this movie is going to be horrible just from watching that. Horrible acting, bad editing, dodgy sound, ugly lead actresses, dumb plot, and made by two girls no one I know has ever heard of. What where they popular on a public access show they produced in a town that all 32 residents living their watched it? So why is there reviews here praising how much they love them? Sounds to me like one of the following possibilities.1 - One or both of the twins wrote a review or two here.2 - Some pervert just heard it was female twins and went nuts obsessing over it.3 - Friends of friends of friends... you know, ""like my movie on facebook guys!!!""4 - It's just a bunch of jokers having a stupid laugh.5 - Drunk or mental conditions apply to the reviewer.6 - Watched the wrong movie.Add a 7 if you have any more thoughts :D",Negative
"I really like this series! The first season was great, the second season was only OK, but this season is AWESOME!!!",Positive
"Okay, as a fan of the original ""Grave Encounters"" - and it is one of the better entries in the increasingly-boring and overpopulated ""found footage"" genre - I decided to give this one a shot... One of the many times I wish I would actually heed my fellow reviewers' posts... I'm not going to say anything new about GE2 here because everybody just about hit the proverbial nail on the head... One poster said it best when he said that it appears that the Vicious Brothers have nothing new to bring to the table. Shame, because GE gave some credibility back to the genre. Only time will tell, I suppose...",Negative
This is by far one of the best written and most historically acurate shows I have seen in a long time. Stumbled across the first series a week ago and have spent every evening since watching it. It is interesting and pulls you in. Would recommend to anyone!,Positive
Loved first season.. loved second season. Looking forward to what they come up with for the next &#34;American Horror Story&#34;,Positive
"An o.k. season. The writing strike did this and other shows no favours. The actors were all superb, the directing and producer started to lose their way in this season.",Positive
I could not finish watching this movie. It started out good but lost its focus. All I can say is never trust anything that claim it will grant you 3 wishes. Not my kind of movie.,Negative
"but with a freaky X-Files vibe from the creator of the X-Files....  The pilot is off in many areas, but it does just enough at the end to say &#34;I want to know more&#34; and having seen all the pilots now, I think this is more deserving of a full season than Transparent or Mozart in the Jungle.  If it came down to this or Bosch though, Bosch wins hands down.This reminded me of the football pilot.  It was full of all the same cliches of a story like this, but it did just enough to be different enough that I wanted to see another episode.",Positive
"Wish we had more shows like this.  Intelligent, NO laugh track, great actors, great writing.  No mindless garble.  This is priceless!",Positive
"Heroic leaders of the Wild Bunch and The Train Robbers Syndicate &#8211; Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid were eventually hounded into South America where both died in a shoot out with the military at San Vicente in 1908. But recent excavations for their bones have revealed that neither set of remains is there. Enter Director MATEO GIL and Writer MIGUEL BAROS and their superb 2011 film &#34;Blackthorn&#34; - 'reinterpreting' the lives of those men of folklore and Wild West legends.It&#8217;s now 1927 and James Blackthorn (the older Butch Cassidy played to grizzly perfection by the hugely watchable Sam Sheppard) lives a simple life as a horse-breeder in a tiny farmstead in the Bolivian Mountains - occasionally visited by his local lover/maid Yana (great work by Magaly Solier). He writes letters to his nephew Ryan in America signed by Uncle Butch telling the lad they will soon be joined at last and live out a good life together.But on the way back from a horse trade/card game in a nearby town &#8211; a desperate Spaniard called Eduardo Apodaca robs him of $6000. The man from Madrid claims he only shot at Blackthorn&#8217;s horse because he himself is being hunted &#8211; but not for fame to prove the legend still lives &#8211; but for $50,000 hidden in a mine &#8211; the fruits of a greedy land boss who&#8217;s fleeced the locals of everything. The charming Eduardo promises he&#8217;ll pay back Blackthorn everything he&#8217;s lost &#8211; and the two outlaws form a wary and unlikely alliance out of necessity as they try to evade a posse of 12 Chilean horsemen who know the terrain and seem relentless in their pursuit.Cleverly flashing back to the younger Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid between 1900 and 1908 - what happened to them and their feisty lady in tow Etta Place - slowly begins to unfold. The young Butch and Sundance are played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Games Of Thrones) and Padraic Delaney with Etta portrayed by the exquisitely beautiful Dominique McElligott (the camera adores this woman &#8211; the stunning looks of Olivia Wilde meets the playfulness of Taylor Schilling).  Thrown into this heady mix is Stephen Rea as Irishman MacKinley who once had the famous duo in his custodial grasp only to be made a fool of for the rest of his life (fabulous work by Rea as the older drunk and embittered version). And on it goes to a gun-battle with desperados in the scorching white arid expanse of the Salt Flats where Eduardo may not have been entirely honest with Blackthorn&#8230;Handsome male and female leads in Frontier garb, horses galloping across grassy plains, campfires in the moonlight, water dripping onto gravel mountain paths, dirty faces in dusty shacks, women wearing Pollera pleated-skirts, Manta woollen shawls and round bowlers hats while they holster guns in rot-gut Chicha bars along railway tracks&#8230; As you can imagine &#34;Blackthorn&#34; is a looker on BLU RAY. Defaulted to 16 x 9 &#8211; it also fills the full screen beautifully - grittily realistic and as the Spaniard says looking out over canyons - &#34;Sometimes it's beautiful&#8230;&#34; Audio is 5.1 English DTS-HD, there are no subtitles and disappointingly there are no extras either.Rewatching it on BLU RAY for a second time &#34;Blackthorn&#34; proves a far more rewarding Western fix than I'd first thought and in some ways is better than the more vaunted &#34;True Grit&#34;. Mount up your mule, fix your rimmed hat, stick a cigar in your mouth, scratch your whiskers, get your ukulele out and start singing &#34;Damn your eyes&#8230;&#34; out loud all the way home to your ye-ha ranch.Hell - you know you want to 'pardner'&#8230;",Positive
I love cooking competition shows.  But this one gets on my nerves with the (really bad) &#34;jokes&#34; and with the Chairman's antics....really didn't like it.  Obviously a lot of folks disagree with me as it is now in its 8th season.  Just wasn't my taste.,Negative
"I'm not into reality shows. In fact, this is the only reality show I watch.  I heard something in the news about a remark 'Phil' made and I was wondering why all the hub-bub over this Phil's remark. Anyway, I find the show very entertaining.  You would never know these people are millionaires by their lifestyles.  They are true rednecks and proud of it.  I find the show amusing and fascinating.  They eat things like frogs and roadkill.  The wives are attractive, the men have unkempt beards, but their speech is very articulate. I get a chance to watch about 3 episodes a week. I'm almost done with Season 1 and ready to continue to the next Season.",Positive
Call me a Sci Fi nut. I like this show and I enjoy being able to take it with me where I go.,Positive
"If The Hurt Locker, starring J. Remmer, had come out just a couple of weeks earlier, this series probably would been continued.  But, he's probably become too famous and in demand now to do a TV series again.  Too bad, I would have looked forward to another season of this show.  Very enjoyable with a great cast.",Positive
"Talk about dysfuncion! The realism was fantastic. Very strong characters. Endless possibilities. I'd love to see what you could do with an entire seasons worth of shows. Well written, and superbly acted. Bring it on!",Positive
"I've been kind of burned out on reality TV for some time now but this one brought me back!  The basis of the show is an experiment to re-create the early 1900's Estate type of living that the English are so well known for.  Each person selected is assigned a role that they must play, and all the participants have agreed to strict adherence to the rules of that time.  Hence second parlor maids are not even permitted to speak to the family.  It really has an upstairs, downstairs kind of quality to it in that there are very strict social rules to be followed.  They go through scullery maids like you would not believe in this series, and the drama that existed at the start of the 20th century really comes through in this series.  I loved it!  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in this time period.  It would also be excellent for any student who loves history and wants to see it in action.",Positive
This movie was horrible. If you are a fan of horror films skip it brcause you are noy missing much.,Negative
Love the history of the way things used to be.  Acting is terrific.  Characters are brought to life through history. Can't wait for series 3,Positive
"This was unlike any other &#34;space&#34; drama show, past or present.  It was a dramatic show that just happened to be set in space. All 4 seasons were awesome (I've watched the series from &#34;end to end&#34; many times and I never tire of it).  Whether you like sci-fi or not, it's worth every penny.",Positive
"Good writing, good production value, engaging subplots, and impressive acting. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes crime drama or scifi",Positive
"You would think with all the big names that we would have and acting, directing, story writing tour de force. Wrong!! Disappointed to say it was the same old spirit storyline with just a few corny same old ghost special effects. Acting was as robotic as the effects were corny. After two weeks there is little to remember and in two more weeks nothing will be remembered. Sad day for Fanning (or good if you like money).",Negative
"I've only seen one episode of ""Destination Truth"", the one ominously called ""Alien Invaders/Swedish Lake Monster"". I admit I laughed quite a lot, sometimes with Josh and his team, sometimes at them (or rather at the concept). But sure, this should get higher ratings than the incredibly boring ""Monsterquest"" over at History Channel.After a positively bizarre visit to the ex-Soviet republic of Kazakhstan (complete with Cold War kitsch and sputniks falling from the sky), Josh Gates and his indefatigable investigators make a landfall in Sweden - of all places. Somehow, paranormal phenomena isn't something you would normally associate with the land of The Welfare State and the Polkagris!But yes, folks, Sweden has its very own version of the Loch Ness monster, called Storsj&ouml;odjuret (try pronounce that). It supposedly lives, breathes or perhaps snorkels in the cold waters of Storsj&ouml;n, a lake outside the Swedish town of &Ouml;stersund in the county of J&auml;mtland.For decades, the monster was protected by law, but in 2005 the local authorities were forced to rescind the protection, since higher authorities found it to be ""frivolous"" - after all, there *is* no Great Lake Monster, and you can't legally protect a species that doesn't exist. Ah, the Swedish red tape, don't you just love it! According to urban legend, the decision to protect the monster was taken by the county office at April Fool's Day, but I haven't been able to confirm this.Frankly, I didn't know people in J&auml;mtland took their little monstrosity so damn seriously. Josh isn't kidding - there are cameras rigged all around the lake, to catch the monster on tape if it ever shows up above the waterline, a project financed by both the Swedish government (or rather by an obscure outfit of the vast Swedish government bureaucracy) and the European Union. So *that's* alright, but legal protection's a no-no?!I think Storsie, as English-speaking forteans call the monster, and ""Destination Truth"" go together very well, LOL. This show could be described as MacGyver meeting the Blair Witch, complete with team members screaming ""OH MY GOD, WHAT IS THAT?"" and constant cliff hangers (and commercial breaks) keeping the viewers on the edge...well, sort of. Josh & The Team certainly made an impression - they are still mentioned at the official website of Storsj&ouml;odjuret, where Josh is affectionately referred to as ""The Boss"".OK, let me guess, this show is...well, scripted?!That being said, I still feel a bit too old for this concept, but I'm sure the little people around 12 years of age will love every minute of it. As a crazy local patriot, I naturally have to give the episode five stars. But, as all monster shows, even ""Destination Truth"" ends inconclusively. After all, the Great Lake Monster might simply be...a pike.They are not protected by law.",Positive
This is a great show for kids and adults. I hope this becomes the longest made tv show. My kids have an awsome time watching,Positive
I really like this show.  I am not learning anything new here but just like to see what these people are up to.  Some of them seem to be a little extreme - hence doomsday - but it is fun to watch.  If you like anything about prepping or even if you dont you will like this stuff.  Some of it does leave you scratching your head going really?  The stories follow people that are prepping for an extinction level event and what they are doing to prepare for it if you are at all curious.,Positive
These writers deserve kudos for keeping it exciting and moving forward.  Most series that start off great get stuck in a rut with hit-n-miss episodes.  So far; they've kept it in the &#34;great&#34; category.With the uptick in Russian-American tensions; this topic takes on a new air of reality.I'm sad that there are only 2 episodes left to the season.  I guess that's better than Mad Men or Under The Dome that split their latest seasons into 2 years.,Positive
This is a wonderful period series based on true stories.  The cast is wonderful.  The writing is A1 and I would recommend to anyone who loves period pieces.,Positive
"I love this show. It's really enjoyable to sit and watch. I love all the characters, especially Regina. I hope ABC continues with this  show.",Positive
"This was a nice idea for a short film. Its a strange parody of a horror film complete with breaking the fourth wall. Its really about breaking the rules of story and film in general. A tire comes to life out in the desert, comes to town and kills a bunch of people. The acting is generally good. The ""bits"" as written are well done. But the whole thing is way, way padded out. The idea just doesn't have enough in it to carry the whole film alone. And the filler between the good bits gets real boring fast.They either needed to cut it down to 20 minutes or add something major to the story. The laughs just don't come fast enough and the good bits they do are quite obviously spread far apart. Some people will like it in its current length. Its arty and cute at 80 minutes. But those outside the European art house crowd are going to notice how the story drags really quick. And putting space between absurdist gags tends to undermine them.Quentin Dupieux displays considerable talent in doing short films. He previous did the French film ""steak"" which was similarly absurdist. But he needs to get beyond writing a series of bits and gags. He needs to learn how to pace out a full length film and how to put together a long form story. Or else he should stick to shorter films.Its not perfect. But its creative, well crafted with good writing and good acting. In spite of its flaws, its absolutely worth seeing. Though best viewed with the fast forward button ready to go at all times.",Negative
I recently watched this with my wife who had started watching gold rush on season 2.  I had originally skipped it thinking it would be boring watching it again.  Boy was I wrong.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and seeing how the different miners of season 2 and beyond joined the crew.  It was great seeing Parker as a young quiet kid.  Totally worth the rewatch.,Positive
"Although it was short lived on the series lineups, it had a good cast and script of action, suspense, and science-fiction to keep all those who attempt to make science work in science fiction, busy watching. Aliens and populated Earth bound ascentient beings existing over time has many philosophical brain teasers questioning whether we are alone or if your neighbor, loved-one, or friend are bit more than you think.  It's a great re-watch of Science Fiction made into a series that does not or should not bend your mind too much. Enjoy.",Positive
"The writing and story line are realistic and intelligent.  The actors are convincing.  I am intrigued by the value presentations in a legal aid and a corporate office.  These presentations show legal aid being caring and strict, and also portrays corporate defense with heart as well as profit.",Positive
"I love police procedurals. My favorite is the Swedish Wallander, so that's the standard I compare others against, and Single-Handed does a great job of entertaining me and making me want to see more. The acting is superb, so much so that you can forget they are actors and believe in these complicated people, their small town on the western edge of Ireland, and the tough lives they lead. I enjoyed every minute.",Positive
"Poirot & David Suchet ... does it get any better.  The scenes are rich in the decor of the time, which adds to the enjoyment.",Positive
loved it!,Positive
Parts of you  want the gator to get free and get away.  Yet it is cool to see such a massive creature over taken by a person less than a quarter its weight.,Positive
Looking forward to watching the 2nd season and see what happens next.  Keep up the good work you are a wonderful cast.,Positive
Not badly acted. Script and tension building work . I love the ever pervading atmosphere of an ancient labaryntine New York  apartment complex. One huge apartment anonymous and lost but strangely still in the consciouness of wierd or irate neighbours is very creepy although a faithful attentive doorman presides.The tenant has been advised to squat the apartment in order to uphold a very cheap rental agreement from grand-mother until it goes to court. Meanwhile tenant is mysteriously intimidated.Now this is supposed to be film probably on the paranormal. But ruined by a soon apparent wacking great hole in the back of a wall with a large space going up and down the side of the building....yes  a miscief-maker hired by a determined landlord could well be entering the apartment  which kills off the spooky side of the film.Secondly if the tenant can get the doorman to hire and let in an exterminator then he sure can let in a builder to cover said wacking great hole. There other hole is in the cognitive frontal lobe of the producer to miss this.,Negative
I wasn't sure I would like this program but it is Stephen Kings best work.  It has such a variety of odd stories that you can't wait to watch the next.  I never get tired of watching them over and over because of such unique tales,Positive
"I was a little skeptical about The Legend of Korra, but as a fan of the first, I couldn't resist to watch.  I initially thought it started slowly, but perhaps that was with my skeptical eyes wanting it to not be as good as Team Ang.  Nonetheless, I was hooked and, more importantly, impressed.  The writers/creators have somehow managed to use the same charm as the first one -- through its excellent writing, humor, and nice animation (even better).  I also feel it's a little more grown-up, which is great because it recognizes that its original fan base has also grown up, making it very relevant.  The last few episodes were epic.  I need to re-watch the last one ... right now!",Positive
Bryan Cranston delivers an ending worthy of an Oscar if this was a movie lol. The ending was just amazing well written great acted well executed a must see.,Positive
I love the intrigue of this season and happy that Annie and Auggie is together ! I love this show!,Positive
I really enjoyed the entire series of Ballykissangel. I was sad to see it end. Entertaining and funny with a little drama thrown in for good measure,Positive
"Thought the movie would be boring, but it turned out just the opposite. This was one of the most informative movies I have ever watched. It's a must see.",Positive
The story lines are fast moving and exciting.  Sometimes it seems a bit convoluted but the twists in the plot resolve and things work out in the end.,Positive
"This (5th) season has, several times, had me holding my breath or pausing an episode from the tension it builds! Wow! This is one of the few series that just gets better and better each year. My favorite (in this genre) series used to be Breaking Bad, but SOA has moved to position one.",Positive
"Acting and dialog surpasses what one suspect from a barebones independent flick. In fact the screenwriter exceeds his/her more generously funded studio-supported colleagues in realistic character exchanges. Standard story, but well executed.",Positive
"I am not a big documentary film fan, but I took a change on Craigslist Joe and boy am I glad I did.  By far one of the more inspiring, honest and emotional movies I have ever seen.  It was shot during the 2008 economic crisis and it uncovered how truly good people are...it was amazing to see and I would recommend that everyone add this to their must watch movie rental list!",Positive
1. I love TK's new awareness.2. I would have loved to see Nico and Dani get together. Sad Nico is leaving,Positive
Watch this show every week and become part of the Rizzoli and Isle family.  They are interesting intelligent and charming. The stories are  well written.  It's all I'm looking for.,Positive
"I loved the concept and the storyline of this series. Although it is Borderline repetitive, it is a good series non the less.",Positive
I know I am going to enjoy every minute. I can't believe it will be gone next year. I look forward every week to the next episode. So well written and such good actors. I have to have my Mad Men every week. Someday I many watch the whole thing all over again.,Positive
"This is not a well written show. It's unoriginal, the characters are bland, and it's not funny. It's not the worst of the pilots but it's near the bottom.",Negative
That pretty much sums up what I have to say.  These are probably the only two actors I would fly anywhere to watch if I had the money AND THEY ARE BOTH IN THE SAME SHOW.  The entire cast is wonderful.  The Hour is a series that you MUST watch. Even though it ends after only two seasons. :(With all the forgettable crap that is on TV nowadays I'm of the belief that cancelling such a triumph of Television such as this will be looked back on as a great crime to the arts and humanity.  These producers who cancelled it will have God to answer to when they die for committing this crime.- I'm serious. :(,Positive
"The cast and the previews looked worth watching...I watched episode 1 and within the first sequence I knew what was going to happen and I knew who was the &#34;bad guy&#34;. Dermot Mulroney, who plays the bad guy, looks terrible... dirty and dingy and not-watchable.The premise is stupid. I am to believe that a group of teenagers whose parents are the most powerful and influential in the country (including the president's son), ALL are on a bus... a &#34;normal&#34; field trip... WITH only two secret service vehicles following them and no other security to be found... AND no security ON the bus... AND a crazy ex-FBI (or other 3-letter word agent) is on the bus with them. Seriously! First, isn't a secret service agent to be WITH the president's kid at ALL times, WITH him, by his side, ON the bus? Second, none of these other high-powered people have security around their kids at all... and third, a field trip, a freaking field trip. Where the hell where they going? What field trip with 16-17 year olds? WHERE ARE THEY GOING?And... a secret service agent is suppose to lay down his life for the president and his family. They are NOT to be compromised. But oh... wait... if I buy into this premise, of course they are easily compromised.That premise within itself made me roll my eyes. Then it gets better... &#34;send the other vehicle ahead to secure the restaurant for lunch&#34; yeah, the one other secret service vehicle... WHAT?... oh, but wait.. it gets better... the other vehicle disappears then there is a road block... AND... let's get out of our vehicles and NOT secure the president's son and just see what's going on... WHAT?All of that in the first 15 minutes... I'm suppose to buy that... but oh...I find out that the show is going to be centered around a bunch of teenagers... ummm... no.Gillian Anderson, bless her heart... she looks good but that's about it. No emotion... none! And she did have a line for that something about... &#34;I'm not going to be this way for long&#34;... WHAT?oh... but wait... the bad guy, is of course, the BEST at what he does... which I guess is controlling everything thru his computer setup... and the FBI (or some other 3-letter agency) just fired him for something that he, of course, did not do, and let him go on his merry way.One positive note: The storyline with the new-to-the-job secret service agent was pretty good. IF I watched the show again it would be to see how he saves the day, which is where it is seemingly headed. I was engaged with this part. I wanted to see what he would do to save the boy and himself.I didn't care about the rest of the story. I just wanted it to be over. However, the series could be saved. If I was writing it, I would get the teenagers rescued in the second episode so that little teen drama is over. Kill the supposed bad guy and find that he was actually working for someone else so there are is a &#34;real&#34; bad guy. And have a storyline in there of how the secret service and the FBI screwed up. But the remainder of the show would be the FBI against this new bad guy and of course, saving the day.Anyway, this is bad. I could probably pick apart every scene. The suspense is forced. The story itself should produce the suspense. Suspense is not just drawing out a situation, making us wait wait wait for an outcome that we know is coming.At the end of the episode the bottom line seemed to be... what would you do to protect your child?... Well, it didn't seem that any of those high-powered parents did very much to protect their child by putting them on a bus for a field trip with no protection. So I guess the answer is... not so much... along with my rating.",Negative
"This show puts a spin on the everyday living in Portland, Oregon.  If you live in the Portland area, you will get a kick out of seeing things that &#34;happened&#34; in your own back yard.  If you like fairy tales, you will find this interesting.  As most fairy tales do not have a happy ending, neither do these stories.",Positive
"The land is beautiful at Porcupine Creek.  The guys get to setting up their equipment and planning their operations.  John Schnabel, a 91-yr old successful miner, bring a lot of gold nuggets and gives tips on fining gold.Jack just can't wait to get to the gold, and as he operates their excavator, he actually dents his truck - yikes!The group has a lot of worries as bears lurk around their camp.  Jimmy Dorsey was in a particularly difficult situation as he lacked a secure place to sleep.  You've got to worry about bears at Porcupine Creek.This episode showed the extreme eagerness of the men to get started and the fact that they were not nearly so well prepared as all had hoped.",Positive
"I enjoyed LAY THE FAVORITE, but I&#8217;m not quite sure how to classify it.The film&#8217;s distributor is attempting to promote it as a &#8220;comedy,&#8221; but it isn&#8217;t one.  Nor is it a &#8220;drama&#8221;.So, what is it?For lack of a better term, I&#8217;ll call it an interesting &#8220;light drama&#8221; about the world of gambling.Adapted from the best-selling memoir by Beth Raymer, the story centers on &#8220;Beth&#8221; (Rebecca Hall), a former Florida stripper who travels with her dog to Las Vegas and winds up working for &#8220;Dink&#8221; (Bruce Willis), the owner of a small-time sports gambling enterprise.Beth and Dink soon discover that she is good with numbers, and the business begins to thrive until Dink&#8217;s jealous wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) arrives on the scene, forcing the younger woman to quit Vegas and travel to New York with her new boy friend (Joshua Jackson) and go to work for a shady gambler (Vince Vaughn).  Unfortunately, in New York, gambling is illegal, and before long, Beth must call on Dink to help her out of a sticky situation that can land her in prison for a long stretch.Stephen Frears directed this entertaining film.The Blu-Ray release from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes several deleted scenes. Michael B. Druxman",Negative
"Wonderful story line from Masterpiece Theater, there's always 2 or 3 situations going on throughout all episodes. The scenery is as Hastings was and what look like original aircraft being used from WW2 very authentic  with all the old cars etc. Wonderful characters played by good sound english actors. Great watching",Positive
"The characters led the story along with purpose, suspense and intrigue.  It has the flavor of the USA show 60 Minutes in many ways.  For instance the title for openers.  I thought the ending was just a little too weak but hopefully if there is a second season I am looking forward to that. I watched this show with interest.",Positive
"V/H/S is a weird and strangely fascinating film that takes the found footage genre and raises it up a notch, as it's basically a found footage movie built upon a number of different found footage videos, with everything tied together with a twisted little bow.  For the first 15-20 minutes, you're a little unsure about what you're watching; by the end of the first little sub-story, though, you know you're in for an uncommonly wild ride through a gauntlet of dark and gory horror thrills.  Those who give up on V/H/S too early don't know what they're missing.The main storyline has us tagging along with a bunch of twenty-something hooligans who go around filming all of their acts of vandalism, robbery, assault, and other nefarious deeds.  Then one of them says he has a job that promises a most satisfactory payoff.  All they have to do is break into this old man's house and steal a certain video tape - they have no idea what is on the tape, but the third party that wants it says they'll know it when they see it.  So off they go, video camera in hand, to burgle the old guy's house.  The job seemingly gets a lot easier when they find the old man dead in his chair, facing a wall of TV monitors and video players.  That gives them the chance to go through the video tapes they do find to try and find ""the tape.""  As it turns out, though, that's where they make their big mistake.This is when things start to get good.  Each tape features a group of strangers filming their own little adventures.  The first one, for example, features three guys who go out on the town to pick up chicks - with one of the guys wearing spy glasses to capture all the fun on video.  They manage to get a couple of girls to go home with them, but things don't go as planned from that point on.  One of the girls is really weird - both in terms of her looks and her behavior - and she is definitely not the type you want to bring home, even for a one night stand.  Then you have a travelogue of a couple's vacation out west, with some creepy moments leading up to an unexpected ending; a group of college kids' trip to an isolated lake (and you know nothing good ever comes from that scenario); a string of video chat recordings between a cute girl and her out-of town boyfriend, centering on a ""haunting"" in the girl's apartment; and, finally, a group of buddies' video of the Halloween party from hell (a word to the wise: when you go to a Halloween party, make sure you've got the right house before you go in).  Of course, in between and after each video, our gang of hooligans are unknowingly filming their own horror story for us, as well.V/H/S really offers a great new spin on the found footage genre.  The middle stories aren't as strong as the first and last ones, but there are some really good special effects throughout.  Everything is filmed on VHS tape, of course, some of them copied on top of other recordings, so we aren't talking about digital special effects here.  That being said, some of the effects are really just superb given the VHS format.  Blood, gore, and ghostly manifestations all look cheaply real rather than really cheap.  You're a little hard pressed to find any characters you like in any of these stories, but that doesn't really matter in this particular context.  The first and last videos are particularly spellbinding, while all of them have their creepy moments.  I think most horror fans, even those who dislike found footage films, will get a real kick out of V/H/S.",Positive
"This is a smidge above-average as far as the TV-rendering of true ghost sightings go.  Every so often, you will hear an EVP or see a picture that can actually be deemed credible.  Chill, unease, and creepiness can be experienced in this series, but erroneous conclusions (unrequited love, tragic-death apparitions, spirits looking for the Light) are often unjustifiably forthcoming, which makes many of the stories seem forced.  This series, as most in the genre, seems unwilling to focus on the malevolent and gratuitous hate behind most, if not all, manifestations and opts out for the charming and quaint explanations behind a haunting. Sometimes &#34;Aunt Rita&#34; is just not your Aunt Rita.  All this said, it's still a fun and safe way to spend the better part of an hour exploring what goes bump in the night.  Worth the watch.",Positive
"This is one of the best series I've seen in years: sharp, intelligent, and great characters.  I hope it keeps coming back.",Positive
"I think most people realize that when going into feel-good sports movies, particularly when they&#8217;re produced by Disney, they shouldn&#8217;t expect a masterpiece. The majority of these kinds of films rely on true stories and are designed to pull at your heartstrings, and usually they succeed in doing so. But from my point of view they have become a bit lackluster recently, constantly being churned out as a quick moneymaker. We used to see great flicks like &#8220;The Mighty Ducks&#8221; and &#8220;Remember the Titans&#8221; every few years but these kind of movies now come few and far between. And though Disney&#8217;s newest movie &#8220;Million Dollar Arm&#8221; certainly isn&#8217;t a substitute for those, its characters and lively tone elevate the otherwise dull story.Set in 2008, the film follows J.B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm), a down-on-his-luck sports agent who will soon be run out of business if he doesn&#8217;t close the next big deal. Inspired by his best friend, he gets the brave idea to find and train Indian cricket players to become pro baseball athletes in America. Setting up a competition throughout India called Million Dollar Arm, we see his journey and eventual struggle to complete what he started.A bit generic at times and not without its flaws, the movie stumbles along the way. The pace is a tad too slow (not to mention the two hour runtime) and it takes a little while to warm up to the characters. But by the end, I&#8217;ll admit I was extremely invested in the story and was having fun. Rated PG for mild language, &#8220;Million Dollar Arm&#8221; is light-hearted and entertaining.",Positive
"Love a good ghost story, wonder about some of the truth to them.  Know about ghosts or spirits and love hearing from other folks who have had experience with them too.  There is another side we do not conciously see.  Being a therapist, wonder about the mental and emotional state of some of these story tellers.  Could it be that thier emotional state lets them be more open to seeing?",Positive

A powerfully moving drama, enjoyable from start to finish. Highly Recommended!",Positive
"The standard fare of gratuitous bloody, undead violence is served up in abundance this season. With each season a new, increasing threat to survival is introduced. First, it was walkers. Then it was the elements and group dynamic breakdown, plus blood spurting random chomping on of beloved characters. Now, the living and the dead are menacing.I refuse to give a spoiler but I will say this: don't fall in love with anyone. Your heart will be broken.",Positive
I was surprised.  Ready for more.The costumes and scenery are seem very authentic.I am glad Amazon is creating the series.,Positive
Another fine episode in this hit shows second season.  The show remains a outstanding horror fest with strong characters and good effects. This episode features another good story line about the vesson and their various actions. I haven't seen a bad episode yet of this one and this has beat the odds because most horror shows fail on tv.,Positive
"I got to admit, I didn't love the film which this is based on. But after hearing great reviews online I thought I would watch it. Fargo is one of the best shows to air on TV during to 2013-2014 TV season. The writing, directing, and acting (especially Martin Freeman who I hope goes home with an Emmy for Best Lead Actor in A Mini-Series/Movie) is great. I really recommend this show",Positive
"Movies about criminals have fascinated movie goers for decades. Consider the typical heist films of the past like THE ASPHALT JUNGLE (1950), TOPKAPI (1964) and both versions of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (1968 & 1999). All were heist films that had you rooting for the criminals to get away. It was the story and performances that made them interesting, showing how these thieves would go about stealing whatever precious object they had set as their goals. Now comes THE ART OF THE STEAL, a new heist film that starts off meek and ends with a flourish.Kurt Russell is Crunch Calhoun, a driver for a crew of art thieves who starts the film being sent to prison in Poland after a job goes south. He should have been free but his brother Nicky (Matt Dillon) sold him out to the cops so he could skate free. After 5 and a half years (time off for good behavior), Crunch is out of prison and has gone straight. He now jumps cars on his motorcycle, occasionally taking a fall for a set fee. Living with Crunch are his wife Lola (Kathryn Winnick) and his sidekick Francie (Jay Baruchel).A phone call has Crunch back in touch with his old crew led by Nicky. The old contractor in their crew has been informed by a collector that there is an item to be stolen that he will pay top dollar for. Rather than a piece of art like they've stolen in the past, this is a rare book printed by Gutenberg right after he printed the Bible. The Book of James is a piece that exists but has been stolen and replaced by a forgery. Unfortunately the thief transporting the book was caught and arrested and the book impounded by the border patrol at Niagara Falls. All they have to do is steal it within 3 days from the impound, a well monitored, well guarded facility.Crunch comes up with a plan that might work but Nicky finds flaws in it. Instead he comes up with a different plan that will incorporate some of Crunch's ideas instead. The team sets about putting the plan into motion which involves a hilarious piece of art that has to be seen to be believed. Once they piece is taken things should progress to an exchange for cash and the movie end, right? Not this time.All of this takes place in the first half of the film. What happens from their turns the heist into something else altogether different. Sure, their will be an exchange and money to be made. But is this heist the last one of the film? Or is something else going on here?The movie opens nicely, setting the stage for the heist that follows. It also puts into play a number of things that will tie into it all including a goofy Interpol agent who uses an art thief arrested in the past to help him, played by Terence Stamp. As the film progresses it offers a nice combination of suspense and humor that works well for all involved. There is no character that doesn't have their chance to shine in the limelight here. Each brings to their part nuances that make them their own. I've always thought Russell was an overlooked marvel in his films and this proves that he still has what it takes. I stated in another review that Matt Dillon has become a better actor than anyone could have imagined years ago. The rest all turn in performances that match these two and make it a definite ensemble piece.As the film progresses from the start though it feels like it might not be the best thing since sliced bread. But by the last reel you'll discover that it is one of the best heist films ever made. It brings something new to the table that differentiates it from the rest. And best of all it entertains from start to finish.Thirty minutes in I thought it was a good movie that I probably wouldn't want to keep and watch again. By the end of the film I had changed my mind. It was that good. So if you're willing to take a gamble on a crime film, then make sure you give this one a watch. I'm guessing it will be on your list of movies to recommend as well as it is on mine.",Positive

"Not even worth while renting.  All the reviews seem to be written by those who have some vested interest in the film.  A lot of cheap movie shots of Mexico somewhere and homes still not repaired from Hurricane Katrina event.  Standard boy meets girl who is already engaged but ends up not wanting to getting married to her husband to be, but falls in love with the guy she has the adventure with.  Like the last Titanic movie disaster.  I waste a lot of time watching movies, and this was very much of a waste of time.  The final seen of the monsters is some kind of land walking Octopus types with a lot of extra arms, which could not exist on land.  The Octopus type body is made only for a water environment and could not move on land.  And these monsters were not all that distinct.  The monsters do a lot of guttural and screeching sounds.  Very stupid.  At the end you have the two main actors staring at these monsters with mouth open wonderment.",Negative
"I was really excited for this one.  I love stop motion animation. I love high-concept comedies. I loved the opening explanation of the two different animation styles in this pilot, but I didn't like anything about this actual show.  I'm not surprised the writers are actors from Big Bang Theory; the show has a similar feel, but I hate that show.  It feels like they are trying so hard to make funny jokes, but very,very little is funny and some of it isn't even really jokes.  I'd have a hard time sitting through another episode of this.",Negative
"Don't you know they try to introduce something of a twist so the writers can keep their jobs? I know it's a paradox, but, what the heck. How many ways do they want to twist Alec in one season? Let's introduce a brother for Alec out of nowhere. That should work. Yeah, right.",Negative
"I was able to see this film in my home as part of a sneak peak preview this month. Luckily I was able to see the original first as if I had watched this disappointing sequel first, I may never have bothered to watch the vastly superior original. The film is bogged down with a tedious plot that only slows the action down. The stunts are still impressive, but it just doesn't deliver like the original film. Too bad! :-(",Negative
"I find Anthony Bourdain one of the first (if not main pioneers) of highlighting different foods and places where to try them.  I think it's a good show (while opinioned, it's his show and I don't think his opinions detract from the main theme) that highlights the many different cuisines of different cultures.  It's a good show to start watching if you're interested in other types of food than what you eat and see daily in your current lifestyle.  While he might dabble in other topics of the area he's in (politics, culture, etc.) he's pretty good about staying on point about food.  Highly recommended.",Positive
"Set in the 80s when there was still a KGB, this show chronicles Russian agents posing as suburban Americans in the D.C. area.  But the best aspects of this drama are the performances by Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell as the undercover Russians.  More than just believable.  Combine that with compelling stories which are about more than just completing missions, and you've got a recipe for a great series.  Put your expectations aside, you will be bowled over by where these stories go and how the characters become increasingly watchable.",Positive

"The first season was quite good, but the second season is a downward spiral which just rehashes much of the material from the 1st season. Honestly, I didn't quite make it all the way the 2nd season (two shows short). Too many of the same people, too much of the same low budget graphics, too little new material. Frankly I'm surprised that this show could possibly survive beyond a third season; yet, surprisingly it's made it all the way to season 5. The personalities interviewed are bubbling over with personality, but the logic of their arguments often lacks... Logic. An O.k. show for one or two episodes, but I totally lost interest after season two.",Negative
I thought I would enjoy this show because I am a huge Claire Danes fan.  I didn't know I would be thinking of it between shows and hardly able to wait for the next episode!

Good Eats and Man Vs Food (to name a couple of the shows that I reviewed and have now been pulled).  But I digress.  This is a GREAT SHOW!  I love it!  it's very educational, they have some science worked in to the show, along with reviews of kitchen utensils and food.  My whole family loves to watch it.

Good entertainment I enjoy a good laugh once in a while and this show gives me a few chuckles love the working dogs they are the stars of the show.,Positive
"I was interested in this show because of the material presented in the book ""Blink"", in which microexpressions are used very successfully. However, one should be careful about trying to apply what you see in this show. For example, the episode where a character is focused on because he is unconsciously or subconsciously giving someone the ""finger,"" can lead to all kinds of amateur misapplication, especially for people who do not use that gesture. It's pop science, emphasis on the pop, so just take it with a grain of salt.Also, photos of many celebrities and especially politicians are shown with a certain gesture or expression and described authoratitively as meaning or feeling this or that. This seems to speak more to the writers' prejudices and biases rather than actual facts. So, again, a word of caution. Reading microexpressions is a science which requires years of training and study; do not go off on your friends and coworkers for supposedly lying to you based on what you've seen here.So, all good fun, if you're not overly gullible.",Negative

"All one need look at is the prevalence of Oprah Winfrey evolving into her own network (OWN, indeed!) to realize that women&#8217;s issue matter in the burgeoning world of pop culture.  And I say that as a man!  Women have their own unique struggles, they have their own unique baggage, much of which gets passed down from generation to generation.  They cross that threshold from childhood to adulthood.  They bear children.  They send their boys and girls off to fight wars.  They experience their own hateful form of peer pressure from girl-to-girl that probably gives them nightmares on up in through menopause.Despite the fact that commercial advertising has told you that you&#8217;ve come a long way, baby, maybe we as a society haven&#8217;t gone far enough?  That&#8217;s some of what&#8217;s in the heart of SAVING GRACE B. JONES, a period piece tearjerker brought to you by living legend, Connie Stevens.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)For nearly 20 years, Grace (played by the incomparable Tatum O&#8217;Neal) has resided in the care of a state asylum for the insane.  Her brother, Landy (the reliable Michael Biehn), finally secures her release, and he&#8217;s bound and determined to bring her home to live with his wife, Bea (Penelope Ann Miller) and child.  However, secrets never die in Small Town America, and while the townfolks are more involved with stopping the mounting flood waters Grace won&#8217;t hold back her own dire emotions in this tale laced with jilted love and misplaced affection.The good?  I love seeing Michael Biehn in practically anything, and his turn as the small-town baker here is pretty solid.  (Granted, he&#8217;ll never quite look the part, but he does what he&#8217;s paid to do!)  Also, I could sit and watch Penelope Ann Miller read the label of a mayonnaise jar because I&#8217;m that interested in watching her work.  Lastly, there&#8217;s a great roundtable of young actresses in this that are clearly destined to have some very good careers.  Writer/director Connie Stevens has put together a winning ensemble around Tatum O&#8217;Neal that looks and sounds pretty spiffy.The bad?  Well, it just wasn&#8217;t all that interesting.  Maybe that says more about me as a viewer and a critic than it does the film, but, for all of the posturing, whining, and moaning in this Peyton Place kinda/sorta wannabe, I just didn&#8217;t feel all that motivated.  Inspired.  Or interested.Now, that may speak to Connie Stevens&#8217; weaknesses as a storyteller.  In a career that spanning nearly seven decades (you read that right), she&#8217;s best known as a luscious blonde with terrific comic timing.  FYI: this is only her second screenplay, and it&#8217;s based on a true story.  I tend to think that something was lost in the adaptation process that maybe a more learned, more experienced scriptwriter could&#8217;ve positively affected &#8211; namely, emotional journeys that resonate for all of the characters and not so few.  Of course, I&#8217;m not questioning the relevance of the subject matter, as even today societies around the world continue to struggle with how to confront mental illness.  By this film&#8217;s tragic conclusion, I thought I was losing my mind trying to keep it all together.As much as I wanted to enjoy GRACE, in the end I thought it was a bit of a narrative mess, not unlike Grace&#8217;s own fragile mind.  Not enough of it made perfect sense, but I couldn&#8217;t force myself to look away, even when I tried.  Exceptional performances across the board just weren&#8217;t enough to make this world come alive the way it should.SAVING GRACE B. JONES (2009) is produced by Shane Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled by Arc Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications?  This is one smartly shot period drama (1940&#8217;s/1950&#8217;s), and it works very well from start to finish though there was one sequence wherein it was blatantly obvious actor Scott Wilson&#8217;s dialogue was dubbed in post-production.  Lastly, I&#8217;d be remiss in my duties if I failed to point out that the film and actresses were highly decorated as part of the 2012 New York City International Film Festival, and the feature won &#8216;Best Dramatic Feature&#8217; at the 2011 Los Angeles Women&#8217;s International Film Festival.  Kudos to all involved.  Unfortunately, the disc offers no special features to speak of.INTERESTING but it&#8217;s honestly still HARD TO RECOMMEND.  At 116 minutes, SAVING GRACE B. JONES is just too darn long.  It&#8217;s clear to see why this is a favorite of critics &#8211; it indicts small-town America for something the entire world has difficulty with, and that&#8217;s recognizing not only how to deal with deep-rooted psychological problems but also how to deal with them &#8211; and critics love to see America brought to its knees.  At best, JONES is the kind of film that might be worthy of film club study; otherwise, it&#8217;s pretty easy to see why this one took so long to find a distributor to the masses at large.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Arc Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of SAVING GRACE B. JONES by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",Negative
"It has to be acknowledged that in a series like this creating a second season that is as good as the first one is a tall order. The reason for me saying this is that in the first season, the writers had the advantage of being able to surprise us over and over. The simple explanation of the micro-expressions and how they helped to detect lying was fascinating. That is a tool they do not have anymore. Therefore, this led them to compensate by incorporating some over the top stories and introduce much more action in the episodes.In the first half of the season there were several episodes that had to do with terrorism, and these were the ones that I enjoyed the least. There were of course elements of the plot that had to do with what the Lightman group does, but there was a lot of action and suspense as the main ingredients. I typically enjoy series that use these, but in ""Lie to me"" I am looking for something different. I was glad to see that in the second half they found a way to balance the normal activities of the group with a little less action.There were several episodes that had to do with personal situations related to the main characters, and I enjoyed this very much. Be it Lightman's daughter, Foster's love interest or Torres' sister, these are fun to watch when you have spent time getting to know the characters. As usual, Tim Roth's performance is top notch and he robs the accolades in this regard.When I finished watching this season I was sad to realize that I only have a few more episodes left in season 3 and that the show would be over after that, which tells me that I am still enjoying this series quite a bit.",Positive
"Clich&eacute; after clich&eacute; after clich&eacute;, does not deliver. Not even randomly. The procedural is just so bad that it could have worked as a joke, but it instead tries to be too serious. The writing is painful Of the two main characters, she is as stiff, boring, and sanctimonious as the worst parody of a career woman attempts to be. He is a clown disguised as what I guess was meant to be a New York yuppie with suits and sneakers, bear, and hat. The love story is without chemistry. Naturally. The episodes plots are lame.",Negative
"David Suchet is wonderful in these productions and portrays Agatha Christie's Poirot perfectly. The director, the music and the actors are excellent.",Positive
"This is a slightly different kind of horror film. The film opens with Niamh (Missy Keating) a withdrawn bruised child, clearly the victim of abuse. In her nightmarish world, Niamh has the ability to not only detect abuse in others, but has developed some kind of telekinetic protection which goes from what appears to be haphazard to controlled.It isn't long before Niamh is an orphan living with her loving neighbors being questioned by the police.I liked &#34;The Village of the Damned&#34; feel that the film projected. However most of the time I kept waiting for something to happen, even while things were going on.  The movie was careful to not show actual child abuse, but would show you bruises. The first few times left me wondering because of the camera cut away. Was she being abused? Was it her imagination?This is a psychological horror with a limited audience.Parental Guide: No F-bombs or sex. Brief nudity (Clare Barrett)",Negative
I do not understand why this show was cancelled.  It had me both in stitches and on the edge of my seat to see what antics the characters were going to get themselves into.  I would love it if they brought this show back with all the original cast.,Positive
"""Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files"" is a series originally aired at ScyFy. It follows a team of people investigating real or perceived paranormal phenomena, from UFOs and ghosts to mermaids and (surprise) the Honey Island Swamp Monster. The team attempts to re-enact various ""paranormal"" scenarios to see if they really lack a mundane explanation. The whole thing reminds me of ""Finding Bigfoot"", but with a broader scope. And yes, the women on this show more skin than the BRFO's tomboy Ranae...Somewhat surprisingly, ""Fact or Faked"" takes a mostly sceptical angle on the problems under investigation. My favourite is the debunking of the bizarre urban legend about ghost children in Texas pushing cars up a slope. The team finds out that even school buses (!) are being ""pushed"" up the slope at the place in question...but unfortunately the whole thing is an optical illusion. It's really a downslope!Another classic is the debunking of ""Dr. Jonathan Reed"", who claims that his Golden Retriever was killed by a crazy alien in the Cascade Mountains. The alien had an obelisk-shaped craft. Reed killed the intruder, took the body to his cabin but lost all evidence during a burglary. Conclusion? About as fake as you can possibly get! I admit that I didn't like the debunking of the poor old Honey Island Swamp Monster, though. I mean, I happen to believe in such stuff. But perhaps there is hope after all, since ""Fact or Faked"" haven't been able to explain the mysterious Nightcrawler of Fresno. But sure, I suppose it could be a hungry shorebird looking for the closest fast food place!Despite the mostly sceptical angle, not everyone is pleased with the paranormal files. Both the CSI and the James Randi Educational Foundation have published a highly critical review of the series. It seems ""Fact or Faked"" don't rule out *all* paranormal phenomena, and occasionally makes a few gaffes. Orb spider, anyone? So while true believers might think an Illuminati plot is behind this one, the sceptical community see it as yet another paranormal ""fifth column"". Pseudo-sceptics fighting pseudo-sceptics? Will the real sceptic please stand up, LOL! As C.S. Lewis would say: ""Really, we are hard to please""...Personally, I think ""Fact or Faked"" is somewhat uneven, with some episodes being pretty boring, while others are more interesting, even intriguing. However, since I want to annoy the CSI this week, I'm willing to oversee the Honey Island debunking and give this series...four stars. How about that?",Positive

"&#8220;V/H/S&#8221; is one of those movies that simply shouldn&#8217;t work.  For one, a Video Home System (VHS) is a quaintly outdated technology, along the lines of the Atari 2600.  Kids today have no idea what it means to &#8220;tape&#8221; something since nothing is actually on tape.  But that&#8217;s irrelevant, because &#8220;V/H/S&#8221; mines that nostalgia for its creep factor &#8211; that&#8217;s right, modern horror movies now treat VHS like 80s horror movies treated black-and-white films.  Don&#8217;t you feel old?&#8220;V/H/S&#8221; is essentially a short story collection of horror tales, similar to &#8220;Tales from the Crypt.&#8221; The difference is that the films are each &#8220;found footage&#8221; &#8211; the premise being that these are movies someone could make themselves  &#8220;V/H/S&#8221; does acrobatics to make this premise work, but if you can look past that, it&#8217;s actually a creepy collection of horror stories.The framing story, &#8220;Tape 56,&#8221; makes no bones about its protagonists &#8211; unlike typical Stephen King films where being slovenly or rude is grounds to be eaten by a monster, the reality film crew who decides to take on this job to find tape 56 are bottom-feeding scum who assault women by tearing off their tops and filming it.  They are, in essence, the oozing reality of the nastiest part of the Internet. With no morals to speak of, they eagerly take on a high-paying job to break into a house to retrieve tape 56, only to discover an old man dead before a bank of televisions screens filled with white noise. Of course, the old man isn&#8217;t quite as dead as they believe, and in an effort to find the tape the various criminals (geniuses all) play the tapes, alone with the dead body, to see if they can find the right tape. SPOILER ALERT: This is a terrible idea.A crook plunks in a video, a blue screen winds up, and we&#8217;re off to our first short story, &#8220;Amateur Night.&#8221;  This little film, one of the better ones, features another icky plot: Clint (said amateur) is wearing spycam glasses that record his every move with the intent of creating amateur porn by getting women drunk and taking them back to a hotel. They get more than they bargained for with Lily, who really, really likes Clint.  This is a standard femme fatale film that rises above its source material because it&#8217;s not afraid to delve into the squick of amateur porn.&#8220;Second Honeymoon&#8221; features a couple on a road trip, Sam and Stephanie. After a mysterious female stranger asks Sam for a ride and he rebuffs her, we see the camcorder turned on the sleeping arguments and menaced with a knife (among other nasty things). The twist ending may catch some viewers by surprise.&#8220;Tuesday the 17th&#8221; features three friends and archetypes &#8211; Joey, Spider, Samantha, and Wendy &#8211; on a camping trip that retraces the steps of a mass murder the previous year.  It turns out one of the members is actually playing a cat-and-mouse game with the slasher, who still haunts the grounds, and what could easily be a rehash of &#8220;H20&#8221; turns into a thrilling battle of wits and grainy video effects.&#8220;The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily when She Was Younger&#8221; is an intriguing premise between Emily, who believes she is slowly losing her mind, and James, her boyfriend who also happens to be a doctor. Their video chats slowly get more and more strange, beginning with a haunting and becoming much worse than that.  This segment is filled with so many plot twists it threatens to unravel, but the shocking conclusion (and the complicity of its antagonist) works well.&#8220;10/31/98&#8221; features Chad, Matt, Tyler, and Paul dressed up in the late 90s for a Halloween party.  They end up at the wrong place and stumble upon a human sacrifice. Thinking at first this is all part of a haunted house &#8211; milked for considerable laughs &#8211; the Scooby gang finally realizes it&#8217;s not a joke and start taking things seriously. They try to rescue the sacrifice in question, to their ultimate detriment.&#8220;V/H/S&#8217;s&#8221; quality is determined by its short films, and although they are a little uneven, there&#8217;s not a stinker in the bunch. If there&#8217;s a weak point, it&#8217;s the overarching narrative, filled with nonsensical rationale and stupid victims.  But since they had it coming, and the collected videos are so good, it&#8217;s easy to overlook.",Positive
"Just good not get interested in it though the actress is phenomenal and one of my favorite.  I gave it until half way through the second episode.  Probably would have been better as a movie.  That being said, the acting is great; the scenes are good; but, the plot goes on and on without capturing me.  I cannot say that I won't go back to the series, but at this time there are a lot of ole authors, shows, and series to catch up on.",Positive
"I like this show.  My mom and I watch it.  Great singing and interesting stories.  But, it has started to get a bit, out of hand.  I mean, If I didn't know any better, I would aware that this episode was from 1990.  First, I mean, being afraid to be in an interracial couple.  Really?  Seemed so 20 years ago.  Then, when the guy went over to help the guy from getting beaten up.  How did those people low he was gay?  They said &#34;look another one.&#34;  I guess they just knew.  Plus, beating up someone because they are gay, again, really?  What is it 1980s Texas.  It is not even like they were beating up a kid.  It was a man.  Then and finally, the girl was talking to the guy saying &#34;were not in high school anymore.&#34;  I mean, what's it been 6 months since they graduated?  Maybe it has been longer.  They keep having the freaking people come back.  On top of all that, oh, sorry if I said that was the last thing, for a long time, none of the kids live like high school kids.  Drinking, smoking, sex and drugs.  It's like a 70s drive in movie.  It has just gotten so far from what the show started out as.  At least it seems that way to me.  But, I will watch until the end.  I have watched for years and am not one to give up.",Negative
Easy to follow recipes. I like how they modernize the classics. I'm even venturing into the world of baking since I've been watching America's Test Kitchen. I'm glad I don't have to wait a week between episodes anymore.,Positive
"Another excellent documentary from Ken Burns.It's easy to look at this and make comparisons to the current war on drugs, but that isn't necessary to enjoy this excellent story.How political movements are created, maintained, and eventually collapse is part of the lesson from this tale of woe.Once or twice, I fell over from laughing. For example, most of the politicians who voted for the Volstead Act didn't read it and therefore were surprised when wine and beer were banned as well. This was after 50 years of the prohibition movement and nearly 30 years of it being a prominent national level movement with what we would consider PACs.The stories of the prominent bootleggers and how they became what they were was incredible. I especially like the criminal defense lawyer who decided to become a bootlegger after seeing his clients pay a fine using thousand dollar bills.Moreover, the ""first wiretap"" story was very enlightening. With all of the other rights in the Constitution, one can argue about what they mean, but privacy is a bit odd. What exactly does a reasonable man consider?  If rights are inalienable, then who cares what is reasonable, rights are what they are period. In any event, even in today's privacy challenged world, don't think the Supreme Court feels quite the same way that they once did with wiretaps.A good story. An important part of American History that might have obvious (and not so obvious) parallels to the modern day.",Positive
"I wasn't sure I'd like this show, but I do!  It's a little... redneck meets the Walton's and I love it.  Plenty of learning points along the way as they get into some crazy adventures.",Positive
Enjoyed the first season and I hope there is a second.  I like the premises and hope a second season will explore more of that question. I also liked the actors as they portray the investigators who have to figure out &#34;what's going on&#34;.  This having been made more complex with the loss of one of the characters. Hmmm.....,Positive
I just love the competition . The rotating judges are a good idea also. I have been fortunate enough to have been exposed to the preparation of food through friends and associates. Great Show,Positive
"I love Dexter, who knew being so bad could be so good. love the concept of the show, its something different for me to watch with all the detective shows out there. Would most surely recommend. The show is about a serial killer who only kills bad people and serial killers.",Positive
"I grew up on Star Wars, Star Trek and loved Battlestar Gallactica.  I am a nerd and proud of it.  I do not like gratuitous sex references and drug use.  Get rid of that, make it more spoofy of the great space shows of the past and give Feldenbaum some great straight man lines.  I'd give it another watch if you made more.",Negative
This is the start of a killer Italian girl drama sitcom baby! I love these girls big time! Everyone should have this in your collection!,Positive

"""It's like she's invading my mind, even when I'm alone I can't escape her."" Rebecca (Bolger) is ready for her new school year to start. After the death of her father she is grateful to get back to her friends. She is surprised when a new girl, Ernessa (Cole) shows up. What starts off as a new girl trying to make friends turns into something much more dangerous and Rebecca becomes suspicious of her when her friends turn up missing, or dead. I will start by saying that this movie is overall not that bad. I also once again have to say that I'm pretty sure I am not the audience this movie was made for. This is a horror movie about an all girls high school. Being a 30 year old man I couldn't relate. The movie did have an overused idea, but pulled it off in a way that made it feel interesting. There are some pretty creepy parts in this and Lily Cole is perfect in this role but I had a hard time getting into it. If you like movies like ""The Roommate"" you will probably like this one as well. Overall, not a bad movie at all. I was entertained but if I was a teen girl I probably would have liked it more. I give it a B-",Negative
"If you're like me you didn't even consider watching dollhouse because of the name, ick. After rolling my eyes at the show I now find out it's by Joss Whedon and Eliza Dushku is the main star...well how can you go wrong? If you like the other Joss Whedon shows you'll like this one, lots of action, imaginative scripts, and good acting. It's also nice to see the familiar faces from other shows, especially because some of them are playing such different parts...I guess I shouldn't admit it, because it shows how tacky I am, but suddenly I realize they can act, as opposed to those actors that can only do well in one type of role.Some of Joss Whedon's shows took a season to really get going but the script and cast is tight from the pilot with dollhouse, oh and now that I understand the name I like it. Definitely give this show a shot.",Positive
"The final season of The Office was very good, in my opinion.Gone was Robert California. Also, the absence of Ed Helms due to other projects (I guess) was ver well handled.There were some very good ideas, like the documentary crew appearing in some scenes (one of them protecting Pam from being attacked).The extras are very good, showing some audition, blooper reel, etc.All in all, one of the best shows I've ever watched.",Positive
The boys never fail to surprise and delight. Is delight the word? It's all very weird and full of tropes and memes and other 21st centry blather. Just in a very good way. Very funny.,Positive
"As always, another great season, but at this point, we wouldn't expect anything less.  I love the new places they are traveling to, it's always exciting to see what's outside my own backyard.",Positive
I liked this show and was sad to see it leave the air. but now I'm watching it all over again. Mary is quite the cynic to start it is amazing to watch her grow over the seasons.,Positive
"So enlightening about the sources of our food and what is actually nutritious.  Of course, I worked for a meat packer and was steered away from the slaughter floor several decades ago, but somehow it just seemed necessary.  Older is wiser and a revisit to the scene makes me question what I eat though years ago I reduced serving sizes and use some vegetable protein in cooking I was still eating fish, eggs, milk products etc.  Well produced to direct you to thinking about what you are putting in your body at who's expense.  Watch it with your kids.  Definitely more important than gun control and can save your life.",Positive
"Ringer was on of the best mystery shows that has been on TV in a long time. Playing twin sisters, Sarah Michelle Gellar proved once again why she is one of the best television actresses ever. The plot and the characters of Ringer were just something that hasn't been done and the story was executed amazingly. It's such a travesty that The CW doesn't care what their fans want, and that is to bring back Ringer for a second season. We need more SMG in our lives.",Positive
"This show is on fire! I'm so addicted to it. You never know which way the plot is going, it keeps your guessing until the very end, then it leaves you with a hanger...I cannot wait until season 6!!!!",Positive
"For me, the interviews and array of footage in this documentary are what make it so enjoyable.50% of our happiness is determined by our genetic composition, 10% of our happiness is based on our surrounding and 40% is unknown, leaving you to wonder if you can truly determine your own happiness in life. Personally I think yes. At the end of the day it is up to you whether you're going to let any stimuli effect your mood in any way. Everyone is different but one thing is for certain, we need outside stimuli to help process an emotional feed.This film visits many different cultures throughout the movie which really gives you a different perspective of what makes everyone happy or unhappy, regardless of their social or economic background. I would recommend watching this movie in a class or group environment as it fuels great topics of discussion. Two things to keep in mind is that this film is not a &#34;how to be happy&#34; and it does not go into discussion about people who may have disorders that would or could otherwise take control of their responses to stimuli (whether internal or external).",Positive
"This show is a series of melodramatic storylines and overly-pop-styled songs that numb the brains of people matured beyond childhood and the tweens.  These eye-roll-inducing scenes are punctuated by genuinely funny appearances by Jane Lynch.  Her comedy is a raw, edgy, intelligent addition to a show that is basically the demons of American Idol possessing a school.If you are a fan of American Idol, Disney teeny bopper shows, and show tunes, watch this.  If not, run for the hills!Vapid melodrama run amuck with Jane Lynch injected to help you keep your sanity.AVOID.",Negative
"Every time I think this show has hit it's peak, it surprises me with even more blood, romance, drama, suspense and general nail biting craziness. I'm obsessed.p.s. - watch The Originals too!! Best spin off of all time!!",Positive
I enjoyed the acting and the story. A fairy tale mixed with mystery. It takes  on  an old fairy tale and updates it.,Positive
"Fellini it ain't, but Burn Notice is a well made entertainment with watchable people and a snarky sense of humor. The story is about a fired American spy, who seems to have some lethal enemies up high, but the episodes are - well - episodic, as he takes on various violent jobs to make a living while trying to find out who did what to him in DC. In a sense, Burn Notice is a story about families - Donovan, his ex-girlfriend (Gabrielle Anwar - very watchable and funny), and his best friend making up one family, the members of whom are always there for each other, though not without the resentments and egos of real family. In addition, Donovan also has a ""real"" family with whom he has issues - an annoying mother (Sharon Gless) and an irresponsible brother (whose character actually seems to develop over time.) The acting ranges from appropriately deadpan (the lead actor, Jeffrey Donovan, who is good here and was even better in the much mourned Touching Evil) to appropriately over-the-top (various villains.) Two objections: 1. The story is set in Miami, but there are no African-Americans. Why not? and 2: Why is Sharon Gless both under-used and confined to one whining note? She's a good actress and could do so much more. Still, all in all, a winner in the light entertainment mode - light years better than so-called reality TV.",Positive
This show is terribly addictive! I had heard about if from some friends and gave them the &#34;whateve&#34; eye roll. Then I watched the first episode. Great! I've been strung out like a junky ever since. I can't wait for the next episode.,Positive
Since much of my family comes from Scotland and Ireland this series interests me a lot. Combine the rich and very interesting Celt history with music by Enya and it's a fantastic program.,Positive
From the beginning to the end of each show I truly can say tha each character is wonderful. It's a family that stays together and deal with everything that comes before them without no avail. I truly enjoy each season. Don't stop the show at all I love it.,Positive
"Great show. If you are a fan of Spy Thrillers this series is perfect for you. Set at the pinnacle of the Cold War during the 1980's Reagan Era, with flashbacks to earlier formative events, this series highlights the struggle of deep cover operatives living behind enemy lines, as the enemy. The twist lays in fact that the main protagonists are Soviet Agents. The series is smart and well written. It has more to offer than just thrills and action also. The protagonists have a family so the dynamic that their secret lives layer on top of the day to day struggles of parenthood in very interesting ways.",Positive
"Chris Rock's facial expressions are worth watching in this somewhat overlooked little gem that sends up US attitudes toward the French. Julie Delpy is surprisingly funny, too, as the French girlfriend caught in the middle as her dysfunctional French family spends a couple days in NYC. Many funny moments throughout. Absurdity is the overall tone. Don't look for plot. Just watch the characters interact.",Positive
Another fantastic season for Doctor Who. My son and I enjoyed this episode thoroughly.,Positive

I love the imagination and creativity Olivia has.  My 3 year old daughter has a very creative imagination and finds a kindred spirit in this character,Positive
"One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire' this is a complex, Dickensian study of human nature,not afraid of asking big questions, and meticulously plotted like agreat novel, so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire' used the overly familiar clich&eacute;' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions, and 'BattlestarGalactica' uses the sci-fi series, and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person's sci fi, in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke,or Isaac Asimov. It's about why we are how we are, what it means to bea human being, morality under constant pressure in times of war,fathers and sons, impossible loves, metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife, far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes, and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days. It's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good, and some cast members areremarkable, creating characters full of depth, complexity andcontradiction. The writing is terrific, allowing the characters tochange and grow, but always in ways that make sense, creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums, only to find surprising, sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us. The special effects are generally very impressive for TV,even if they're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I've everseen, and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away. I was sad to get to the last episode, just as one is sad tofinish a great book.I haven't bought it in other forms, so I can't compare, but generallythe blu-ray set (the non-Cylon box) is quite complete, and well packaged.However, I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problemand I didn't escape the bugs. On a couple of my discs there wasa slight 'pulse' to the image at times. At first I thought perhapsit was a strange, but intentional, lighting effect, but looking at it carefullyit seemed more a reproduction problem.This isn't just the intentionally added grain, a look I don't love, but acceptas an artistic decision.Since then, I've read similar comments from others, so I'm not crazy(or at least not in this case!). So, if you do order this, you might wantto make sure it's returnable, and try to do a quick quality check the bestyou can. Of course, if the problem is intermittent, and mostly in the laterdiscs, as was in my case, by the time I saw it it was way too lateto ask for an exchange.None-the-less, for me, the quality of the content way over-rode theoccasional image problems (and I'm a perfectionist - my wifenever noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out.).As far as getting the individual seasons on blu-ray, it looks as thoughyou can do better buying the box set, although prices fluctuatequickly here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I'd advise you do the mathand figure out the most reasonable way to own the complete set.Also, Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray boxset for about $100 with shipping.  It seems to have all the same extrasas the US box set.  Well worth considering as long as the price holds up.",Positive
If you like Sci-fi then you will love the second season of Falling Skies. Awesome show great acting good story.,Positive
Not enough humorous moments.  Typical try-to-hard to be funny but falls flat.  But that's just me.  A 15 year old may get more out of it.,Negative
I love this show. All the actors are amazing. I love love love this show.. Season 5 was very great!!,Positive
"I never saw the original mini-series or the TV series that followed in the 1980's. I don't even think I was born when it first aired, but I knew the story and looked forward to this updated version with better FX and acting. For some reason they showed the first four episodes last fall, then held off until March 2010 to continue the season. What a way to lose viewers ABC.The whole cast is pretty good, other than the annoying son, whose sole purpose is to get on my nerves. Elizabeth Mitchell from LOST, Morena Baccarin from Firefly (now sporting a short haircut that only she can pull off) and Laura ""Supergirl"" Vandervoort from Smallville lead an attractive cast of women that kick butt and look good doing it. Baccarin as the leader of the lizard aliens, Anna, is by far the standout in my opinion. The combination of the way she looks and talks is a perfect match for the alien charged with making all of use Earthlings follow her every word.As of this moment, we are only 8 episodes in and the characters are getting more fleshed out with each passing week. We are also getting a piece by piece look at what the aliens look like under the fake human skin suits. I read that ABC will probably get rid of Flashforward or V. I watch them both, but V is a much better show that deserves at least another season. I don't have a love for V like I do for the show that comes on right before it, LOST, but it's fun to watch and the writers keep the twists coming.",Positive
"While I still keep up with DOWNTON ABBEY, I'm always reminded of its &#34;comfort food&#34; vibe when I come across a superior production with a similar setting, of which PARADE'S END offers a Prime (pun intended) example.  Tom Stoppard's writing is more subtle and cutting that that of Julian Fellowes, the Ford Maddox Ford storylines feel less soapy, and there are superb supporting performances throughout - Rufus Sewell is a hoot and Roger Allam functions like a male version of DA's Maggie Smith.  I do feel some ambivalence towards the 3 leads.  Although he's an excellent actor, Cumberbatch has definitely been over-exposed in the last couple of years and while there's nothing particularly wrong about his performance here, I wish he'd let someone else have a go. Rebecca Hall is also very good as usual, but I keep feeling she's physically wrong for the part.  Adelaide Clemens looks her part and emotes decently, but I keep seeing a younger Rebecca Hall in the role.  Still it's absorbing viewing and a compact enough mini-series that doesn't overstay its welcome, unlike the other aforementioned British import.",Positive
"Loved this series.  Interesting, different, wonderful performances and very well directed.  Couldn't ask for more.  Look forward very much to season 2!",Positive
Never heard of them but now I can wait to see them again and again. Will have you laugh out loud for sure.,Positive

"If the value of a story is to draw one from enjoying the story to wishing the characters lived on your block, then Jam and Jerusalem was a terrific success. My only hope is that BBC decides that this is one show worth bringing back at a later time.",Positive

"I love this genre but just could not get into this series.Girl leaves town with no gas in the tank, bar full of people ignoring the firetruck as it blasts out a warning that the radioactive mushroom cloud is coming in 45 minutes, the only two cars on the road within 10 miles and they run head on into each other?

"Perhaps more than anything else, I am surprised by the number of reviews and the seeming lack of interest in this series! Are we all so well versed that we would presume to know this part of US history? Are we not interested enough in US history to take the time to view these episodes? Admittedly, my education and studies have included a reasonable overview but I still find the series of interest and to be informative! Well presented accurate information with an interesting format, original footage and photographs? For those who would think this uninteresting, I would ask if you are familiar with the information.

"While I gave this series five stars, streaming through Amazon Prime didn't fare so well. There were frequent interruptions including several that suggested that I contact Amazon to deal with the problem. I did this only to find a neat list of possible solutions. These solutions were only relevant to problems caused by my 'smart' TV, other equipment and/or steaming service. I gave up midway though one episode and will try again by streaming via HDMI cable from my desktop....",Positive

"""The Innkeepers"" is a thinking person's ghost story. That is what the latest effort from writer/director Ti West (""The House of the Devil"") attempts to be. He would not resort to such familiar tricks as gores and loud noises to scare his audiences. That is a good thing. Unfortunately, the premise of ""The Innkeepers,"" good as it is, ends up being poorly executed. In short, the film is atmospheric and sporadically scary, but all in all tedious.""The Innkeepers"" centers on two hotel clerks Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) working for The Yankee Pedlar Inn that will close down soon. The hotel, it is rumored, is haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a bride who died a tragic death many years ago. Claire and Luke, both enthusiastic about ghost stories and other paranormal activities, Claire and Luke, start investigating the legendary ghost, equipped with ghost hunting gear.Ti West as director employs a slow-burn approach for the first hour or so, keeping the pace deliberately slow with false alarms. That is not a bad idea. Then, while he ratchets up the tension towards the climax, he also leaves the interpretation of several key events open to our imagination. The problem is, most viewers would lose interest in what is going on before the film finally gets interesting.""The Innkeepers"" takes too much time in setting up the characters and the inn's back stories. Claire is a college drop-out who does not know what she wants to do, while Luke is a self-proclaimed paranormal investigator. Besides that, not much is revealed about them. With the arrival of former actress Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) as a guest, who gives a warning to Claire, the story finally knows where it should go.Even then, without a compelling storyline and teasing details, the film keeps us waiting for the climax that is pretty good. Until then ""The Innkeepers"" is all about suggestions and insinuations about what to come in the end, but the characters' motives remain unclear and unconvincing, and the suggested mysteries are not intriguing. Not saying everything is a time-tested technique to build interest and tension, to be sure, but taking too much time to do so (and saying too little for that matter) is a different thing.",Negative
"...with this show, but the acting is good and so is the suspense. &#34;Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.&#34; I'm not a religious person, but I read the bible when I was a kid and remember many parts of it.

"Spoilers aside, the philosophy that we are what we eat is false; we are what we are forced to do to survive.  We humans, will use our skills to protect our future by manipulating our present.  I know, that is so obvious to us once it is said and uncovered.  This show tries to uncover it for us, letting us peek at it.  In my mind, it comes close, but misses a bull's eye by &#34;that much&#34; &#60;pinched fingers&#62;. There is plenty of action and miraculous stuff to lead us on to a 'what if' conclusion, but somehow it isn't as satisfying as it should be.  Great character development, though, and that alone keeps me coming back for more in hope they'll get it right this next time. Welcome to the curse of humanity, &#34;hope is eternal.&#34;",Positive

"A slow abstract meditation on death that is not at all entertaining.  You're probably not going to actually like this, or glean much from it.  Don't feel guilty.  Just because a movie like this is generally unwatchable and quite impenetrable doesn't make it high art.  I submit that you that this is really just fetishistic weirdness dressed up as sophisticated musing.",Negative
Love the concept of a unidentified threat. I feel like the plot is thought out and complex. The actors are fine actors who generally do a good job of conveying the fear and confusion. However I think the dialogue and personalities the writers gave them are weak. Many of their actions make no sense even for a panicked person. There is also too much filler dialogue...the usual &#34;are you ok?&#34; type. I just think the character personalities are a little confusing and could be polished and the dialogue could be expanded but a good overall shows with a convincing concept and cast that needs more pop and direction.,Positive
"I don't know anything about the book series this is based on, so I can't speak to that. I think the series has potential, mainly because of it's star.  Welliver is very talented, and if this were to continue to series, I would hope the writers would give him more to do and play than &#34;angry man&#34;.  You've got the talent, let him use it!  I would give the series a chance if it continues.",Negative
"Let's face it; when a person dies, most likely he just vanishes into the ether.  And no matter what people think, that same person probably did not exist before birth either.  (I'll accept life at conception as well.)  But good luck trying to prove life after death, heaven or hell, etc. etc.  Any of these positions is unprovable so arguing is just a waste of time.I did think about the film ""The Exorcist"" while watching ""My Amityville Horror.""  If you've ever watched that much-earlier-and-much-better film on disk, William Friedkin gives a very nice introduction beforehand by saying something like, ""What you bring to the film you will get out of it.  If you believe in evil, it will affect you in a certain way.  If you don't, then your experience will be different.""  I'm paraphrasing a bit, but that was pretty much the gist of it.  But in retrospect, I do believe that Mr. Friedkin wasn't exactly correct; I believe that ""The Exorcist"" is a danged scary movie no matter what belief system you have.And this documentary tries to spook you a little bit as well, but I don't think that it actually works.  No, let's say that it fails miserably.  Just because someone such as Lorraine Warren makes some assertion doesn't mean that I will necessarily believe that assertion myself.  And let's face another fact; without going for some cheap ad hominems -- which I could easily do and have seen others try with this film -- I didn't find Daniel Lutz to be exactly the most credible witness ever.  It made me think of another documentary that I didn't much like, ""I Survived BTK.""  Both films should have been quite gripping, but in reality, I found both of them to be quite suspect, mostly because of issues with the main characters in both films.I have seen the original ""Amityville Horror"" quite a few times, and I still remember watching it the first time.  While I was much younger, it did scare the hell out of me, especially the scene in the basement where the dog gets dragged down to hell, assuming that hell exists.  It's too bad that this film didn't get my attention as much as that one, at least in other ways.  After thinking about it for one night, I'm changing my score from a 3 to a 2, and that's mostly because I turned it off with about 10 minutes to go.  It's just almost unwatchable.",Negative
"&#34;Vikings&#34; is a very significant elegant series about the period when the Vikings started invading England. The plot, writing, setting(s), and character development is outstanding. I believe it is a reflection of the true history and cultures of the time. It is very worth watching.",Positive
"Informative and beautiful (people, setting, cars). Interesting family interdynamics, but always respectful to the characters. I like the idea of treating people regardless of what they can pay.",Positive
"I do like the show; love a few of the characters (when they are not behaving like 3rd graders). There have been seasons that I loved, and seasons where they spent more time being horrible to each other or incredibly immoral to patients. I realize that &#34;moral&#34; can be varied, so what I mean is...endangering lives of patients for the sake of ego, entitlement or self-interest. And yet, I like the show...so I fast forward or skip/skim episodes to see if there will be parts worth watching or not. This season managed to balance itself fairly well, and had the characters making big choices and mostly handling them in a way that didn't make me hit FF.",Positive
"While it isn't better than the 5th season, it certainly has all the ingredients of a great Dr. Who series.  Matt Smith continues to portray an exciting and energetic Dr and the writers continue creating edge of your seat episodes.  I cannot wait until the second half of season 7.",Positive
"My husband and I really liked this pilot.  We were pulled into the story, the dialogue was well-written and the actors were really exceptional.  This program gets our vote for continuation.  When the pilot ended, we looked at each other with the &#34;oh no, what if they don't continue this???&#34; look on our faces.  Two thumbs up.",Positive
"Great show, something different and with great twists in the story line.  Can't wait for season 3 to come on!",Positive
"Realizing that the pilot episode must set the plot, tone and characterization for the entire series, I liked this show but didn't love it.  However, if it continues to flesh out those points, it will be worth watching.  Will I ever give it 5 stars?  Possibly, but now, at a solid 4, I will be back.",Positive
But we hate waiting for new episodes! My husband really enjoy this show. We wish there were more episodes quicker. Hurry!!!!,Positive
I didn't like season 2 quite as well as season 1. I felt like it got progressively more violent instead of more interesting. Perhaps  that's to be expected as he becomes more and more involved in the lives of various citizens. Some of these families are like the Hatfields and McCoys; there is bad blood between them and you just know there is bound to be violence in the picture.,Negative
Covert Affairs is an enjoyable series with a woman lead character. The supporting cast make an entertaining program seem totally believable. Where else can a very light weight woman beat off men and women and not sustain one scratch?,Positive
"A really creative drama.  I started off the series hating everyone and their criminal incompetence, but loved watching the evolution of the quiet high school science teacher into a ruthless drug dealer.  I know, you're not supposed to approve of this message, and I don't, but I couldn't take my eyes off the series.  What tension, twists of plot, surprises, and so much fun.

"For those of you who like the show iCarly, this season is a really nice one. These teenagers with their hot new material is great for a nice laugh, and it is cool to show in front of the kids. As the show continues, Carly, Sam and Freddie get into more epidemics that America loves to watch. The show may be over, but the shows episodes are still great. And watching them over again will make you smile and/or laugh. Watching this show will more than likely show you that life is what you make it. This show started because few teens who who got in trouble were scheduled to pick out kids for a show as punishment for a photo. They turned out to have a good laugh while joking around about the teacher. The teacher tells them to upload their videos of kids, but Freddie unintentionally uploads them being hilarious. From their jokes about the teachers, the people see it, laugh, and suggest that Carly and Sam should to turn it into a webshow. They turned a punishment into a great and successful internet show. And then they went forward from there. Go ahead and check out what they made. You won't be disappointed.",Positive

"I'm not a huge John John Malkovich fan, but this seems like one of those rare occasions when actor and role seem perfectly matched to produce an entertaining movie. Malkovich plays Buck Howard, a failing magician loosely based on the Amazing Kreskin. Malkovich's character is both corny and charming. He undergoes a transformation from being frustrated with his fate of performing for small-town America, to finding the his big break didn't necessarily bring him what he most needed. Meanwhile, Colin Hanks (Tom Hank's son) plays a young man searching for himself after dropping out of law school. Ultimately, this movie isn't a slapstick comedy and you probably won't find yourself laughing out loud. Nonetheless, it has some funny moments and is a breath of fresh air compared to the stale comedies Hollywood has been producing (with their utterly predictable plots).I found myself unable to predict where exactly the story was going or what would happen next to Buck Howard - and I loved that. Hopefully you will too.",Positive
Season is light hearted with multiple story lines. Sometimes Mr Longworth can stretch the realities of the law. Show does stretch Fla geography by trying to make every town less than 1/2 hr apart but this show is about entertainment.,Positive
"I had low expectations for ""Retreat,"" and so was pleasantly surprised at just how engaging it turned out to be.  As one of the actors notes in the Special Features, the movie is almost like a play, with nearly all of the action taking place on the single ""stage"" of the cabin.  This could get dull, but with well-drawn characters and a central riddle (is the stranger nuts, telling the truth...what's going on with him?), the story pulls the viewer along nicely.  Spoiler alert:When the twist arrives, it might remind you of the one in ""The Masque of the Red Death"" orVertical Run, but I didn't see it coming, and it was a satisfying plot hinge.",Positive

"I've been an Olivia Wilde fan since House so I saw she was in this and wanted to watch it. It was pretty good. I thought Wilde and Garner were really funny. The other actors were pretty good too, especially the dad of the girl when he was talking about the butter police. I'm not sorry I rented it but if I had a re-do, I probably wouldn't of spent 9.99 to rent it and would've waited until after it came out on DVD to rent it for cheaper. Overall, I enjoyed watching.",Positive
"I have never like the Zombie genre.  Just dumb to me.  All the gore and guts and brains eating.  And the premise was ludicrous.  THEN along came The Walking Dead.  If you don't know, this show isn't really about Zombies at all.  Sure, it's full of Zombies, and the gore that goes along with rotten dead people-things who chase you down and eat you alive, but that's not what this show is about.  If you will give it a few episodes you will see what I mean.  It's really about people surviving against incredible odds.  What would you do to survive if you woke up one morning in the middle of the Lion and Hyena filled plains of Africa?  How about if you found yourself in the middle of the worst rabies epidemic in history?  Or another Black Plaque?  The Zombies in The Walking Dead represent that kind of threat, only a bit funner.  They are ZOMBIES after all, right?As this show has gone on it has grown into a better and better show.  This isn't by accident from interviews that I have seen with it's creator and producers.  Unlike many shows that just seem to go aimlessly from week to week, with the latest trouble to deal with each week - that they DO deal with each week - this show has been building from day one right up to the last episode of this season.  It's put together like a motion picture that might be 2 hours, but this movie is YEARS long.  Which is AWESOME!  It's only gotten better and better season by season and now that the main characters have arrived at __________________ (I don't want to give anything away) it feels like that part in the movie where all the characters have been introduced, the plot established, and the REAL ACTION just begins.  Ever been to a movie where the first 20-30 minutes, the set-up part, were so good that you just said to yourself, &#34;This is going to be GOOD&#34;?  That's where we are with The Walking Dead, only we got to thoroughly enjoy 4 seasons already.  My family and I can hardly wait to see what comes next, as can most people who have been watching this show all along.Do yourself a favor if you have been avoiding this because you don't like zombie movies.  Just set that aside for 3 episodes and watch.  If you don't like it by then, you probably won't like any of the rest of it.  But if you do like it by then, you are in luck because it just gets better and better and better.  The character development is fantastic.  These people in this show come across as real people, not made up hollywood versions of real people.  It's really fascinating to watch how each character develops and grows from the struggles to survive that they endure.Five &#34;Zombified&#34; Stars!",Positive
"Helen Mirren is in my mind the best actress of our time.. I cannot think of a film where she did not shine!  She is able to take on the personna of the character she is playing, she is believable, honest, intelligent, and quite lovely.I recently reviewed the first couple of episodes, and in the first series, the difficult time that DCI Jane Tennison had breakng into the old boy's network, comes full force. The smirks, the lies, the deceit from the men who were so afraid of a woman taking over. When she had her first win, and the men in her department greeted her with cheers and champagne, I ffelt tears in my eyes. I was a woman in the 60's and felt the discrimination and had the bottom pitching. I knew exactly what she went through.  Tom Ball who plays DC Otley, the most despicable liar of the entire team has his comeuppance and none too soon. The other big distinction between the time Helen Mirren plays Tennison and now, is the amount of smoking that took place. A clig in everyone's fingers was not out of place.  We see a little bit of the personal life of Tennison and we cheer her on. She has a difficult time. Always well groomed and well dressed, Tennison is the kind of woman we all want in our lives as a mentor and friend.From an early review of 'Prime Suspect', I found this from the New York Times, ""THINKING back to the impression Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison made when the British crime drama ""Prime Suspect"" first reached America in 1992, it's easy to focus on strength: the hard set of her jaw as she took on the sexism and cronyism of a London police force that, in real life, had only four female detectives out of a total of about 500 at the time."". Sets the mood for the series.'Prime Suspect remains one of my favorite series, certainly because of Helen Mirren, but also the strong, wonderful character she plays, DCI Jane Tennison.Highly Recommended. prisrob 09-01-12State of PlayThe Debt.",Positive
"Great story, excellent acting and character development. Great blend of drama and action, convincing effects. Of course no commercials on Amazon Prime.",Positive
This is worth paying for.  From what I have seen so far with this is a program directed around what most paranormal programs do not.  They go in to detail things that have taken place with unfriendly spirits.  Do hope there are many more investigations on this staffs behalf to come.  Totally watch if this area is an interest to you as it is to me.,Positive
"Season four feels almost like a reboot to the franchise. New cast members, new locations, very interesting stories, and even an alternate reality makes an appearance. I think this is my favorite season of Bones. Thank you to the writers, directors, actors and everyone else who made season four possible!",Positive
"This film definitely has a decent creepy factor, obviously had a generous budget, is adept at maintaining suspense and I liked the connection between psychological and paranormal phenomena however the underlying cause seemed a bit more suited to B-grade horror.  Julianne Moore in the central role gives a performance that lends to the dramatic intensity and overall believability however the added, religious persona seemed a bit clich&eacute; and out of place and although I'm sure Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a fine actor he was fairly underwhelming as the embodiment of ultimate terror.  I think one thing that separates good fiction from mediocrity is when the veil of mystery is pulled back just a bit too far and I think that's why ""6 Souls"" ultimately left me kinda flat.  :(",Negative
I am not sorry I bought season 5 of the Sons of Anarchy I am disappointed with the show. I thought that by now it would be ending since where could it go. It seems that those in charge of it will drag out an ending that makes little sense.Instead of crazy independent this is the way we have to make through life the characters have sunk to the level of this is what we do for every thing. Will they learn how to be regular people or stay killers and thugs?,Positive

"If I could give you only a single reason to see The Great Buck Howard it would be John Malkovich. As one of the most respected actors working today, Malkovich is probably best known for roles playing a bad guy or, at least, a very angry guy...The role of Buck Howard shows a different side of Malkovich, but it's one that is completely delightful.Colin Hanks plays Troy, who one day decides to quit law school with the intent of becoming a writer. To support himself, Troy must find a job. The opportunity comes along in the form of Buck Howard, a mentalist (""magician is a dirty word"") who in his prime appeared on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson 61 times. Now the Great Buck Howard plays small venues with even smaller crowds. Troy becomes Buck's assistant, quietly observing the man who doesn't seem to realize that his days of being great are behind him.It's a simple, low-budget movie that doesn't have anything profound to say but, none-the-less kept me thoroughly entertained.Emily Blunt, Ricky Jay, Steve Zahn, and Tom Hanks (as Troy's father, go figure) round out the principal cast, but despite solid performances from all; this is Malkovich's show.Yes, he's playing against type but there is a certain amount of joy I got from watching him in this role. Buck is not a multi-faceted character; we only really get a look at the stage persona. Troy knows Buck about as well as we do, but Malkovich allows us to see the passion and frustration of the character, even with it barely there. The man is an absolute marvel, truly one of the finest living actors.Is the film great though? No, it's not. It's not a character study or a laugh-out-loud comedy. It's not even very original and some of it's even predictable. However, it has enough charm and wit to warrant recommending it. Buck Howard is a great character and it is a delightful little movie. Tom Arnold's cameo is almost worth the price of a rental, by itself.The Great Buck Howard is not great, but much like the fictional Buck's show; it's disarmingly funny, charming, and very amusing.GRADE: B",Positive
Love this show and it's international intrigue.Good personal stories as well.Acting and story telling get better each season.,Positive
"There have been years where film, music, art, television, and video games have been controlled by a tiny handful of people and they become stale commercial products.  But sooner or later, the maverick breaks through and finds a new way to get his creativity out to the public.  The people with the most passion, talent, and work ethic somehow beat the odds and find their audience.  Though I own a PS3, I am now convinced that the game console war should end and gamers should start directly downloading the most fun and visually different products straight from the developer to their computers.  Microsoft and Sony are obviously scratching and clawing to keep anyone else from making a nickel.",Positive
"This show is never boring. James Spader is very, very good at playing his role. I look forward to watching it every week.",Positive
It is a treasure of travel and learning new life's as they begin!  Much culture is presented to learn. Extremely entertaining as to why these people move.,Positive
"Two years ago, A&E's Storage Wars came out of nowhere and quickly became one of the highest rated shows on cable. The show is extremely addictive and I watch it religiously, but why? Most people think it has something to with the mystery about what's behind the door or the hunt for buried treasure, as usual; I have a different take on things. The reason this show is as popular as is it, is the buyers themselves. Reality TV is about watching real people in real situations. We like to see people who are just like us, struggling to survive, fighting with co-workers, etc. The cast of Storage Wars are people that we can relate to and more than that, they are interesting as well. Every week I can't wait to see what Barry does, who Dave's gonna fight with, and what inappropriate thing Jarrod is going to say to his wife. I believe the show's popularity has little to do with what's behind the door. It's the unique and interesting cast that keeps us coming back for more. The truth is that it doesn't matter if it's storage auction buyers, repo-men, meter maids, or hand fisherman, what we want is people we like and can easily relate to in different situation both inside and out of the office, and Storage Wars provides that and then some.",Positive
"The actors on this show are doing an outstanding job. Unfortunately, the rotating cast of writers is not. The technical, physical and visual effects have been excellent. I'm looking forward to season three. Something I can't say for all television shows out there. The pacing (for a weekly) is quite brisk, the challenges continue to evolve, as do the characters. Hopefully the producers will keep the show on the right track by avoiding some poor writer choices.",Positive
"Definitely my favorite seasons were seasons one through six.  The supporting cast was terrific and the story lines superb.  But what is extra special is the attention to detail and some of the sly humor (esp in the early seasons).  If you love rich settings, incredible acting, British humor and great unpredictable story lines, then you will love Poirot!",Positive
"It's funny but quirky, not as predictable as so many other sitcoms.  I particularly like the two characters of the two seniormost officers, one's gay and one's gun-shy...just funny.",Positive
"This is a stellar adaptation. Of course, read the book, but there's no harm in these BBC versions! They are VERY good.",Positive
"Surprisingly restrained considering the trailer had so many threatening and spooky images. I will say that 'The Orphanage' does get an A for atmosphere, but reading subtitles during this film distracted me from the experience. I usually pass on films with subtitles, but this film seemed too good to pass up and there are always exceptions to the rule. It's a pretty easy film to follow, even though this was played up to be a very spooky film, I found it to be more sad than scary. The DVD transfer looks very good and this is worth seeing, but maybe rent before buying it.",Negative
"Mary McCormac is brilliant in this series. Too bad it ended so soon. Only 5 seasnons, and the 5th season ended after only 8 episodes.",Positive
This season may have been the best...  We enjoy watching Zak make a fashion statement and the other two puppy behind him.  Nick seems poised to get possessed at every turn this season.  Never disappointed with this series.  Zak is obviously autistic...,Positive
"I hoped the best for the second half of season 3, since part one wasn't as good as previous seaosns. But once this part of the season begins, the show gets better than ever. The plots of this season stay away from only wolves and it moves on to different things and it does good, From coyotes, the Nogitsune... everything winds up perfectly. It's good to see that the show can do more than just stories related to werewolves.There's horror, love, and nobody's safe this time. We get to meet new characters but we also say goodbye to some of them. But it's sad they practically replaced Allison with Kira, this time Allison is not as important as she used to be, they made the character so wooden and she only had very few good moments this season.But anyway, every episode is a great episode and I just can't get enough of this show! The writing is superb and season 4 is good so far! Season 3 Part 2 shows us Teen Wolf at its finest.",Positive
As I said with the other seasons I love it and the actores are greatI have watched it about 10 times,Positive
Very good and interesting show with good acting an interesting plots. Hope there will be many more shows and soon.,Positive
I wish there was more.  Loved the series.On a side note Amazon's video quality seems to have improved from just a few months ago.  They need to work on their app for the Roku 3.,Positive

"This series caught my eye not just for the experiment itself but the fact that it was covering a period that the famous Downton Abbey also covers.  It was interesting to see how different tasks got done downstairs but I have to say the most suprising happening was the reaction of the upstairs when they had to leave and the many eye opening moments the butler had.  I hope it gave the two footman inspiration to go far and do well in life.  That upstairs family really need some toughening up, to me they were pathetic in the end.",Positive

"NO SPOILERS:The 4* rating goes more to the potential of the program then the actual premier episode, which drew in +-3.3m viewers.  By comparison, the first season premiers of Burn Notice and White Collar drew 4.0m and 5.4m viewers.  Burn Notice is a better comparison, as it was a summer debut and built up its audience to 4.8m, while White Collar was a Fall debut, which went in the opposite direction and closed the season with 4.0m viewers.  If there is a point here, it is that Graceland will likely need to hit at least the 4.0m mark to get a 2nd season.As for the show itself, outside of Vanessa Ferlito (Catherine ""Charlie"" Lopez, FBI agent), nobody really stood out in my eyes.  My hope that the show will stay away glamour shots and easily wrapped up cases.  Migrating instead to something like ""Dark Blue"" with a beach breeze.Stay tuned!",Positive
This is a great series. We just decided to check it out and glad we did. It has a good story line and it entertaining. Working on the second season right now.,Positive
"This was a great season, though it became very complicated in the final 2-3 episodes.The pace is fast and the characters never boring.  I love to watch Gabriel Macht more than any of the others.  His facial expressions are perfect and he never seems to be out of character.This show is perfect for young adults and over.  I am 70, so I catch many of the innuendos involving movies and TV shows of the past.  It is a smart, intelligently written show which does not degrade or lower the expectations of the viewer.",Positive
I thought it was a little slow.  If they pick up the pace a bit it could be a must see series. I definitely want more back ground on the suspected serial killer he kills at the beginning of the show.  I'm sure if this becomes a series it will come out during the trial.  Characters were pretty good. Titus Welliver plays his character very well. I'd be interested in watching more and see how this develops. I also want to him to catch the person responsible for killing the boy they found in the woods.  I suspect there's more then just one out there.  I have not read the books but I think I will now.,Positive
This is a great show and this was a great episode.  Even at 49 years old I still have to remind myself to never judge a book by it's cover.  When I saw the beginning I took the wife as a snobish rich wife and the husband as this rich mafia type.  I saw her walking with her little dog and bleached blonde hair and him in the cigar shop and I knew I would not like them.  Well once the show started I felt ashamed on how judgmental I was and how likable this family actually was.  The wife was very attractive and also very nice.  She was budget minded and seemed like she had a good heart.  The husband was also a very nice guy who worked hard for where he got and seemed like he appreciated all of it.  This family along with their three sons really impressed me and I'm glad I keep learning to never judge a book by its cover.  By the end I had a crush on the wife and wanted the husband as a best friend.,Positive
"Despite excellent production values, this show is boring. I wish the writers would channel Vince Gilligan (Breaking Bad) to liven things up.  For now, though, it's repetitive and dull, and lacks an interesting perspective.  The characters haven't developed in any complex ways, and the one who gave pleasure, Claudia (Margo Martindale), has been retired.  Maybe she wanted out of her contract!  I had high hopes for The Americans.  Why the raves?  Well, what can you expect when people quote &#34;Girls&#34; as if it were written by Oscar Wilde?  Maybe Fargo will be fun!",Negative
"This is one of the best tv shows on tv in my opinion. I love the addition of Sara Shahi she is awesome! But, I was disappointed that they killed off one of the main characters half way through the season.",Positive
"I really can not say how much I couldn't stand this movie. I'm sorry but I have grown weary of writers and directors who think that they can paint themselves as artists by making an incoherent movie with characters no one cares about that flows free form from one scene to the next in an attempt to be different. You're not different you're just bad.The basic premise here is Charles Swan III (portrayed by Charlie Sheen copying his performances from TWO AND A HALF MEN and ANGER MANAGEMENT) stars as a man in love with a woman who leaves him when she discovers he has a drawer filled with Polaroid pictures of past conquests. Why he feels the need to keep these around in such an open area who knows. Distraught at her leaving he attempts to drive after her, wrecks his car and ends up in the hospital.From here the movie goes every which way it can. It moves backward and forward in time, it moves into the surreal world of Charles's mind, it bring in characters just made for cameos and it goes nowhere fast. Some reviews of this film have called it genius and others have called it one of the worst films ever made. I tend to fall in the latter group.I found it difficult just to get through a large portion of this film let alone from beginning to end. I'll be the first to admit I never got there. Something inside of me said that there were better things in this world I could be doing than watching this piece of manure posing as art. Movies like this do little but make me angry when I read about other films that have lingered on shelves for years that sounded good but never got made. Then I realize that someone gave the people behind this movie money to make it and I think why this and not that?The film was written/directed by Roman Coppola who co-wrote THE DARJEELING LIMITED and MOONRISE KINGDOM with director Wes Anderson. I've never been a huge fan of Anderson for many of the reasons this film didn't work, but at least I've been entertained by them in one way or another. This movie feels like it was made by a fanboy of Anderson's who wanted to show he could make just as quirky a film. Instead it falls flat on its face offering a boring film that makes no sense and is difficult to watch let alone enjoy.Don't let the cover fool you. Names like Charlie Sheen, Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette and Jason Schwartzman may be listed in the credits but I could only believe they did this movie as a favor to Coppola. They would have done him a bigger favor by telling him that yes indeed; the king wasn't wearing any clothes.",Negative
"This tells the story of a smalltown boy who is the smartest kid in school and that makes him not only a &#8216;class A&#8217; nerd but also about as popular as a pork pie at a bar mitzvah.

He lives at home with an alcoholic mother who continually tells him she would be better off without him. His father ran out when he was a child and now only really contacts him when it is absolutely necessary, and it becomes necessary when he wants to remarry.He is desperate to escape and get to his ideal University so that he can one day become the top flight journo that he knows he can be. So in order to make his dreams come true he and fellow student Malerie Baggs (played by Rebel Wilson) decide to blackmail their fellow students to make the mag and literary review a success.This is a comedy and yes it is funny in places but this film has attracted criticism because of it baby faced singing star, Chris Colfer of &#8216;Glee&#8217; fame. He does not sing in any of this and fair play to him for broadening his artistic wings. He does a really good job without over stretching his tonsils and has proven he can do other things. Whilst not laugh out loud and no happy ending as we know he is dead from the opening scene )he gets struck by lightning), this is still a warm and rewarding watch.",Positive
"Our family liked season 1, where ordinary people had to find their way out of the wilds of Alaska. In season 2, the adventurers had to find their way of Venezuela. You would think that surviving in warm, tropical Venezuela would be easier than cold Alaska, but not so.

"I have loved this show from season one. Not so much the original English version (which I bought), but from series one with E. Wood. I think this show is hilarious but also sentimental and has family values. This is by far a very cheeky, weird type of show that is geared toward people who like this sort of funny, bizarre, animal loving sense of humor. Enjoy! I am sure you will get a lot of good laughs :)",Positive

Full face camera shots of his expressionless face don't frighten anyone.

"It still amazes me how little people prepare themselves for making what is probably the biggest investment in their lifetime. They worry about little things like the color of paint, or cleaning the carpet. One couple liked the look of ivy climbing up a cinder block wall which faced their back yard. It didn't bother them that the wall was part of the industrial building next door. They didn't stop to realize that the price of the house, which was lower than typical for that street, had a reason. The higher priced houses were farther down the street from the factory, Other people liked the furnishings, or other items in a house, which normally do not go with the sale of the house unless those items are in a separate personal property sale agreement. Finally, I don't know many people who purchase a house after looking at only three houses.  This program has too much repeating of names, locations, and other facts, and in general is a poorly made time filler.  When I was a sales person, if I made as many errors in a sales presentation as most of the agents in this program do I would have starved and quickly gone out of business.  Buyers don't care what a sales person likes as the term, &#34;I like...&#34; is used over and over again during the sales presentations. The buyers were also about as competent as the sales person as they lacked basic knowledge and common sense.",Negative

"The complicated life of Walt Longmire, the Sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming, gets even more complicated in Season Two of a terrific series.  However, Longmire, an old-fashioned lawman with heart and grit, will have nothing to do with quit.  The audience will be treated to some excellent television drama in thirteen episodes plus some special featurettes.  And the show returns all of an outstanding cast.Several narrative arcs dominate the season.  One is Walt's battle for re-election with his ambitious deputy Branch Connally, who will tempted more than once to bend the rules to win, until it threatens the life of the woman he loves.  A second is an ongoing police investigation in Denver, run by a ruthless and tireless detective, which will overshadow Walt and best friend Henry Standing Bear by season's end. A third arc involves a man from deputy Vic Moretti's past, a relentless stalker willing to play hardball.  Somewhat, Walt Longmire will have to find a way to keep solving crimes in his county despite all the distractions.The writers have done a great job with Season Two.  The characters get deeper and more interesting.  Even the Ferg, Walt's youngest deputy, gets some quality screentime. The storylines develop twists and turns, mixing modern crime with a certain unmistakable native spirituality.  Can't wait for Season Three; very highly recommended.",Positive
"Wonderful actors and characterizations.  Everyone nails their character so perfectly.  Glorious scenery, very tense story lines.  Another show I wish would go on for ever, but I wonder, when all the ends of this particular story line are tied up whether it will keep going.  I hope so.",Positive
"**Spoiler Alert. There may be spoilers here, so if you want to remain a Being Human ""virgin"", don't read below.It is a little tough watching the American version knowing that the BBC version is not only in its 3rd series, but the BBC version is more original simply for having set the stage for SYFY.Don't get me wrong, the American actors are fine and their performances are great, but the british cast ""own"" these roles. It's almost like the Americans are renting theirs. The BBC characters seem more fallible, more realisting, and belong to their roles. It is like the BBC wrote characters to best suit the actors, and in the SYFY version, they did the opposite, but to a somewhat disconcordant effect.That sounds more negative then it is intended, but I did not like the twist at the end of the American season when the werewolf Josh (played by Sam Huntington) is hoodwinked into sitting out the grande finale battle royale. Perhaps the SYFY ending was more fitting, as it felt truer to the logic of their universe.Case in point, a man of twenty-something has very little chance of outfoxing a man of 300 who is perpetually on his toes and a master of his powers (SYFY). What the BBC version suggested is that in the heat of combat both 150-something Mitchell (Aidan Turner) and Herrick [an ancient vampire with full acceptance (and thus, control) of his powers and senses; played by Jason Watkins], are duped by the silly, often-unwieldy George (played by Russel Tovey), one into making ready for a battle royale that will never happen, and the other getting locked in the basement with the werewolf. Herrick HAD to see that coming.In this BBC season-concluding episode, there is faithfulness to each performance and plot that is rarely seen in this type of horror/sci-fi drama.Oh, and Lenora Crichlow is a slamming hotty. Meaghan Rath seems a far more morose, whiny version of the ghostly-friend. I would rather spend eternity with a chipper Annie and her endless tea-making than Sally-sulks-a-lot, moping and pouting. That would drive me bonkers. If Sally doesn't cheer up in season 2 of SYFY, I'm not sure if I can stomach it.Kristen Hager has better looks than Sinead Keenan. That's all I have to say on that matter. It feels like each series picked the correct actress to play across from their dopey werewolf roomie. Still, Nina seems a little more realistic in the role because she's not physically perfect. She is charming, and has a flair for the character. Kristen is believable as a young doctor in Boston, although I can't quite place why her character would hang around with Josh. I think given their dispositions, the only thing keeping these two characters together is the script.",Positive

"A gray and dystopic future, evil megacorp taking over the world and the people in it - OK, that part's been done. 'Metropia' stands out for doing it brilliantly. It's a lot more than that, though.Animation has explored the super-realistic, with just enough success that the discrepancies become especially jarring. This goes farther, well into the surreal. That allows for exaggerations of faces and figures, wide-eyed blankness and evil scowls that wouldn't be phyiscally possible for human actors. And, despite great advances in computer-aided post-production, animators can build their worlds from the ground up in the image they want, with no need to retrofit them into scraps of reality. This movie really does use animation in a novel and very distinctive way.Very enjoyable in many ways. Certainly not one for the kiddies, it scarcely qualifies as as ""adult"" movie - but body-shy viewers might have trouble with brief- and semi-nudity.-- wiredweird",Positive
"I like this sort of movie, so for me all that was missing was some popcorn.  I thought some of the actors were very good.  The movie changes venues a few times, so that kept it from getting boring, (we get to spend the evening at a bar in a long intermission from ghost hunting during the middle) and it lacked the annoying screaming that ruins so many movies and tv shows for me.  The ending was a bit surprising, although overall it wasn't really a super scary movie, and I scare easy. Not much in the way of graphic violence either, which I also liked about it.  It was a bit like watching a Paranormal State episode or something.  Some of the music was pretty good.  Bring popcorn and a sense of humor. ;)",Positive

"This show gave me a modern view of shows made over a similar material. As a teen, I watched China Beach and as an adult Combat Hospital. I love the way they delivered it as though you could be on base. My only disappointment is that there isn't any seasons beyond the first. So the lacking star in my review is not for those that worked on the show but those executives that shorted the viewers.",Positive
"I really like the show and feel its unique style stands out as one of the better 'supernatural' shows around.  However, this season still  needed some work.  The performances were good but the editing was a bit choppy.  Some of the points of the the plots were almost lost or a little off in consistency.  But in the end of Part 1 of Season 3 the pulled it off.  :)",Positive
"Screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's big-screen collaborations with director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu have produced a trio of highly accomplished films -Amores Perros,21 Grams, andBabel- that juxtaposed several storylines, all tied together by characters who were damaged souls in search of redemption and connection with one another. Although the two had a very public falling-out, Arriaga still appears to be strongly influenced by his former partner's jumbled filmmaking style as he takes over the director's chair with this 2009 drama. The chief problem, however, is that Arriaga doesn't really show I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's passion and audacity as he attempts to pull off the considerable demands of a non-linear narrative with conviction. Moreover, Arriaga the screenwriter lets down Arriaga the director with a script that ultimately feels too predictable and contrived despite strong performances from the cast.There looks to be four separate stories at the outset, which eventually transitions into two. The first involves Sylvia, the manager of an upscale, seaside restaurant in Portland, an extremely pained woman who prefers casual sex followed by self-inflicted punishment. She is obviously anguished over something that motivates her erratic behavior. The second thread takes place in New Mexico near the Mexican border where Gina, an unhappily married mother of four, is carrying on an affair with a local man named Nick, also married with children. The complication here is that her daughter Mariana finds out about the affair and embarks on a relationship with Nick's son Santiago. Meanwhile, in Mexico, a crop-duster plane crash-lands on an open field, as his twelve-year-old daughter Maria watches in horror.Arriaga's fractured approach works for a little while albeit in an emotionally draining, humorless way. However, when the moment of revelation arrives (and much too early), the plot unravels into a Lifetime TV-movie level of sanctimony obscured by the fiery explosion that gives the movie its name. Proving yet again that a beautiful woman can convincingly expose the torment of a soul under fire, Charlize Theron successfully makes the nihilistic Sylvia an ultimately sympathetic figure. Kim Basinger, looking entirely too stunning and wrinkle-free at 55 to be a K-Mart-shopping housewife, manages to get to the heart of a guilt-ridden woman, even as she shows Gina going through the predictable machinations of her illicit actions.The stand-out performance, however, comes from Jennifer Lawrence, a Jewel look-alike, as the troubled teen Mariana, the dramatic pivot for the whole movie. Tessa Ia makes a strong impression as the pensive Maria, while the men barely make a ripple - John Corbett as a smitten sous-chef in Sylvia's restaurant, Joaquim de Almeida as the passionate Nick, Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Yazpik as the go-between Carlos, and Danny Pino as the pilot. The one exception is J.D. Pardo who plays Santiago as the impetuous Romeo to Lawrence's Juliet. Robin Tunney shows up in a smallish role as Sylvia's one true friend. Robert Elswit and John Toll share cinematography responsibilities here, and they do an excellent job capturing all the locales. At the end of the movie, I couldn't help thinking that Arriaga's yin was fundamentally missing I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's yang.",Negative

I know Lamont  is not the only black cast member, but so far his character has been the most visible and most vocal. I hope that we get to learn more about the other team members in later episodes. I also hope to see more of Coach Paysinger (Billy Dee Williams is still the man!) Oh, and I literally laughed out loud at the ""Fame"" reference during Massella's (sp?) dance lesson.Overall, cool show. Just keep in mind that not all black people come from broken homes or underprivileged backgrounds. I know that's a very common narrative in the media, but our socioeconomic backgrounds are just as varied as any other racial group. Even so, being raised in a broken home or coming from an underprivileged background is not always a precursor to maladjusted behavior.At any rate, I think the show is very entertaining when it's not being insulting.",Positive

"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:Quotation credit to Charles Bowden, Author of ""Murder City: Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez and the Global Economy's New Killing Fields"".Highly hyped by FX, looking to catch lightening in a bottle a la ""Sons of Anarchy"".  There is a little here for everyone:A gruesome murder (w/mixed Mexican-American body parts)Drug cartelsPretty girls in short skirtsAttractive blonde American detective with AspergerA Mexican detective that is seemingly not corruptTech savvyThree storylines/mysteries which may at some point intersectThe potential for back stories galoreA lot to take in within the first 90-minutes (including commercials).  A virtual assault on the senses!  There is the main storyline of a body straddling the ""Bridge of Americas"".  The body is that of a female.  Make that females with the upper half comprised of a hard line anti-Mexican American Judge and the lower half that of one Juarez's missing girls.  How the perpetrator was actually able to shut down all of the video cameras at the border in order to place the body just so, is where we are perhaps first being asked to suspend reason (presumably, the same tech savvy individual that co-opted the electronic locking mechanism, thus trapping the Reporter played by Mathew Liliard in his car).  The other 2-storylines involve a quasi kidnapping of a Mexican prostitute and Annabeth Gish (a long way from Mystic Pizza) as recently widowed wife of a wealthy rancher who had some secrets of his own after making a death bed confession that he didn't love her anymore.This is serious fare that will require a commitment to watch, as the proverbial onion is peeled layer by layer.It is a little early to comment on all the performances, though Diane Kruger already shows great potential as the American Detective Sonya Cross, afflicted with AspergerOne more thought re: the criticism when compared to the original Danish/Swedish series.  There are more than a few shows currently on US TV that were copied or influenced by programs from other countries.  So what!  I have not watched the original, though plan to at some point and will offer a review as to which I liked better.  Hopefully. the US version will be a tribute to the original and not a carbon copy of the original script (see the US version of the Inbetweeners).",Positive

"This spy thriller makes you think. The reason it didn't last more than one season was probably due to that fact - people want their entertainment simiple and fitting a formula. This show deviates from the expected, leaving you wondering just who is doing what and why are they doing it. And the characters are not your usual mix. They are all slightly off so that sometimes you wonder if API is more of an insane asylum than a spy shop. The pace is a bit slow, but, in my mind, necessary for the plot development. This show and the actors deserved more than one season.",Positive
Unique and original series.  the cast is excellent and the writing worthy of an award.  hooked after the first two episodes!,Positive

"In ""Awake"", L.A. police detective Michael Britten survives a terrible car accident to live in a bifurcated world, one in which his wife survived the accident, the other in which his son survives.  Every time Michael goes to sleep, he finds himself in the other reality.  He is under psychiatric counseling in each reality.  Amusingly, his respective shrinks insist the reality is a dream.The season only lasted thirteen episodes, which was far too little to enjoy Michael working his way through cases that seemed to overlap between his realities; clues from one helped solve crimes in the other, baffling his two different partners.  Viewers would learn that Michael's accident wasn't what it seemed to be.  He was the target, or the victim, of a conspiracy whose true dimensions were unclear until nearly the end of the season.  At the end, Michael's dogged pursuit of the truth risked both death and madness.""Awake"" sustained a complicated plot; the final episodes of the season were a masterpiece of misdirection and paranoia, as Michael's two worlds began to collide.

"When Season One of ""The Killing"" premiered on AMC, it was an instant critical darling. An adaptation of a successful Danish television series, it was an intense and quiet show with a slow build drama that got under your skin. Those eager for easy answers and constant action might have needed to look elsewhere because the pace of ""The Killing"" was more akin to the unraveling of a fine novel than to that of a breakneck thriller. In the premiere episode, a young girl named Rosie Larsen was found murdered. Each episode represented one day following three distinct story threads. We saw the investigation progress, we examined the painful aftermath on the girl's family and friends, and we reflected on how the murder might be tied to local politicians and bigwigs. But despite its critical praise, which included six EMMY nominations (including Lead Actress Mireille Enos and Supporting Actress Michelle Forbes), the first season ended on a note of controversy. Fans felt betrayed that all of the answers into the mystery were not revealed and their vitriol was quite vocal! (Strangely enough, the show was canceled and then uncanceled and Season Three is currently on TV).Season Two, consisting of another 13 episodes, picks up directly where the first season concluded. Enos and her partner (an invaluable Joel Kinnaman) are now at odds after the season finale revelations. If anything, though, she is even more obsessed with finding the truth. As she doggedly pursues the investigation, it alienates her further from the department. Mayoral candidate Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) is facing a new set of obstacles, also due to the events of last season. Seemingly out of the race, he will prove that he still has the stuff to be a major political player in the city. And the Larsen clan is in tatters, with mother (Forbes) on a spiritual sojourn and father (Brent Sexton) left to hold the family together. The three plot strands will weave in and out of one another as Enos follows the leads. Was Rosie a call girl? Is her death related to the suspicious activities of a local Indian casino? Was there a political motivation for her demise? Or was it something closer to home? This time, all will be revealed.""The Killing"" continues to take its time, and the case takes a number of false turns before arriving at its final destination. There certainly are a lot of nefarious and unscrupulous characters in the Seattle area! Truthfully, I don't disagree that two seasons for this one case seemed to stretch the limits of what was necessary. But there are some tense and memorable moments throughout these episodes. I'm glad I stuck around for Season Two. In addition to smart scripts, the cast is absolutely first rate. Enos is fortitude personified, Kinnaman gives a star-making performance, Campbell is surprisingly strong, and Sexton is a powerhouse. I also liked that supporting players Kristin Lehman and Eric Ladin (as Campbell's staff) really come into their own. Perhaps the show's most unorthodox choice, however, is with Forbes. Continuing to explore the stages of grief, this tremendous performance is sidelined from the rest of the principle cast for most of the season. It's a bold choice, but I could watch Forbes all day! ""The Killing"" is an adult entertainment that requires patience and rewards it. If you enjoyed the first season despite its inconclusiveness, I really recommend Season Two. KGHarris, 3/13.",Positive
"My husband and I have been riveted to the Killing. It's basically a whodunit, but very well done. Great atmospherics of Seattle, dark & rainy.

Just good old evil. :-)",Positive

"Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction.  When they released ""Pawn Stars: Volume Three,"" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety.  It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes.  When they released ""American Pickers: Volume Two,"" it was the same thing.  Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two.  I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases.  Personally, I didn't agree with the decision--but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included.  Anyone who read the box knew what to expect--how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Not so for ""American Restoration, Volume One!""  I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside.  Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package)--it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting.  I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics?  I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information.  My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base.  I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!I, however, will tell you what is inside.  The 2 DVD set has sixteen episodes:  all four from the abbreviated Season One and the first twelve from Season Two.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were sixteen episodes on the DVD box?Season One: (1) Hopalong Rock, (2) Ice Cold, (3) Lights Out, and (4) Buttered Up.Season Two: (1) Cooler Kings, (2) Knockout, (3) Duck and Cover, (4)Pumped Up, (5) Space Kowboy, (6) Jackpot, (7) Safe Keeping, (8) Suck Up, (9) Rev'd Up, (10) Apples and X-Rays, (11) Hot & Cold, and (12) Secret Fan.Actual Review:I will be brief in my actual review since I already went on a tirade.  ""American Restoration"" is an offshoot of the popular ""Pawn Stars,"" and fits comfortably into the History Channel's stable of reality based programming.  Its star (Rick Dale) made semi-regular appearances on that program, but now we get a closer look at what he does.  Based in Las Vegas, Dale and team locate objects that might be of value (or represent lost bits of Americana) and figure out ways to restore the item to its former glory.  It's an easy show to like and fascinating especially if you enjoy antiquing or modern day treasure hunting shows (Pawn Stars, Storage Wars and others).  I found it very interesting to see the different techniques of this unusual art form--and I do think Dale is an artist!  The program itself merits four stars.  KGHarris, 11/11.",Negative
"im a late comer in most shows. but im not  wealthy so for entertainment i watch tv, and movies. and im old enough to have watched a lot over the years. there are a few key components for the making of hit show. the writing of course has to be good. but what has come with it, and this is every bit as important as the writing itself, maybe more so. and that is the people chosen to play the characters. if you look at almost any show, even sitcoms, it is the chemistry between  people that makes us drawn to the show. for example, i believe we all love the idea of friendship and find it hard to find even one person that you can fully trust and call friend through out life. shows that were hits all had good writing, sometimes not, but had people playing the characters that were really good at bringing the friendship and trust to the screen. look at happy days, lavern and shirley, seinfeld, cheers, mash, house, bones, friends, and finally nypd blue. these are only a few examples. what do they all have in common? the relationships between any two people, or in the case of friends many friendships between many people. i love nypd blue, and although the writer had a drinking problem and it did affect his writing, the people carried the show because they were so good at bringing the characters such as sipowitz and john kelley, or bobby simone. the friendships that sipowitz had over the years on that show i believe is what really draws us in. in my case, when watching i have found myself searching in my own mind the question, do i have that kind of friendship? and wanting to watch and see how they look out for one another and without almost never saying it, you know they care about each other like family. i think that is the key to any drama or sitcom for that matter. having the right actors, and their ability to bring that level of emotion and caring for each other that we all look for in our own lives. an example of this can be found in house. before the writers strike with house, it was a hit show, and winning awards. why? hugh laurie or house and his relationship with wilson, his best friend, and cuddy. then you have the supporting cast of cameron, chase, and forman. but its the relationship between house and wilson that really brings us closer and gives us the laughs we enjoy by watching, and relate to in our own lives. its the friendship, and the flirtation with cuddy, and how he interacts with his supporting cast that we have come to love. BUT, if you look at when they broke up the crew, the writers strike happend, chase, cameron, and forman had next to no time with house. also, they took away the witty exchange with wilson and cuddy. the dynamic of the show changed. the ratings dropped, people wrote and called in their fustration with the direction the show was taking. the writers essentially ruined the chemistry between the key characters. the friendships and relationships that we all related to, or hoped for in our own lives was no longer there. ratings dont lie. so, my long way of making my point is this: the show ""lie to me"" is very unique. first the writing is good. not great. i think they can improve and have a lot of material to draw off of. but the people who play the characters really make that show a hit. from day one, they have been developing the friendships and relationships between the characters and i believe as long as they keep moving in this direction it will be a great hit. the concept and or idea of the show is very unique. nothing like it before has ever hit the small screen. making my point in friendship, they even brought in the actor from ER to be like a second partner, but male not female, and you can see how they are becoming better friends and learning to trust each other.  forgive me i cant remember his name at the moment, but the lead character lightman now has a FBI guy to lean on, and you can see they felt they needed him to have that connection like they did on nypd blue. lightman has the one woman he trusts, but they oscillate between flirtation and friendship. with the FBI its two guys depending on each other. partners like you would find in any police unit. and i believe they give us all the components for a great tv series. the friendship, a unique concept in telling the truth, and the story lines in which to bring out all the things we can relate to in our own lives. plus its damn funny too. its a great cast, great idea in terms of what lightman does, and i believe if the writers keep moving forward, keep the characters growing letting us in a little at a time, and bring that friendship to the front with his FBI agent it will be on for many years to come. i love the show and plan on buying the series. five stars from me. but then im just a guy with a little too much time on my hands.",Positive
"I've been a fan since the beginning, when the cast was slim, yet with enough of the critical elements - a hot chick, a funny guy, the old cratchety guy and enough of an ensemble to carry a great sci-fi premise. As with so many shows that succeed, they add added a really great layer of characters in this latest season. So much so, that it is a darn shame the whole thing is slated to end in a shortened final season. I contend that the unending potential of the premise is enough to go several additional seasons, and perhaps seed a new cast or spinoff. Too darn bad. Why take chances on completely new and crappy shows when this one rocks?",Positive
"Awesome show, cannot wait for Season 2.",Positive
"I loved Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under so I was excited when he chose to do another cable TV show.  This show turned out to be even better than Six Feet Under.  Michael C. Hall plays a serial killer who kills only bad people.  This creates a moral ambiguity that the show plays up nicely.  Is Dexter a good or bad person?  How do we really feel about him?  How does he really feel about himself?  At the time we are exploring the story, Dexter is evolving from a character who states he lacks human feeling to someone who seems to feel more and more with each passing day (or episode).  The show is brilliantly done.  I've read the book and it is a pretty straight forward story.  To build the story up, the writers of the show build up the characters and made them even deeper characters.  I am just so impressed with the work.  They can even make me angry because I'm so involved and one of my major characters is affected in some way.  I am attracted to Dexter and repelled by him at the same time.",Positive
I love this show it comes from a totally new perspective of ghost hunting. They seem to be empathetic to the problem  clients face on a daily basis instead of sensstionalising and preying upon what seems to be terrible things that are happening to people.,Positive
"Can't wait till the next episode.  Loved the story line and the characters.  So far only the pilot, but it was sci fy at its best.",Positive
"What a beginning! Dialog, acting...everything is well done. The whole subject treated with respect and truth.  The characters and issues introduced in the first episode will be interesting to watch unfold.. It always cracks me up to read a review from someone who makes a conclusion about a show while saying they only saw 5 minutes. Like speed dating! In all fairness, sometimes a person is just in the mood for something different, but that shouldn't be the basis for a review. Boy, I recall watching a four hour long special in the 80's.  It was a complete showing of AIDS, myths, facts, all of it. And I remember being completely overwhelmed and frightened as  I realized that, regardless of my own careful love life, I had no knowledge or control over the multitude of ladies my boyfriend had been with, or who the multitude had been with. Extrapolating from what few historical facts I did know was overwhelmingly scary.  It didn't matter what gender or preference one was, it was just a huge nightmare for all of us over which one had no control at all.  I think a lot of credit goes to the researchers who worked hard to find treatments and the brave souls who took those unproven treatments in clinical trials in the hope that, in the least, it would bring us closer to cure or prevention.  And this series deserves respect for being real rather than simply treating the subject as pure entertainment. I guess it was entertaining education of mind, heart and soul. Good Job!",Positive
"Just a bad show overall. I tried to like it, but a lot about the show was just off. VERY off. I could suspend belief and understand that the family was deep undercover. However, once you look deeper, you will see how poorly constructed the plot is. It's a color-by-numbers ripoff of the Breaking Bad and Shield formula, except it's not about meth or crooked cops. These so-called undercover spies operate like the mafia. All of it is ridiculously transparent, plus guess what, the FBI agent on the lookout for guys like them lives next door!!!I find it hard to believe anyone could possibly enjoy this show!",Negative
"I must say, i really didnt care for the main antagonist, whom i wont reveal here. Lets just say that there is no way that person defeats a warrior with superior training and experience in single combat. At least, i dont see it truly happening. The person in question repeatedly kicks a bit more ass than you figure could really happen. That part was pure Hollywood.However, the story itself was pretty cool. Essentially, the Ninth Legion gets wiped out and the seven survivors try to first, rescue their general, and then make their way out of enemy territory, which they find themselves pretty deep into. The primary protagonist is a fully honorable soldier, but some of his companions are arguably less so. However, since their survival is tied to one another, they have to get along. The really cool aspect of the story in my opinion is the depiction of them basically jogging/running everywhere. Want to get somewhere in the olden days and you dont have a horse, you gotta run. That really stuck with me as a very good plot device as well as exhibiting quite a bit of realism.You will have recognized a few of the actors elsewhere, but the most recognizable were the boyfriend from the first two seasons of Dr Who, and Dominic West.Anyway, i will refrain from describing too much else about the movie, but it is an overall enjoyable experience.",Positive
"A great binge watcher and one hell of a story. Emotion packed stories, powerful acting, worthy directing and plots that deserve your attention. You will always be left wanting more, and when you get it, you won't be disappointed. Why can't all dramas be this good?!!!!",Positive
Hard for me to watch.  I view it when I need motivation to clean my own house and throw stuff out.  How can anyone care so much about &#8220;stuff?&#8221;  They put &#8220;things&#8221; over people and that is the most disturbing part.,Negative
"You know the plot. Trashy kids being trashy. The &#34;good&#34; ones are the &#34;poor&#34; ones. The rich trashy kids are just &#34;bad&#34;. Another movie to help the retarded careers of this TV show's actors. They are all old and washed out. But they still try to be hip and cool with their texting and foul mouths, sex videos. Sorry if you can't route for the heroine of the movie it clearly isn't worth watching.",Negative
LOVE...Why have we not seen Madeleine Stowe on TV before??  She is amazing...she and Gabriel Mann steal the show every week.,Positive
"Video; acting; storyline; script all of  a quality of a high school film class student production. Just goes to show that anyone with $500 for an HD camera can produce a waste of time video. No humor unless, again high school crude was the high light of your education; no story other than three weeks (boringly noted with day 1. day 2, etc. superimposed) of a few people in a house just drinking, talking and acting stupid. The only ghostly thing was the usual door opening/closing and a bed sheet raising (someone was under it and it was suppose to be a ghost) - that's it.All the five stars are probably connected to the video.",Negative
"We've been watching this for quite some time.  The program is somewhat entertaining, though I've begun disliking it due to a few particular actors who display less than desirable character traits.",Negative
"Great series, too bad there isn't a season 3 set to buy as well. Get this series you won't be disappointed.",Positive
"I love Good Eats and always thought it was one of the best cooking shows out there...period! It's entertaining, extremely informative, light hearted, and Alton Brown really does make you feel you can be a real chef, especially with his workaround for things that the household cook doesn't have access to.",Positive
"if you got the two Fallout 3 references at the end. So there's nothing new under the sun, right? Although I found myself quoting TV shows and movies more than once for clich&eacute;d dialog. Two in particular, ""If money is all you love, then that's what you'll receive."" Princess Leia to Han Solo as he's about to selfishly ride away when they really need his help. And, ""I knew there was more to you than money!"" Also, Leia and Han. The cool twist (SPOILERS) is it's his daughter who rides back into town with help.Nolan's hero journey is solidly grounded and he's surrounded by a good cast of metaphorical characters to play off. I especially like the sisters. One is the blond, beautiful and kind of innocent mayor and the other is the dark, sultry, definitely not innocent owner (and we are pretty sure Nolan won't have to pay for her services much longer) of the local whorehouse.So, plenty of stories to tell, with plenty of interesting characters play them out. Thank you writers for not hammering us with adolescent angst. Good balance of youth and adult story lines. Did you get the reference the mayor made, with the comment about keeping the trains running? Foreshadowing do you think?From Wikipedia: 'Fascism was really the basis for the New Deal. It was Mussolini's success in Italy, with his government-directed economy, that led the early New Dealers to say 'But Mussolini keeps the trains running on time'Fascism? In Defiance?Although, this show could easily get mired in clich&eacute;s it manages to avoid the fall with the dashing bad-boy with a heart of gold (and a killer smile. we will never tire of that crooked smirk on a handsome face) and his kick-ass adopted daughter. Redemption, racism, love, the consequences of war and peace, parental love, young love, adult relationships. It's all here. I'm settling in for the long haul.",Positive
"When we last saw Don Draper (Jon Hamm), he was in complete meltdown mode in the pitch to Hershey, spilling the beans on his checkered past.  As the Seventh Season opens, Don is on leave from the agency that he helped build, trying to put together the pieces of his life and figure out the next step.&#34;Mad Men&#34; is always at his best when it uses Draper as the central focus and have all the other characters working around him.  In short, that is why these seven episodes work so well.  All the other cast of characters are use superbly, but Don is at the center of everything.In terms of balance, these seven episodes are some of the best in show history.  I won't go into the details here, but I got the distinct sense that no one gets the short shrift here.  It truly is a testament to the writing of this show that they can have such a large ensemble cast and yet make every character interesting and always moving forward.The decision to break this final season into two seven-episode seasons?  I don't like that one bit.  I realize that AMC did not want to lose Breaking Bad AND Mad Men in consecutive seasons, but come on....seven episodes and then wait a year?!  Just when things were getting into high gear, all of a sudden it is back to holding again.Overall, though, the first half of season seven is vintage Mad Men.  By this point, the characters are so good and ingrained that even questionable choices (a Bert Cooper musical number?!) can be disregarded in favor of the overall narrative.  I hate waiting so long to see how all of this will play out, but I sure will be excited when that time finally does roll around again.",Positive
I liked the characters just when there story lines were being developed the show endedApparently superhero shows can't magically keep there audience coming back each week,Positive
"Not a fan of Gere but this story wasn't too bad. Had some good twists on what could have been a rehashed, tired storyline. The language was way over the top though.",Negative
"I enjoyed this short lived series but if is forgettable. I follows a well worn and used theme and structure. Butiful, competent, flawed wonan getting to the top teamed with a maverick detective fighting crime. The good guys win.",Negative
"Law and Order LA Rocks! Unique ideas, excellent characters, top-notch acting. Law and Order LA Rocks! Two thumbs up! Word!",Positive
"This really was a series that was somewhat dangerous to make, because of how iconic Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the character Hannibal Lector has become, it is hard to imagine anyone else in that role (even though others have played it).  That said Mads Mikkelsen does a great job making the character his own, and while playing it differently than Hopkins, staying true to the character.  For example his portrayal of Lector is somewhat more reserved and less snarky than Hopkins played him.  That is most likely due to the fact that he is still the hidden monster at this point in the story, and still a well respected member of society.  He is still very much the master manipulator however.The TV show is set about 4 years before the events in Red Dragon.  Only the audience knows who Lecter really is (and what he is really serving for dinner), which actually makes watching the events unfold very exciting.  There is always an element of will he be found out that goes on in almost every episode. The series actually revolves as much (if not more so) around the character of Will Graham (played by Hugh Dancy), who is in this version an empathic who can get in the minds of a killer and see how the victims are killed.  Jack Crawford (played by Laurence Fishburne) brings Graham in as a to profile serial killers.  He is shown as very gifted but mentally unstable, and Lecter (who is almost an ancillary character in the first couple episodes) is his psychiatrist and is committing some of the murders being investigated.The series has a lot going for it.  Great acting, writing and special effects are at the top of the list.  The special effects are so good in fact that if you have a weak stomach you may not want to watch after eating because there are some very gory death scenes.  They are as gory as anything you see on a lot of cable shows.  It really is a show that you have to watch from the beginning because there are a lot of story arcs that carry throughout the season.  Some of the episodes have a ""story of the week"" flavor to them, but there are a couple story lines that keep coming back over and over.As far as the blu ray set, the series looks and sounds great.  Thankfully it plays in a season mode that allows you to pick up where you left off if you stop it.  There are a lot of special features including extended episodes, commentary on selected episodes, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a few making of/behind the scenes featurettes.  In all there is a lot there for those who like bonus material.  If you are a fan of the books and/or movies, this definitely does them justice and is worth checking out.",Positive
Love this show!!!  The chemistry of the characters is good and the emotion is realistic and intense.  It is Very entertaining!!,Positive
"I really wasn't pulled into this show. It took far too long to set up the story and the only reason I didn't turn away was because I enjoy supporting Amazon Prime Pilot season and giving my feedback. Plus, I was too lazy to go searching for something else to watch. The characters were OK, but I found some of them way too cliched. Like the Mr. Ireland character who drank and cursed like a sailor. How original? I wasn't sure why the main actress was French either, seeing as it's set in the US and doesn't add anything to the show. The stronger leads were the established actors like Sharon Lawrence, Aldis Hodge and, surprisingly, Jamie Kennedy. There were things about the story that made no sense like the loss of time from when they entered the elevator to when they escaped. Why the hotel security guy was able to be paid off for taking the French actress up to her hotel room? If it's really the end of the world, what good is money? Also, why was no one allowed up to their hotel room, and all the floors were empty but the lobby was overrun with guests coming and going? Where were they coming from? Little details like that really bother me. Anyway, back to the concept of the show. I'm not sure what the concept is to be honest. It's not clearly spelled out in the pilot what is happening, or what the goal is of all these characters thrown together. Are they going to be living in that huge mansion together, or off in the woods? How will they survive? Is this an alien invasion or terrorism? Either way, I simply don't care. And that's the sad part! I don't really care enough about these characters to tune back in. I've seen far better shows over the years that have successfully set up their concept and established likeable characters from the beginning with a mix of action, suspense, comedy, and drama, such as: Sliders, Torchwood, The X-Files, Eureka, and Supernatural to name a few; so I'm not interested in wasting my time here. This was a dud to me.",Negative
I could care about the characters of the show and that's what usually makes me want to watch. I am also not familiar with any of the actors but it really didn't matter. So we have geeks trying to make it in the start up world of smart phone apps but specifically they are trying to market their social app. I thought it was funny and would be curious how the show's characters progress. Hope this one makes it!,Positive
"With the 2010-2011 television season wrapping up, it is official that the promising ""The Chicago Code"" will not be back for a sophomore year. An intriguing, if not wholly successful, cop show--I will say this one scored huge points for not being a typical procedural tackling a new case each week. Created by Shawn Ryan, the show excelled at depicting the political struggles and manipulations inherent in a government bureaucracy even if it didn't always ring true with its supporting characters and peripheral story lines. But at heart, the show's strengths far outweighed its shortcomings. I came into ""The Chicago Code"" with pretty hefty expectations, I must admit. Ryan created, in my opinion, TV's greatest police drama ""The Shield"" as well as the under appreciated and quirky ""Terriers."" Both of those shows, however, benefited from being on FX--a network that is able to provide edgier and more realistic fare than traditional networks (this aired on Fox). In most respects, you can see the distinct difference.The show centers around the appointment of a new police commissioner (Jennifer Beals) who vows to tackle corruption and complacency within the Chicago department. Aided by a former colleague and hotshot cop, Jason Clarke, the pair take on cases of particular political volatility. One of their primary targets is a potentially corrupt city alderman played with precision by Delroy Lindo. It is this continuing story line that gives ""The Chicago Code"" its greatest drama and intrigue.The Good: Clarke, a great actor who has been restrained in previous roles, has a chance to really break out here. Beals is an intriguingly complex character. And Lindo, as I mentioned, is riveting. He steals every scene he's in. The action revolving around his plot lines is dynamic and mesmerizing.The Bad: As great as the central characters are, the show falters a bit with its supporting cast. Clarke's niece is also on the force and having a dalliance with her partner. In one episode, this secret relationship is exposed causing a settlement suit to be awarded to a complainant. However, somehow the affair still remains a secret after becoming a part of public record. Huh? And there is an undercover cop in the Irish mob. He's a low level hood that somehow ascends to exactly the position he needs to be in. Very convenient and not at all plausible. Add the fact that he is constantly in contact with Beals and Clarke (even in public venues) and deep undercover has never seemed so shallow. The actors are all fine, the screenplay is just taking unnecessary shortcuts that undermine the show's truthfulness.The Perplexing: This being a network show, Ryan doesn't have the luxury of using realistically colorful language. He, therefore, makes Clarke a character who is offended by the use of curse words (especially in front of children). Okay, I'll buy it--except for one thing. He just substitutes euphemisms for swear words that sound just like swear words. If he were really offended by bad language, his vocabulary would reflect that--he wouldn't just make up new words.All in all, though, I enjoyed the show and think it might have developed into a richer and more rewarding experience. But we'll never know. For Beals, Clarke, and Lindo--this is still an easy recommendation. I'll follow Ryan to his next show (back on cable, I hope) and maybe that one can make it past one season (the great Terriers also didn't get a second season pick-up). If you like cop shows, you'll probably like this one too. KGHarris, 5/11.",Positive
"I really enjoyed this first season with the Arrow closely paralling the old &#34;Green Arrow&#34;.  It is well filmed and the cast all play their parts excellently.  You are constantly kept guessing as to what will happen and just when you think you have it, a new twist is revealed.  Looking forward to Season 2.",Positive
"Stargate Universe has a fine cast and fine acting.  The first season portrays the blowup of a planet and the hurried departure of an ancient starship from said planet with scientists and visitors aboard, and the troubles attendant on the Destiny because it has apparently been travelling a long time without any crew and therefore without any maintenance. Various solutions are found but there are also conflicts among the people aboard, since some are scientists, some military and some just folks.  It is a good beginning to the four-season journey.Linda Sheean",Positive
"This series is new so it suffers from what many new shows suffer from, just not being quite as polished as it could be. But I did enjoy it and am looking forward to new seasons. If you like Face Off this is a similar show and if you like Jim Henson's stuff (you're a bad person if you don't) then this show will bring you pleasure. It will get better with future seasons to be sure.",Positive
I can't stop watching this show. Just when you think you know what's going on there's some insane twist that has literally made me jump out of my chair and yell &#34;WHAT?!&#34;. I love it.,Positive
"I wish they would have finished the season, kind of a let down. I am going to buy the books though. I hope the money goes to the author and not the short visioned dweebs who dropped the series!",Positive
"Bravo for being true to who you are not PC, not crude, not Hollywood.It's mass media for the masses?

"I didn't hate this one, don't get me wrong, it's still miles from being good, but the lead character has potential. Nice to see Malcolm McDowell and Bernadette Peters acting, and though I'm not a huge fan of Saffron Burrows, there was just enough of her without triggering the usual boredom sensation I get when she's on screen. Everyone else was meh, except the new conductor who was a one dimensional black hole of comedy. If this gets picked up, consider revising the character.",Negative
"I watched ""Breaking Bad"" as I have started so many other ""premium"" series, like ""The Wire"", ""Game Of Thrones"" and others because I first heard about it on PBS.  Thinking there was some ""literacy"" and seriousness to it I watched the first season which by the time I got around to it was free on NetFlix I think it was.It's clever and interesting and engrossing and I have watched all the series up to this point ... end of season 5 and contemplating purchasing season 6, the last season.As I look back on it I find most of what I watched I watched because the spectacle and craziness.  Like a car crash it's hard to take one's eyes away and one wants to know what is going to happen next and keep up with what other people you know see.The problem with this series though is that any statement about morality, drug-dealing, violence, crime, ""breaking-bad"" is really non-existent or useless, because just the sensational parts of the show are shown.  We don't see any of the fallout, or more accurately we do not really see the results of Meth on the people and the families of Walt's users.  We get to see some pretty fancy ""mafia-like"" footwork as in ""The Godfather"" in assassinations and murders, set to music and choreographed like a dance.We see the innocent and guilty affected by this, and the domination and abuse of Walt's wife Skylar who has no choice but to sit it out and wait to see what happens.  We don't actually see what would really be happening to Skylar if she was real, how she would prematurely age and start to get sick from the stress of her life and the lies she has to live and the threats from her husband who was until this thing started apparently her sole support system.In short, the show is completely sensational, has no literary or artistic aspect to it ... in my humble opinion.  It is spectacle.  So after all this time I suppose I will see the last season ... although I thought they told me last season was the last season and now I have to buy another one.  I suppose this will either follow the pattern of most series and Walt will get his comeuppance which always seems funny to me that we see all this gratuitous violence and crime for 5 seasons, and then in very end of the last season the anti-hero gets his punishment - OR - we will get something like the Sopranos, Walt does more bad stuff and his life goes on.I have to summarize that this program is just another violent television series that is just something to watch.  It will fade into the past like the Godfather or the Sopranos all this talk will be forgotten.  So, I'd say 3/5 ... it's entertaining.  If you have not watched it, I'd say think about it and whether you want to fill your brain with this nonsense, if not, you're not missing much.  If so, you're not getting much - but entertainment.  That's OK if that's what you want.I'd rather have gotten the whole series for free now that I have watched it in order to not be sending money to such enterprises.  Kind of sorry I have spent money on it.*** Since everyone is voting me as unhelpful, which is interesting because I have the longest and most detailed writeup of all these reviews, I thought I would just explain why I gave the lowest rating on the board here, a 3/5, to ""Breaking Bad"".  It's because I don't know how it ends.  When I was watching ""LOST"" I thought it was great too, and then a little less great, and finally on the last show the whole mystique and fascination of the show was gone and my excitement long gone, replaced by just wanting it to be over, though I still liked it and found it interesting.  ""Breaking Bad"" is a bit like that, so I don't want to give it a high rating, or a low rating, and if it is like ""LOST"" maybe a 3/5 is well-deserved.  Sorry to offend all the fanatics here who said nothing and gave the show a 5/5.*** Thought I was just reviewing the season 5 summary episode ... but I have to admit the opening episode of season 6 is tense, gripping and very well done.  Everything is dropping away and we are starting to see who Hank is and who Walter is.  I find myself really fearing for Hank and wondering where this sudden will to live is coming from in Walter.  Great episode.",Negative
"I like to sleep to these so I can have some crazy dreams =) They talk about some things and make some good points. Gods are probably just aliens, by definition.

"I loved the story of Amy Dorrit, the child of the Marshalsea Prison, which was where she was born and where, at the beginning of the novel she still lives with her aging father, The Father of the Marshalsea. The Marshalsea is a debtor's prison Dicken's father had resided in the Marshalsea after he fell on hard times and although Dickens did not reside in the Marshalsea, he did visit his family there on Sundays.If a man is thrown into prison due to his inability to pay his debts, how is he then to pay his debts while in prison? His children leave daily with their mother, if there is one, to work. Amy Dorrit leaves the prison daily under the admiring eyes of Joe, the gatekeeper and works for Mrs. Clennam, the paralyzed matriarch of a family business. There Amy meets Arthur Clennam a much older man who is visiting his mother and who has spent years abroad working with his father. Arthur has returned to London due to his father's death.Social justice and social class again define this Dicken's novel. Amy is a working girl while Arthur is merchant class; Mrs. Clennam sees herself as something more than merchant class, although the house she is trapped in which symbolizes herself and her facade, is falling down. Joe loves Amy and wants to marry her and keep her at the Marshalsea. Amy loves Arthur but Arthur won't admit that he loves Amy, he thinks he loves &#34;Pet&#34; and the plot, so cunningly devised, goes round and round.Great characters. Great settings. Fabulous film and I will watch it again.",Positive

"Although I&#8217;ve never, and probably will never go duck hunting, I loved this series.  Why, you might ask?  These sequences are created on a basic Founding Father concept:  Unity is Powerful.  In addition emphasis is placed on the first and original unity, the family.  Different as we all are even in our immediate family, we are major contributors to the success and accomplishments of this unit.  The family is we learn to cooperate for the common good.  Is this an easy task?  NO.  But it does work when it is practiced in all aspects of the family.  Great and needed lessons for our country!  Bob&#8217;s Girl",Positive
"If you enjoy complex, troubled characters, great acting, and intriguing crimes then you will love this series. Robson Green is magnificent.",Positive
"Young mystery writers learning your craft take note. In fact, take lots of notes. G.K. Chesterton's plots are rich with ideas worthy enough to adopt, coax, pinch and tweak as your own.",Positive
"Cast was good.  Less drug use would be an improvement.  Otherwise, it was nice enough but would not make a point of watching it so wouldn'r recommend you make an entire season of it.",Negative
I like shows set in that era. It gives you a look at how some people might have lived then. I like the costumes. I like how they show people from different &#34;classes&#34; live and or work in the same place.,Positive

"I am very very impressed by this season of Doctor Who. I'm a late starter, watching this season. I had to catch up, and now I'm regretting starting late this season. The writing is fresh, interesting and funny. Love all the season 7 episodes so far. I still miss the Ponds, though.",Positive

Great show!!,Positive
"Law & Order: SVU is definitely one of my favorite shows on TV.  I only discovered it about a year and a half ago and have since become completely addicted.  I purchased the first seven seasons and noticed that the eighth season was not on DVD yet.  That didn't make much sense to me because this season aired in 2006-2007.At any rate, I'm so happy that they are releasing season eight now!  I only hope that season nine follows soon after.  And after this season is finished, I hope they don't wait too long to put it on DVD as well.If you like Law & Order, chances are you'll like this show too.",Positive
"Why, oh why, oh why, do writers go on holiday after two successful seasons. I just can't wait for next season where I suppose they will introduce the X Men along with Green Lantern.",Negative
I was hooked on the first episode of season 1. I love the characters. Even the music is great. Have you noticed the sounds of the ship and the size of the doors between rooms? Just what one would expect if one were on an actual spaceship. The most annoying thing though is the voice of Gaius Baltor. Makes my throat hurt listening to him.,Positive
Good story line. Acting is excellent. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Some violence and killing.  Not for family viewing.,Positive
Both the film and the subject. I've never seen a group of more dysfunctional and dangerous people ever. Not worth the time. Who wants to know about people of this ilk anyway. Yuk.,Negative
"Totally enjoyed Season 2. The DVD shipped fast however,one of the disks was loose and has signs of some rubbing during shipment. The DVD played fine with no glitches so all is good.",Positive
"This is a potential of being a great show about nerds for nerds.Most shows that have nerds usually depict them in a demeaning way. The nerd babbles some nerdy thing at which point the ""cool kid""/main character usually tells the nerd to get to the point. In ""Betas"", the nerd/geek may say something nerdy, but it is not followed up by a demeaning dismissive tone by the next character since the next character and most of the other characters of the show are also geeks/nerds.At times this sort of reminded me of a nerd version of ""Clerks"".The dialog is great if you are also a tech lover. But at times, I thought the dialog tried too much to sound nerdy/trendy. For example one of the characters makes a twitter reference by saying ""Hash Tag Intense"". That's like someone talking text speak in everyday life: i.e. bff's, lol, rofl, etc. Maybe people actually talk like that, but I've never met anyone like that.I liked most of the characters, but some of them need more polishing or better writing.For example:=Trey is the ""main"" character. He seems too ""normal"". He needs to show that he's also a geek.=Nash was a bit too whiny. He needs to be more likable like Richard Ayoade's character from ""The IT Crowd""=Hobbes was good, but he need more material when he can be outlandishly, Kramer-like funny. For example, the show missed a great opportunity when the ""ValetMe"" crew (the group of people that our heros didn't like) was offering JagerBombs at the bar that our heroes were located. Hobbes should have gotten a few shots for himself off camera. His friends could have lambasted him for fraternizing with the ""enemy"" and Hobbes could have said something like ""free alcohol is free alcohol - I don't care whose giving it out"".=Mitch needs the most work. He's sort of a blah character right now.=Mickey was greatEd Begley Jr. was also in the show. I've never been a great fan of his.",Positive
The madness never goes to the end. To much blood; the bad people always win. All the episodes always are the same stories:revenge.You feel like the happiness won't happen.,Negative
"This is one of the best series I've watched in a loooong time.  The characters are loveable, unforgettable and endearing.  I recommend this to all my TV-watching friends.",Positive
"For the most part, I enjoyed the first season of Lie to Me. Tim Roth is a fine actor, and very well cast as the protagonist, Dr. Lightman. He lends depth and intensity to a script that sometimes veers into the dangerous waters of daytime drama. The plots are uniformly interesting, and nicely paced.  The filming was crisp, and the directing was tight, which made up for the woeful mediocrity of the rest of the cast. (The one notable exception to an otherwise bland supporting cast being Mekhi Phifer who plays Agent Ben Reynolds.  But, you have to wait until the end of the first season for this much needed spice.)The real problem with Lie to Me is that, unlike Bones, there is very little science in the science. (And now I am going to speak as someone who has spent countless hours of doctoral research on cross-cultural nonverbal communication.) While the main ideas behind the psycholinguistics of deception are correct, some of the ""data"" presented in this show are completely misleading.  Somehow the writers, whether in their ignorance of the subtleties of the field, or in the interest of presenting something palatable to a general TV audience, have missed the basic point of psycholinguistics, which is that nonverbal and paralinguistic modes of communication are shared by all members of a given society.  In other words, we are all ""naturals."" Reading subtle facial cues (""body language"") is a vital part of what keeps society going. In fact, individuals who cannot read these subtle cues are diagnosable as autistic. (Asberger's Syndrome is a form of autism in which the individual cannot read nonverbal emotional cues.) So, there really isn't any magic in reading nonverbal cues.The other side of that coin is that we cannot correctly interpret nonverbal cues if we are not members of that society.  While it is true that there are some universal expressions (fear, surprise), the vast majority of facial cues are culture specific. Lying falls into that category. If a Mayan Indian smiles, nods and says ""yes"" after being told the world will end in 2012, he or she is NOT agreeing with you, but he or she is also not lying. (Nodding, smiling and saying ""yes"" are merely signs of politeness. If you asked that same person if he or she had murdered someone after breakfast that morning, you would receive exactly the same response.) The only thing a psycholinguist can accurately judge is whether a person from a given society is displaying discomfort or anxiety.  The cause of that discomfort is unknown, of course, and does not mean that the person is lying. (Which is why polygraphs are so notoriously unreliable. Telling the truth can make a person even more uncomfortable than lying.) In that light, I found the constant refrain of ""You're lying!"" to be not only irritating, but highly inaccurate. (There are also quite a few factual errors which not only reveal a profound ignorance of the legal system on the part of the writers, but an unwillingness to do simple research, both of which are inexcusable in the age of the internet.)In spite of the reservations I have about this show, I still found it fun to watch Tim Roth, if not much else.",Negative
"On the down side a somewhat well worn storyline of people suddenly waking up in some undisclosed secure location and having to fight or kill follow abductees to find freedom. Has been done in many manifestations before. Nothing new here; same overhead surveillance cameras with our hidden captor at first known only through their voice. Typical cage fighting - martial arts or whatever one can come up with for fighting. Back story, also done before, of wealthy audience being entertained throughout as inmates fight-for-life. Overacting, bad person roles especially; thus, not too believable. Ending scenes came across as even less believable and therefore viewer engaging.On the up side, follow up with the slightly similar ""The Seasoning House"".",Negative
"I think she is amazing, would love to see her in action in person. It is better this year. Very interesting",Positive
I give this mini series five stars.  The acting was as wonderful as the story.  It does a great job of capturing the time period.  I love Mr. Darcy!!!,Positive
"I would give this movie 5 stars, but I felt there was something missing. The feel of the old Star Trek, the honest human element of reason. All of which Gene Roddenbury gave us in his Star Trek. I know those were low or no budget and they had to fill the show with something, so they went the cheap way. But, that was an element of hope and clarity for the future or humankind.  I have watched Star Trek since I was a young child, I met Deforest Kelly, William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, George Taki, and James Doohan at various conventions when I was younger. Sometimes more than once. My point is, I was addicted to the show and the shows that came after. All four series were excellent in their own right. This movie while it is lacking that something, is excellent too, in it's own right. All right, I hear the ""Boo's"" already, and you probably think I am either on crack or nuts. I get it. Well, the nut's is debatable, but, I assure you I am quite sober. I read some of the reviews, and I feel that the reviewers missed something. We are no longer in the 60's, the 80's, the 90's etc. And there is something that Star Trek has always been, a reflection of the current political, social, and overall mindset of the time period. True there has always been a message that Gene Roddenberry has given us. That message is lacking here. Going into this movie expecting to see the Gene Roddenberry Star Trek is like expecting ""Enterprise"" to be a remake of the original Star Trek. It just isn't so. I loved this movie as a movie that took place in the Star Trek universe. Was it perfect, NO! But, it certainly had merit. And, I remind you, that we had not seen anything new ""Star Trek"" related in years prior to this movie. So, those of you who did not like the movie, I understand. Perhaps if you gave it a chance based solely on the fact that it does take place in the Star Trek universe, you might enjoy it. Those of you who see the merit in this movie lets hope they keep making these movies so that maybe we will get a Star Trek TV series out of the franchise.Ralph J. Fitcher.",Positive
I love this show! Mark Harmon and crew really have great chemistry together on screen. I am happy to hear that Mark signed on for season 11 and so has the rest of the crew. Each show reveals a little bit more about each character. May this show live on for many more season... Sad day when it does end its reign.,Positive
I just love justifed.  I am on season 4. I dont know what I am going to do when it is finished,Positive
"The show continues to be worthwhile in the second season.  I think the Juliette plotline is a stale trope and should have been cut short.  I think the characters and their development, outside of Nick and Juliette who stagnate the whole season, continue to be strong.  Still a decent show in a sea of mediocrity.",Positive
"We own all seasons and love this show. It's always good for a laugh it's just getting old. How many times do penny and Leonard  have to break up. Howard's comments. We feel Amy has brought great laughs to the series. Now stop. The same old same old and get some excitement and real laughs back in the series.,  it's stale. Still funny but stale",Negative
I've watched this show from the very beginning and liked it a lot.  This season did not hold my attention for even 2 episodes.  It's so boring.,Negative
"It beats watching a blank screen. However, I just don't seem to be in tune with to comedy of today.",Negative
"If you have already seen the competing versions of this new tv show, you might start paling on the very idea of viewing yet another one. This is based on Jason Mott's novel which involves a small boy returning to his home decades after he drowned and died there. His parents are now old people but they do recognize him as their child. This is just the opening salvo as the formerly dead start showing up everywhere. Are they zombies, aka The Walking Dead? Well, if they are it is not obvious yet. But the fact that there are so many of them creates a growing problem. In this new ABC show and in the French LES REVENANTS (THE RETURNED) the essential plot point is identical. The new people are in exactly the same shape as when they died and the same age. They want to pick up their lives right where they left off. This throws the other people for a big loop as you might expect.So we start out knowing that France already had an incredibly similar series, LES REVENANTS (THE RETURNED), which aired about two years ago in France and a few months ago on Sundance. It was critically and popularly a hit but it was in French language and subtitled which means less of an audience. It featured a young girl who had died who returns to her home after she has risen from the dead.  She too is followed by others of her kind. Again, unknown if they are zombies but there is something off about them which eventually shows on their skins.About a year ago the BBC aired a show called IN THE FLESH which was about zombies cured and maintained by the socialist government, much like the AIDS virus is today. This was successful in the UK and BBC America. This was very good as it had a satirical element to it. There is of course AMC's ratings juggernaut THE WALKING DEAD which is about surviving in an actual zombie overrun earth, which is similar to the novel and movie WORLD WAR Z, written by Max Brooks and starring Brad Pitt. The novel was outstanding and the movie was good. There is also a movie called THE RETURNED which has the zombies controlled by medication but then the RX runs out. It was also very good.My biggest problem, having seen all of the above, is I have reached the melt down point with zombie or risen from the dead tv shows and movies.  There are just too many of them. If you have not seen all of the above, you are probably going to be more receptive to this new ABC show than I am. This reminds me of decades ago when tv was dominated by westerns.  It was so over saturated with them that getting a western made afterwards became the hardest sell in the business.  We may be heading there with zombies.What is the very best of all this zombie media? For me nothing beats Max Brooks' novel WORLD WAR Z. It is the book you must read as the movie is quite different. Max Brooks has become a cult figure with young people on college campuses as a result of these books and his talks are huge hits.  You cannot be into zombies and skip reading this book.Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

"Season 2 was as enjoyable as season 1.  I liked that the issues changed and matured with the teens. H2O reminded me of Flipper and Gidget from the 1960s.  The plots ran to sibling rivalry, fights with each other and boyfriends, misunderstandings, embarrassments, and the joy of swimming and playing in the water. Must see for teens who like fantasy, The scenery is beautiful.  The costumes superb.  Some of the special effects are silly, but easily overlooked.",Positive
"I loved the humor of the stand-up comics featured here. I only got the free episode listed at the beginning of the season, but it probably gives a good idea of what is contained in the rest of the season. I have actually watched several episodes of this season when I was having a free 30-day trial membership in Amazon prime, which I eventually plan to become a paid subscriber to.",Positive
"Boy was I fooled! I don't want to give anything away with this story but I have to say as far as rom-coms go...thoroughly enjoyable. There is a nice little twist in here that makes you smile broadly. This is not an hysterically funny movie, there are a few chuckles sprinkled though it. The stars here are the story, the dialog and some totally wonderful performances by Alyssa Milano, Christopher Gorham and Michael Landes.  You will have to think about the ending....my lips are sealed.",Positive
I am intrigued by the olden days of witchcraft and Salem let's me into that world. The special effects are great and the characters are interesting.,Positive

This was a fantastic show.  It was witty and clever.  The characters and storyline were perfect.  This is an oldie but a goodie.,Positive
"I started out watching this show in Season 1, because the name got me curious. I don't normally like sitcoms and I am not a fan of the whole Odd Couple routine, so I was surprised to really like this TV show. Somehow everyone on the show makes you like them even Chloe for all her narcissistic, rather evil scheming ways who really can't help but find herself being positively influenced by her sweet girl-next-door roommate June. Who actually is the only one that really gets Chloe and can stand up to her at the same time.Having James Van Der Beek on the show playing himself and poking sly fun at the whole celebrity/Hollywood crowd is an added bonus of fun and he and the two lead actresses, Krysten Ritter, Dreama Walker, should be walking away with armloads of Emmys for their being able to generate a comedy show that's fresh, funny and naughty in the best way possible.I never know what an episode will bring, everyone makes me laugh, and the snarky satirical moments they manage to slip in that sometimes say more about society's ills than any trumpeting politician ever can are brilliant. Everyone should watch this show and please, please, please never switch out the writers who do this or pressure Krysten's Chloe to be a little less bad or Dreama's June to be a little less goody-goody.They are the perfect Odd Couple girl team.UPDATE: I was so heartbroken when they canceled this show. And then the remaining unaired episodes for Season 2 were released making me realize that Yes Virginia, there really IS a Santa Claus after all. Even if my name isn't Virginia I feel like it's Christmas morning anyways. :D",Positive
"So, okay, I love the concept and execution of the set. It's a simple set with a single Blu-Ray format case housing first the Blu discs, then the DVDs, and coming with a single UV redemption code for the whole season in high def.It comes with a couple bonus features on both the Blu / DVD discs (last disc, I think?)...Overall, I like the execution. I think this is how things should generally be released going forward. Kudos on that, WB! Blu for high def, DVD for low-def or for sharing with friends who haven't yet upgraded and UV for online streaming or downloadable personal digital copy. Kind of like future-proofing. Makes sense to me.However, I'll note that, for whatever reason, the 'high def' video quality doesn't seem all that great. Especially watching on UV via VUDU (haven't tried yet via CinemaNow to see if the same problems persist via a different UV ecosystem provider). It's especially apparent on the pilot episode, but seems endemic. While it's high def there seem to be lots of compression artifacts abounding making he picture look pretty poor quality, especially noticeable on my 60"" TV when you get right up close. It looks pretty bad...So, I put in the Blu-Ray just to compare. It looks *a bit better* on Blu-Ray proper, but there's still quite a bit of graininess. So, I'm a bit disappointed. I don't know if it's 'cause the original was shot at lower def and upgraded, or whether the transfer just wasn't done cleanly from film or whatever.I haven't yet looked closely at season 2 Blu's yet to see if the problems persist with the transfer. I'll take a look more closely at some point and find out.Overall, though, I love the set and the show itself. And since one sits the better part of 8-10 feet away from the screen the artifacts aren't terribly noticeable at that distance. Right up close it's VERY noticeable, especially streaming, probably due to compression algorithms being somewhat 'lossy?' But I can forgive it sin ethe overall set is great.Can't wait for Seasons 3-4 to update to the Blu+DVD+UV format, since it looks like they were originally released in Blu-only format (no DVD or UV). Once you ship 'em that way (combo pack), I'll pick 'em up, very few questions asked. As long as they're done as well as these are. I'm all for it! And the combo-ness is a good thing, sinec my friend who loves the show hasn't yet upgraded to a Blu-ray player and he LOVES the show too, so with the combo pack, we can still enjoy them over at his place and laugh our butts off for hours on end. Thanks! That's all!",Positive
Tosh is one of the funniest stand ups I have seen. I was glad when the show started and am glad that I have been able to watch a few seasons on Amazon Instant Video.,Positive
Excellent series.  Lots of intrigue and mystry.  The characters are great and it is well acted.  Highly recommend this period piece.,Positive
"This PBS version of Mansfield Park is so much superior to the motion picture version of the same, which chose to sensationalize the back story instead.",Positive
"So far, we are enjoying this season more than the past season or so.  Occasionally, the episodes still get a little silly/trivial.  But mostly, we really enjoy the show.",Positive
"This show started out wonderful!  Cleaning up messes in DC, wow very nice!  Loved it!  Then last season wow Hucks character just when nuts!  This got a little brutal, torturing a team mate on the show, pulling teeth, a little to graphic!  We will see how they do next time around!  The show brings new surprises in each episode!  Hold onto your knickers, the sky is the limit!",Positive
I read the background on this series and though oook.  Turned out to be entertaining.  The twists and sometimes mysteries to the story pull the viewer in.,Positive
So far the first show has been very good.  Look forward to seeing how it progresses.,Positive
Well this one is a good as the rest. I do not know s I have seen a bad Dr. Who. episode.  The new cohort/sidekick is extra easy on the eyes and the whole story follows the who themes.  A good watch.,Positive
"We love this show!  The acting is incredible and the storyline is very believable.  There are characters you love to hate (like Tiffy) and then there are characters you adore, and others who surprise you in varying episodes.  Scott Foley is so good - you never know what to think about him - whether he's sometimes careless or otherwise brilliant and shows his &#34;human&#34; side.  He is also very good at dropping in bouts of humor when they are very much needed.  I highly recommend this show!",Positive
"My wife and I like Westerns- when Hell on Wheels (HoW) first season came out we watched it and enjoyed it quite a lot and looked forward to the next installment.  We just finished Season 2 and sadly it wasn't as good.  The first 2 episodes were pretty disjointed and it almost seemed like they threw the scripts together as if they didn't know they'd been renewed for another season.  Things come together by the third episode however and got better.  Part of the problem with 10 episode series that have 42 minutes of content- you have to pack a lot into each minute and this leaves plot advancement and character development behind...in other words, you have to pay close attention.  The killing off of more than one major character was also off-putting and disappointing.  All that said, we will likely watch Season 3 on DVD and hope for the best.  Haters who critique the show on it's historical accuracy need to remind themselves that HoW is a drama, not a documentary.  I'm looking forward to Mr. Bohannon exacting some righteous vengeance for the wrongs perpetrated in this outing of the show.",Positive
"The show seems like it struggled to get off the ground, the storyline tried to be adult-oriented, but is too ignorant and simplistic to attract its target audience.",Negative
"Tipical movie to watch when you do not want to pay attention to the plot. Cute, ok acting and the cast is pretty funny.",Negative
Everyday when I got home from school I watched schoolhouse rock. It amazes me how many of the songs I remember. Kids today should have a look at these.,Positive

disappointing - characters are silly and their reactions are even worse - opening scene of chaos was badly directed. i like this kind of film but it is no Invasion LA,Negative
"This is one of very few current TV shows which is worth my time to watch. Most of the shows on TV now are vulgar, violent, unfunny or intent on pushing an offensive social or sexual agenda - even the so-called animated comedies. Even the game shows are starting to lean way Left (Jeopardy clues etc.). Most Reality shows are just plain stupid and fall into the above description as well. Though NCIS is often more GP than G rated, it has great characters and good plots.",Positive
This is an exciting and good show. Lots of turns and twists and the more you watch the more you get to know.,Positive
"ABC Studios gives fairy tale lovers a wonderful gift with the release of ""Once Upon a Time: The Complete Second Season."" The 5-disc box set features all 22 episodes and a satisfying amount of special features for those looking for a peek behind the curtain. The show continues to spin a complex web of intrigue and fantasy in its sophomore year.The curse is broken and magic has come to Storybrooke. The citizens of the town now remember who they were in Fairy Tale Land. They must come to grips with their present lives as the memories of their past lives and who they were all come flooding back to them. The adjustments are made even more difficult with the arrival of Regina's evil mother, Cora, and her devilish associate, Captain Hook.The script writers for ""Once Upon a Time"" know how to keep a viewer glued to the screen and emotionally attached to the characters. They constantly switch between Fairy Tale World and the present-day town of Storybrooke to keep things interesting. Where some shows may feel crowded with too many characters, that isn't the case here. Each person fits into the different plotlines and contributes what they need to.New special guest stars are always popping up on ""Once Upon a Time."" In Season Two, we get some interesting talent showing up. Rose McGowan, Ethan Embry, and Elizabeth Hershey are a few of them. Elizabeth Hershey and Rose McGowan both play Regina's mother, Cora, at different ages. They couldn't be more perfect for the deliciously evil role. They give the character an emotional depth and motivation which make you feel sorry for and despise her all at the same time.Whether you've seen the show in HD or just regularly broadcast, ""Once Upon a Time: The Complete Second Season"" is a delight to see on Blu-ray. The rich colors and perfect picture clarity will enchant audiences as they watch the episodes for the first or second times. A 5.1 surround mix brings Storybrooke and Fairy Tale Land to life with the sounds of the enchanted forest, New York City, and a breathtaking musical score.There's some entertaining bonus material for the Blu-ray edition of ""Once Upon a Time: The Complete Second Season."" Six audio commentaries include actors Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Robert Carlyle, Lana Parrilla, and Colin O'Donoghue as well as co-creators/executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, writer Jane Espenson, writer Ian Goldberg, writer Andrew Chambliss, and co-executive producer David H. Goodman. It also contains four featurettes entitled ""A Fractured Family Tree,"" ""Girl Power,"" ""Sincerely, Hook,"" and ""Good Morning Storybrooke."" Deleted scenes and bloopers round out the extra features.""Once Upon a Time: The Complete Second Season"" will provide fans of Disney Princesses and Grimm's Fairy Tales with hours of excitement. It mixes the romantic and dark elements of both worlds together in one phenomenal show. Be sure you start watching it with enough free time in front of you. You'll no doubt find yourself unable to pull yourself away from the television once it gets rolling.",Positive
great show... keeps getting better... i cant wait for season 4... one question though: who's mowing all the grass? ;),Positive
"This is a weak comedy that finds itself funny in many scenes while you watch uncomfortably, waiting for real laughs to come.  They rarely, if ever, do.Then it--of course--bores us to oppression with the obligatory love interest subplot.Elizabeth Banks is capable of so much more as a comedic actress.  This movie wasted her talents by refusing to write funny dialogue or intensely uncomfortable scenes, and failing to include any funny side characters for her to bounce off of.Most of the scenes seem like unfinished rehearsals, in which the funny parts have not been discovered or written yet.  But they filmed it all anyway and called it a movie.TERRIBLE.",Negative
this show needs to be made the story moves forward at a good pace and is well written I almost didn't watch it because its about football but its actually good,Positive
"I wasn't expecting this show to be this good. The writing is great and the storylines are engaging, as are the characters. The acting is spot on. All to be expected from a Rockne O'banion production. So if you liked FARSCAPE or FIREFLY you're gonna love this, but don't get too attached to it. It's a Syfy original show, so it's probably already been cancelled or will be soon.",Positive
Always fun to watch AFV when you need a good laugh. How can you possibly go wrong watching funny videos on a show for funny videos?,Positive
"The music is good, and certainly an interesting niche to tell a story about.  The conflicts and stories chosen to tell leave a lot to be desired.",Negative
the series is interesting and very informative. The characters make the show,Negative
"My problem with Season 2 of ""The Walking Dead"" is that it dragged and dragged and DRAGGED. Not the case with Season 3! Wow, so much happens this season and you will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. I won't give away any spoilers, but just know that NO ONE is safe and every single character can and very well may die at any given moment, which is one of the things that makes this show so great. Also, the additions of two new characters this season, Michonne and the infamous Governor, are not to be missed. Both actors bring amazing depth to their characters and really make this season of the show the best yet. Can't wait for Season 4!",Positive
"IT looked alright at first,I mean they land on A moon for what ever reason,and when they get there things start to happen.People die for one thing they may of found life if you can believe that.I'm sorry but in my view it could of been done better.",Negative
"The wife likes it, I can tolerate it so it is a good compromise between our tastes.  The acting is good, the premise behind the story is flawed but, like most stuff that get produced in Hollywood, you just have to turn off your brain and enjoy what's there.",Positive
"I like the solving the crime shows.  I just wish Castle and Beckett would finally get married.  You can tell they want to, but the writers keep dragging it out.",Positive
Love this show with all my heart! It's a romance without being mushy and horror all rolled into one story! The quality of the downloads is great!,Positive
"While I don't normally watch this type of British comedy, I was surprised to find it on Amazon Instant video and missing my British TV I decided to watch it and found it enjoyable. I just wish Amazon would get in more British programs like Midsomer Murders, Vera, Scott & Bailey, Casualty; comedies like My Family, Vicar of Dibley, Keeping Up Appearances or even older ones like Open All Hours and Are You Being Served.  Quality programs not over the top stupid like they have on BBC 3.",Positive
"I'd hoped that in addition to interviews with knuckleball pitchers, the DVD would also show pitches in slow-motion, from angles that allowed one to clearly see how the ball behaves on the way to the plate. Also some description of the physics involved, and an explanation of why there are so few knuckleball pitchers. Didn't happen.",Negative
"We LOVE Shaun the sheep! Just good clean fun, with humor that hits at multiple levels, so it's fun for adults too.",Positive
"It's kinda like watching 'Lost' all over again, but I still like to watch the show. I saw it all the way through & am waiting for more episodes.",Positive
"This not a &#34;gore fest&#34; teen movie. But the gore deserves a special effects award and is itself a &#34;character&#34;.The plot twists are as clever as the killer and those who endeavor to stop him.  Unpredictable and well paced.  Superb acting, direction, script and cinematography.If you enjoyed the &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34;, you will not be disappointed in this series nor the actor portraying Hannibal.",Positive
"Good quality, good show. I am sad that it was cancelled (especially given the point at which they cancelled it). I guess it did not have the viewer turn out that one needs to be in a prime time slot. Whatever. It was a pretty good show, and I always enjoyed watching it.",Positive
It is good but so old that the producers could not take advantage of animation which helps with war documentaries.,Positive
Maybe I'm just a vampire junkie or a Jonathan Rhys-Myers junkie or both but I really enjoyed this series.  I hope it comes back for another season.  It was an exciting drama and I loved the tension and build of the romance with Mina.  They couldn't have cast a better vampire than JRM.  I loved the Tudors and now this is wonderful.  So yummy!,Positive
I loved the first season. My only issue is that I got impatient and wanted to know who did it after the first episode.,Positive
The first two episodes' guest stars are Eyal Podell and Brandon Barash - both sleeper stars biding their time in the land of Daytime Television aka soap operas.,Positive
"I have not been privy to the behind the scenes wheeling and dealing of the corporate world but I believe it is every bit as sleazy and slimy as depicted in this film.  Richard Gere really pulls it off and plays the ultimate sophisticated, cultured and impeccably coiffed slime-bag.  I have very conflicting feelings about this film; I hate it because I think it's about the world we live in today where it seems ethics and morals have no place in life when there's lots of money to be made.  The film is ultimately sad with few uplifting moments except for a few moments with Jimmy.  Jimmy is the only major character in the film who provides some weighty counterbalance on the evil scale because of his basic goodness, decentness and loyalty.  Roles were well played by all but major kudos to Richard Gere; the man can act.",Positive
"3 1/2 Stars, but I clicked 4-Star because it leans in that direction.There is a lot to like about this show and not as many things to dislike.Mary McDonnell works for me in just about any role she has done. If she is limited here, it is the fault of the writers.A lot of people seem to dislike the character of Rusty, but that's just a testament to how good a job he is doing acting out the role of the narcissistic delinquent.The two greatest shortcomings--especially as this show fills a second season--are the lackluster characters from the DA's office and the too-often experienced suspension of disbelief.Did all of the writers from The Closer decide not to come along? Whenever I feel uneasy about what I'm seeing on the screen, I realize it is the fault of the writers, not the actors.",Positive
"The item was just as described.  Also, I really enjoyed watching the DVD's -- I would recommend that everyone buy a copy of Psych Second Season!",Positive
"I was hooked on &#34;The Originals&#34; even before the show was created, announced and aired.  I have love The Originals in Vampire Diaries from the very first introduction.  I am hoping the writers/creators of the show will take us back to the very beginning and show how, when and why they were created.  My vampire of vampires is NiKlaus and Elijah.  This is a series that I hope and pray will have years of episodes.  It has become my number one must watch show of the new season.",Positive
I actually watched the first 2 seasons on tv. I gave only 3 stars because the males seem to be depicted as having gotten mush in the brain since the first episode and act a little like weak women. While the women seem to have taken over and are front and center. Not as good a show to me now and that is why I stopped watching it on tv. I know the &#34;matriarchy is coming&#34; but come on Hollywood not yet :(,Negative
"This show is funny, charming, quirky, and the casting is perfect!  The young boy in this series is fabulous in this roleand David Walton has found the perfect show for his talents. Every episode so far has been sweet and entertaining, but include plenty of high-jinks to keep you coming back.",Positive
"I purchased this as a gift for my son for Christmas, these shows can make anyones holiday delightful. Sheldon  is extremely intelligent, but can't relate to other people or their emotions.Leonard is a hopeless romantic, and a complete nerd. Howard, lovable, yet has a mother complex problem.Raj is east indian , can't get a girlfriend, and can not talk to women unless he is drinking.GREAT SHOW, WORTH EVERY PENNY.",Positive
I started  watching this show and now I am hooked. It's right up there with Breaking Bad. It has just enough redneck humor in it to make the characters believable. Great casting.,Positive
I was not sure that this series would be good but was familiar with Inspector Lewis from the John Thaw series.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well done the shows are with interesting scripts and good acting.,Positive
"I almost feel embarrassed that I really like this television show.  Heck, I almost love it.After all, some of the subtext of ""Grimm"" is pretty obvious:  if you're a Wessen -- or perhaps even a Grimm -- you've been discriminated against over the ages and it's about time that you are treated like any other monster.  Can't we all get together, sing Kumbaya, and just get along already?  Kinda like real-life groups that feel as if they've been mistreated over time:  women; blacks; Native Americans; you name it.  I would even say white men over 40 nowadays in modern-day-PC America.But I kind of like the way that ""Grimm"" shows these parallels, in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way.  It feels as if even the writers themselves get a good chuckle out of the comparisons, in the way that the interactions occur between the main characters here.And this show really is about the characters.  The smartest move that they made immediately with this show:  they decided to update it by having modern-day descendants of medieval warriors fight this updated battle.  And that battle is fought on the streets and surrounding areas of Portland, Oregon, which was another nice choice, as the gray skies and constant drizzle add to the grim feel of the show without making it depressing.  And I really like the color palette that the director chooses to help liven it up a bit; note the green tones in particular.I like all of the characters here for the most part, and even though obviously the lead -- David Giuntoli -- has real star quality, I really like the Silas Weir Mitchell character.  I find him to be very sympathetic, maybe even likeable.  And I rarely appreciate anyone's work solely because he comes off as being ""likeable;"" that is usually just a word that is used for sub-par actors and sub-par people.  Not so with Mr. Mitchell.Well, if you feel that you've been oppressed, treated badly, or even bullied -- that would pretty much be everyone I suppose -- this show should be for you.  I think that you'll like the characters a lot, and you won't mind the whole let's-just-get-along message thrown in for good measure.",Positive
"These guys are fawning all over the females and everybody they come in contact with. It's getting so sappy that it's hard to watch. I liked it better when they were stronger characters who did medical comedy and adventure. I like the guy from Spanish Prisoner, he's strong and rock solid. the boys are too whimpy and wishy washy. Pretty people everywhere.",Negative
"Started watching Walking Dead because I follow Chris Hardwick's Nerdist podcasts and pretty much enjoy most everything he gets nerdy over so I thought I had to at least give it a chance since he was such a huge fan w/his Talking Dead show. I watched Season 1 & 2 on Netflix in just two days and was so hooked I started paying for each episode on Season 3 via Amazon Prime... it was REALLY hard to wait for new episodes once I caught up with the season about mid-way through. I do not consider myself a big horror fan but this show is different (like everyone else says), the pace is basically perfect, and what I really like is all the twists and turns the characters take, and that no character is ever truly safe in this war zone like, zombie apocalypse world... no random red shirt appearances on this show for sure and every character whether you love 'em or hate 'em, well you never know how long they have!I do wish Amazon carried The Talking Dead after show as well. We haven't had cable for a year now and between Netflix, Hulu+ and Amazon Prime streaming/purchasing I am all set and only pay for the shows that really matter to me, like this one! Can NOT wait until Season 4! Seriously, you are missing an historic TV phenomenon if you aren't watching the Walking Dead!",Positive
"Unlike American crime series which invariably have the main characters looking like models, alot of the Brit series aren't afraid to feature realistic looking actors. Vera is dumpy, middle aged and not athletic. She drinks and leads a lonely life. But she solves the crimes and is not always right at the beginning of an investigation.......she's a relief after the Law and Order beauties and the gimmicky characters in NCIS .Love this series and recommend it.",Positive
"I have always loved her ever since China Beach! This is an awesome show! Funny at times, sad and scary at times. It has it all! Great show!",Positive
"It was ok of a series I just did not like the story line, John Ritter was great though so if you like him I think you should watch it.",Negative
"This won't be much of a review, except to say that I really enjoy this show. Season 4 is just as good as the previous seasons, and it's nice now that Danny finally has a steady partner. Great cop show meets strong family values.",Positive
The writing was bad. The acting was bad. How can you ruin a bloodsucker show ? Watch it if you like but I would save my money if I where you.,Negative
I love how much my daughter and family learn about different prehistoric creatures!  That's not the only skills we learn that are modeled for us on the show.  I love that the family dynamics model common challenging situations and helpful solutions that can be applied in my family.  The show is also colorful and simply lovely to watch.  This is one of my favorite PBS shows.  Enjoy!,Positive
Many parts are funny but why curse if you know before hand that their going to blip the words out. It seems as though every fourth word is an open space in the dialogue. It gets annoying after awhile.,Negative
"Bosch is definitely the best of the new Original's lineup. First rate all the way. This teaser episode did its job well. I want more.The only negative about the show is the child abuse aspect. If the show gets any more graphic with the child abuse, I won't be able to watch it.",Positive
I was very glad to see my favorite professor is heading back to the states where he does his best work.,Positive
I love watching this program. I love to see what the chiefs come up out of the weird and sometimes strange ingredients.,Positive
"If you haven't seen this series on Amazon (free to Prime members), then get with it.  Old fashioned lawman in modern times who is a complex guy in his personal life.  This series is a sleeper with 3seasons on Prime and one available at a reasonable price for the chance to see the last season quickly.  This is a GREAT series",Positive
"Very good, but a little slow to start.  Younger participants did not know what they were getting into.  Very good way of learning how their Grandparent's generation lived and how hard they worked for very little pay.",Positive
Seeing Reggie come alive in Clunes has been a true pleasure to watch! The cast is extremely well suited to compliment him in every way.,Positive
We love Curious George. It's a adorable show that my son loves to watch. No violence. Just a little mischief!,Positive
Might be well made but I did not care for the storyline at all. It just didn't seem to go anywhere other than &#34;day in the life&#34; meanderings of artsy New Yorkers.,Negative
"This may be related to my sense of humor or my generation, but these people are no Robin Williams, or even Jeff Duham.  Too much commentary on social issues or nu-relatable events instead of relating to common values or situations.",Negative
"This was a very entertaining series.  Good plots, good acting, interesting characters.  Plenty of humor to go with the crime stuff.  Even my wife liked it, and she is not a t.v. person in general.  Can't imagine watching these series on network t.v. with constant commercial breaks.  But they are great on Amazon Prime.",Positive
Loved this season just as much as seasons 1 through 3. I'm sure the current season is just as exciting. Now to catch up on the cutrent season. Love Amazon Prime. Hope I never run out of interesting programs and movies to watch. And also love all the other benefits of PRIME. It's the ultimate deal. Love Amazon.,Positive
I really like this show can't wait until season 4 comes to prime. I even paid for a few of these shows.,Positive
"These were real actor's , it's a pretty good movie over all.  It was a whole lot better then the movie &#34; Blood widow&#34; seriously that movie was horrible.  I would watch this movie again , but I wouldn't rent it I'd wait until it hits SCIFI net work. It's a scifi original!",Negative
"I would say it would be a good show, I think this would make a good Motion Picture or sitcom or something.",Positive
"US Deputy Marshall Raylen Givens is such a suave, tough, big hearted, no nonsense cowboy. This show has it's funny side, but the writing is excellent. Timothy Olyphant does a fantastic job in this character, and the writer's give him some of the best lines. I would almost guess the writer was also one of the writer's for Die Hard. It is that kind of intelligent wit.Great show -- just started Season 3.",Positive
"Unlike Dexter, this writing team gets it!  The story is arcing and arcing quick to a plausible situation.  Drama and moments I expect the story to be in while in Season 2.5 Stars!",Positive
"look into the world of biker gangs. This show was a long time coming, and the scripts are influenced by real tales of the underworld. Fantastic cast and into the 6th year it's still a compelling show.",Positive
"Thought this might be entertaining and funny but it was just a too realistic view of people solely focused on themselves and the awful, hurtful behavior that goes along with those types of priorities. We found it rather depressing to watch, not at all humorous, more head shaking in disbelief that this was actually a show.",Negative
"The characters are good, acting is good, however, this is a graphic, gory television show. The carnage detracts from the story. I wonder how long it will be before some sick person wanting attention starts to copy the crimes in shows like this one and Criminal Minds.",Negative
"OMG, the first episode was awesome! I can't wait to see the rest of the season. I love, the love hate relationship between Raylan and Boyd. When it all boils down, they need each other. (Kane & Able) Hurry up and get well Raylan! Even at his worst, he still bought in the bad guy! Love, love, love, this show!!!!!!",Positive
"I have always liked the tv show castle, now I don't have to be bothered by weather shutting of the program. It is a very entertaining show. The price was good. Shipping was fantastic. I would recommend this show. The main characters are believably compatible and look like they are having fun",Positive
This show's going to take a while to develop but it's headed in the right direction.  It's starting to find its legs and is different from all other network comedies with sharp dialogue and adult situations.  Greg Kinnear holds the show together and he has a great supporting cast including the talented John Ortiz.,Positive
"This is well done, and well acted.  Some of it is standard network fare but watching it without commercials improves it considerably.  I'm looking forward to the next season.",Positive
"Good series.  Has everything.  Some adventure, some sap, some mystery.  Really pulled me in when learn past lives of characters before the bombs.",Positive
Decent thriller - a couple of scenes didn't make sense (why didn't the ghost just kill the psycho brother?) But all in all- it's worth a watch. It's &#34; silence of the lambs&#34; spooky with a supernatural twist. Notthe best movie- but not the worst either.,Negative
"OMG, this show was FUNNY!!!  I was literally rolling on the floor.  And the funniest thing is - the script is actually GOP-spewed rhetoric translated into plain English.  Judge yourself - here are just a couple of lines from the show - ""I know [she doesn't look like one of us - referring to a Latina girlfriend of one of the Republican congressmen], but once you get to know her, she's actually very rich and powerful"" or ""Daddy, a professor gave me a B+ in Isaiah studies, he hates me, I think he is a socialist.""  All the people complaining and rating this show down are probably Republican reps and supporters who didn't like an honest look at themselves.",Positive
"MST 3000 is often hilarious.  This episode was slow and tedious with a smart and funny barb coming in at a pace of 1 every 15 minutes.  Dull and boring, I'm sorry to say.",Negative
"Grimm's first season set up an interesting world.  Season 2 took that world and went into crazy relationship stories.  It takes the entire season for Nick to fix his relationship with his girlfriend.  Monroe hooks up with the store shop owner.  Everyone knows about Nick being a Grimm.  Like &#34;Buffy,&#34; and &#34;Angel&#34; the TV show is now about a group of people helping the super powered detective solve crimes committed by the supernatural.  Everyone in the group has their own &#34;relationship&#34; nonsense going on including love triangles.  Meanwhile the overall &#34;mystery&#34; has very little resolution.  Two Seasons finished and no real understanding of Grimm history or the &#34;Royalty&#34; and the &#34;key&#34; seems like something that the show will be lucky to explain before the series is cancelled.By removing Nick having to keep his secret it simplifies way too much.  Plus the entire season practically dealing with his girl getting her memories back was tiresome after about 5 episodes.  Drag it out all season?  No thanks.",Negative
"This review is for the Season 6 Episode 5 of the show for Amazon Instant Video, not just for the show.  I enjoy the show very much; however, the service from Amazon Instant Video is very slow.  The episode is already out on iTunes....I am thinking of canceling the TV pass and signing up for it on iTunes since they have the same thing.  It is sort of odd that Amazon isn't more competitive with their service considering their competition.  I know you can also watch it for free on the Logo site but for some I cannot get it to pay on my puter right now.",Negative
I'm a huge Errol Morris fan.  Making good documentaries takes serious courage but when the subject of your film is an infamous  question dodger you better be prepared to ask tough questions and push him for real answers.  This film leads you don't a rabbit hole to nowhere.  I'm pissed that Morris allows Rumsfeld to smile mockingly at the camera for an hour and say absolutely nothing of consequence.  I rented a curtain reveal but instead of a brand new car I wound up with the 1970's vacuum.  Thanks a lot Jim.,Negative
I loved all 3 seasons of Lie to Me! I have to say the main character got a little goofier in the 3rd season but still a great show! I felt left down that it ended without real closure. I wanted more!I may be imagining it but I notice I watch peoples facial expressions a little closer since viewing Lie to Me. Maybe there really is something to reading lies!,Positive
"This really isn't very good. But considering its obvious budget limitations and the lame story line, it is better than it should be. That may seems like faint praise but it did, barely, hold my attention all the way to the disappointing end. And there were a few moments that even seemed to hint at something better.",Negative
"I liked the actors, except one who is awful. The Indian, socially awkward actor is awful.I think the character Kirk Lazarus said it best in the movie Tropic thunder.""Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, 'Rain Man,' look retarded, act retarded, not retarded. Counted toothpicks, cheated cards. Autistic, sho'. Not retarded. You know Tom Hanks, 'Forrest Gump.' Slow, yes. Retarded, maybe. Braces on his legs. But he charmed the pants off Nixon and won a ping-pong competition. That ain't retarded. Peter Sellers, ""Being There."" Infantile, yes. Retarded, no. You went full retard, man. Never go full retard. You don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, ""I Am Sam."" Remember? Went full retard, went home empty handed...""They have the wild card, the brains, the fool, the rebel they need the cool. Get a dumb joke, make him really good at reading people, add him to the mix. Three awkwars is too many. But aside from that, the Indian actor who plays that character brings down the entire show, look at his face it is soooooo forced. Just brings down the rest of the cast.Fix it. Remove the indian actor add the ""dumb jock"" archtype and you have a show.",Positive
Really enjoyed this and am looking forward to seeing where they take it in season 2. I love the setting and cinematography. There'sa sort of &#34;cleanliness&#34; and clarity about it that really grabbed me.,Positive
"I also watched Bag of Bones on DVD which is based on a novel by Stephen King. I bought the book years ago on the bargain shelf at Barnes & Nobles. I read it quickly and loved it. When the miniseries aired back in December, I had other things going on and I didn't get a chance to watch it. Bag of Bones is good, but several things have been changed and left out from the book. I love ghost stories, so I naturally love it despite of it's flaws.",Negative
"Emile Hirsch and Stephen Dorff are brothers Frank and Jerry living in a Reno motel. When Jerry gets involved with a fatal car accident, the brothers have to run away from Reno, and travel to Elko, where Annie James (Dakota Fanning), a young girl Frank once loved, lives.&#8220;The Motel Life&#8221; is not a thriller. Producers-turned-directors Alan Polsky and Gabe Polsky (their feature debut) seem more interested in the precarious living of the brothers without dreams or future, than the accident and its aftermath. The brothers&#8217; dreary life, often symbolized by the cold streets, makes a great contrast with the animation section showing storytelling skills of one of the brothers.So far the film is fine, and the animation is pretty impressive, probably more impressive than the film&#8217;s main story, where not much happens in the comparatively short running time. To me, the story seems underwritten and sometimes disjointed, with flashbacks that do not allow us to know much about Frank, Jerry or Annie. Also, the episode of the car accident, which should have great impact on the life of brothers, is sidelined and eventually forgotten.Emile Hirsch and Stephen Dorff deliver solid performances. Kris Kristofferson is also fine though Dakota Fanning is wasted. &#8220;The Motel Life&#8221; is a decent drama with effective performances from the stars, but perhaps you should not expect much beyond that.",Negative
"I like how different these people are, fun to watch.",Positive
Off to a slow start in episode one but shows promise. I will continue with that hope and give a more in depth eval.,Negative
Discovered this quite by accident and watched the entire season in one weekend.  Love the interaction between Crewes and Reese and the mystery within a mystery concept.,Positive
Would easily get four stars if they hadn't cut it off after one season. Talented cast and a suspense filled plot line made it exciting. Another poor decision at the 'suits' level of network television. Remember &#34;Flash Forward?&#34;,Negative
"I'm not really liking the season much this year... #11 is not only the team-thing full-time, but worse than that the designs are uninspiring. The team-thing is my least favorite of the challenges, as it is full of conflict... so an entire season of this is painful.And if that wasn't enough, this season's shows are popping up real late here at Amazon Instant (well after its competitors already have the new episodes up and on sale), so I've cancelled the season pass.",Negative
"I found the September 11 episode particularly moving.  Despite all the coverage of that tough day, there were still some aspects brought out here that I hadn't heard before.",Positive
"Little Bill is fun for a wide variety of ages.  I have two grandchildren ages 5 and 7, one boy, one girl, and they both like Little Bill.",Positive
still awesome at vol2. my kids love wild kratts and learn tons every time they watch it. the kratt brothers are very energetic and enthusiastic. listening to them makes you feel happy.this and curious george i could let my kids watch all day long.,Positive
"I have to say, &#8216;Cutie and the Boxer&#8217; may be the most rewarding film I&#8217;ve seen this year, for the simple fact that I had no idea what it was about before seeing it and it moved me in such unexpected ways before it was completed.  The finale felt so beautifully appropriate, and the mixture of emotions that is felt from both of the film&#8217;s protagonists (can that word still be used within the framework of a documentary?) is truly authentic and poignant.What makes &#8216;Cutie and the Boxer&#8217; so effective is the fact that it is not really what it says it is, and in fact pulls off something even more enriching, emotionally so, and becomes a piece of true reflection, not on the primary subject at all but on a deeper and more universal subject.I&#8217;ll try and explain.&#8216;Cutie and the Boxer&#8217; is a documentary about the work and marriage of two Japanese artists who traveled from their homeland to New York City in the late 60&#8217;s.  Noriko, from a wealthier family, meets struggling artist Ushio and is drawn to his fearless love of the arts.  He thrusts himself into his passions and this is alluring, despite the danger that comes from this careless lack of responsibility.  It may be infectious, but it is also damaging.  Noriko soon finds herself sacrificing her own ideals and her own passions as an artist when she becomes pregnant and Ushio&#8217;s drinking takes over his life.  Despite having raw talent, their ambitious, especially those of Ushio, are bigger than his audience and he soon finds that while the general public admires his work, no one wants to buy it.Fast forward nearly four decades and you have the portrait of a devoted couple who are obviously fraying at the edges.  Noriko has stood by her man despite wanted to claw his throat on many occasions, and despite being practically destitute financially, they still hold fast to their art.  Their son has suffered immensely for his parent&#8217;s mistakes, especially his father&#8217;s, and has turned to alcoholism himself.  With a showcase looming over the horizon, which offers both Noriko and Ushio a chance for recognition, &#8216;Cutie and the Boxer&#8217; chronicles their preparation for this gallery opening.But the focus is NOT on their art.The beauty of this film is the way that it paints such an honest portrait of marriage.  Through Noriko&#8217;s animation we are able to see the evolution of their marriage and the struggle that she has gone through, not only as an artist but as a woman.  She strives to pick up the pieces of her husband as well as rediscover her own identity while always being relegated to his shadow, which is why the film&#8217;s finale is so rewarding.  This is Noriko&#8217;s story, and as such it is one of female empowerment and the triumphant spirit that entangles and propels many to success.  Watching the reactions from both Noriko and Ushio is very touching, because there is nothing held back despite the subtlety in their appearance.  This film beautifully captures the remorse, regret, anticipation, depression and validation that comes to those pursuing a life of art, a life of passion.  Despite the obvious marital and artistic setbacks, Noriko sums it up best when she expresses that her life of passion has made her better off.",Positive
I have been a Sherlock Holmes fan for many years but if you're expecting something that tracks with the old Holmes you won't get it.  Instead you'll get the Holmes' updated persona and cleverly twisting plots that takes deductive reasoning to new heights.  Solid mysteries with a 20th century twist.,Positive
"As with most series, you have to watch enough episodes to get to know the star characters before you get hooked. As the characters progress as the series goes along, making them more interesting and human.I give this series 5 stars even though I find it a little bit hard to follow sometimes and the accents are at times hard for a southern boy like me to understand. But I always get the gist of it and move along. 5 STARS",Positive
"This is in color; they use cameras that shoot well in low light so eye pupils look huge; the actors are all pretty, with perfect teeth, and nice bone structure. That's where reality ends.Everything else is total fantasy, it has nothing to do with reality, or psychology, or law enforcement, or human behavior, or anything else. It is completely made up. Do not draw any conclusions from this about real life; this only happens on your screen - real life is what's outside your door - go look.",Negative
"I love this series! Jessica Lang is so awesome, she has got some mad acting skills. Can't wait to see the other episodes",Positive
I rented this because Ti West was involved and I have loved his films thusfar.  House of The Devil and Innkeepers especially.  His short film in this about the people on their honeymoon was actually pretty solid.  The remainder of them were straight up craptastic.  I paid $8 to rent this because I was so excited to see it months before it came out.  I actually turned it off before finishing it.  I would not even be willing to rewatch this for $0.  My friend bought it (he is bummed by the mistake) so I ended up finishing it a couple of months later thinking that maybe I was just in a bad mood or something...nope...hated it!,Negative
"I was not really satisfied with the way that the judging went for this particular season--but it was so fun to watch!  I would have preferred for Mondo to win.  Although many of his designs were a bit over the top for my taste, he was who I considered to be the most talented.  My wife thought that Mondo's decision to include that white dress with the huge black polka dots in his final collection lost him him the support of Michael Kors, who had been critical of that design in the preliminary round.  But I liked that dress, so I felt that Mondo should have won.  As for the winner, Gretchen, I just did not like her designs.  It seemed like Heidi, though often critical of Gretchen, was always kind of pushing her along and supporting her come what may.  I think that Michael Kors really hit the nail on the head when he characterized Gretchen's designs as having a ""Lady of the Valley"" look.  These sort of loose beige/earthen-toned things were just not what I would consider elegant, sexy, or fun!  I also felt that April, the blond-haired younger woman, was not given enough credit.  I loved her wild black edgy designs.  Andy clearly deserved to be in the final three--I particularly loved his bathing suit in one of the challenges.  In the end I felt that the final three should have been Mondo, Andy, and April.Casanova, one of the real characters in the competition, was fun to watch.  I particularly remember his weird dress that looked like it was about to slip off the hips of the model--and earned a few amusing comments from Michael Kors--who likened it to something appropriate for a belly dancer or stripper.  Michael Costello was interesting as well.  The poor guy was really maligned in one of the earlier challenges--and accused of being unable to sew.  To his credit, Mondo worked very earnestly with Michael in a team challenge which did much to rehabilitate Michael's image.  Michael was wonderful at draping--but I agreed with the judges that he did not belong as one of the final three.  I think that Michael achieved some kind of record low in his reaction to not making the final three.  His nearly hysterical sobbing was embarrassing to watch!",Positive
Reminds me of how fortunate we are to have the advancement in the medical practices.  Very humbling that so many died and through their deaths our healthcare is so improved.Acting is superb.,Positive
"Much to our dismay, the show came to an end, boohoohoo! However, knowing it was The Final Season, the writers (and actors, of course) handled it well and closed it out terrifically. We miss our evenings watching Eureka -- we felt like the characters become old friends, but unlike some shows (i.e. LOST and/or HEROES), this one wrapped up well, closing off the story lines, not leaving anyone out, and with a relatively &#34;happy&#34; solution.",Positive
Excellent series. Very entertaining. A must see.,Positive
My husband and I watch this show together to relax.  These guys and gals really work hard to make their living!,Positive
Good storyline which keeps evolving.  It will be interesting to see where the storyline will go now that his identity is known to others.,Positive

"""Old school American horror."" That was the tagline to Adam Green's ""Hatchet"" back in 2006, but the film was mostly comedy with all of the horror and gore being in the final 20 minutes or so. But Victor Crowley became an icon for some reason. Why he did and Leslie Vernon didn't is another story entirely. Nevertheless, ""Hatchet II"" was released four years later in AMC theaters with an NC-17 rating, but it was pulled literally two days after opening. Obviously the gore was too intense for viewers or it was so intensely scary that it was thrown back to the studio. It turns out that the film was just really bad and its decomposing funk was probably stinking up AMC movie theaters across the nation. The acting was beyond terrible and while the gore was ridiculous yet superb, itIn the opening moments of ""Hatchet III,"" Marybeth shoves her fist through Victor Crowley's face before Crowley falls back onto a running chainsaw that splits him in half and showers Marybeth with blood. Somehow this is only scratching the surface of how gory this sequel really is. Grown men are ripped in half, their heads are knocked clean off their bodies, skulls are stomped, and limbs are torn from their torsos. All of that and it doesn't even cover a pair of testicles hanging from a tree that's referenced at least half a dozen times.There are a lot of little gems and throwbacks to the previous two films in ""Hatchet III."" It would be a shame to spoil the most spectacular kills and biggest surprises, so covering the more obvious ones seems safe enough to mention here. There have always been horror movie legends buried in the casts of the ""Hatchet"" films. Kane Hodder and Danielle Harris aren't exactly strangers themselves. ""Hatchet III"" brings in Jason Trost (""The FP,"" ""All Superheroes Must Die,""), Derek Mears (""Friday the 13th,"" ""Predators"") and Sid Haig (""House of 1000 Corpses,"" ""The Devil's Rejects""). Writer Adam Green (cameraman BJ McDonnell from the first two ""Hatchet"" films takes the director's seat this time) even has a humorous little cameo.The sequel is an all-around improvement over the last film. The story is as simple as it has been the first two times out, but at least the acting is better in ""Hatchet III."" Danielle Harris was never really quite as awful in anything before ""Hatchet II."" She's more reserved in ""Hatchet III,"" spends most of her time brooding, and doesn't talk quite as much, which maybe makes her more tolerable. However her white trash accent really makes you grind your teeth at times. Sheriff Fowler (Zach Galligan) is really over the top while the extremely machismo demeanor Hawes (Derek Mears) has gets under your skin as soon as he steps off the boat.It's great that the film doesn't take itself too seriously though. There's at least one really good jab to the previous sequel in ""Hatchet III."" What makes it as entertaining as it is its obvious homage to the slasher films the ""Hatchet"" franchise pays tribute to. The SWAT team blasting everything in sight seems like an obvious reference to ""Jason Goes to Hell"" while there's some makeup effects at the end of the film that are similar to some of the effects in ""Jason Takes Manhattan."" Caroline Williams has the best scenes the sequel has to offer. Amanda's interrogation of Marybeth while she's in jail is the most engrossing scene in the film thanks to Williams' performance.""Hatchet III"" isn't going to win you over if you didn't like the first two ""Hatchet"" films, but it does seem to put the franchise back on track. The practical makeup effects and splatter house type gore is even more awesome and ridiculous than in the previous film. ""Hatchet III"" feels more like the ""old school American horror"" the original film promised that violently shoves comedy in the back seat while gruesome terror gets behind the wheel.",Negative

"I'm glad to see something related to this side of the music industry.  Hopefully they'll keep the story line more about the drama of the music and industry, and less about the hype-stuff like drugs and sex to keep people hooked.

"Here we watch the master of serial killers weaving his way through the lives of FBI profilers, agents, doctors, law enforcement specialists, troubled victims, and other active or potential serial killers.  A master of disguise and manipulation up to his own nefarious plans, feeding his own bloody desires, and puppeteering the weak-minded and the innocent.Let me promise you this:  Hannibal's plans are interesting.  His deeds are dark and exciting.  His deft handling of people is inspiring.  His opponents are just as intelligent, but not as crafty.  Also . . . and most troubling . . . his meals are surprisingly mouth-watering.You've been warned.  This show will sweep you up into its arms and mesmerize you.  It is twisted, bloody, macabre and intelligent, clever, and thrilling.The characters are each unique, unpredictable, and brought to life by the best of actors.  They each have their own personal troubles to augment the main storyline of each show and the over-arching storyline of Hannibal's manipulation.Not only is this series a homage to Hannibal, but it is an evolution of Thomas Harris' beloved characters.  This series can go on in many transmutations for years as long as it pits the troubled minds of Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter against each other.This is one of greatest dark stories on television.  Move over Dexter.  This is serial killing brought to a whole new level.Thrilling and full of twists.  Nobody gets out of this series unaffected, unharmed.  Even Hannibal himself!Good stuff!  WATCH or BUY it NOW.",Positive
"I don't know if it was the movie, the lack of hysterical commentary or just me, but this wasn't one of KST3K's best efforts.  Outside of Forest Tucker jokes (which are always worth a laugh) there wasn't enough bad material to keep the show going.  Took me 3 sessions to finish it all off, at which point I was happy to see it over as opposed to wishing it would keep on going.But, as they say, even a bad MST3K is better than a good day at work.",Negative
"A bit heavy on the display of savagery possible by some individuals, it is an excellent crime drama series which I recommend.  There is so much available on Amazon Prime of quality; 1, 2, 3, seasons or more at your fingertips and your enjoyment.  As good as a good novel, such a series draws you in and keeps you coming back until the last episode of the last season currently available.",Positive

I don't watch it all the time with her but I do so occasionally and  I am comfortable with the content.

"This is the best season SO FAR.  On some shows when the sexual tension Is released or goes on too long between the main characters the show gets stupid or stale.  The fact that there could be life, and one of their best seasons (been a devoted fan since season 1 episode 1) after marriage indicates that this is a true murder mystery show and that the other characters are much more than mere sidekicks.",Positive
"I love Chris Colfer in Glee which is why I rented this movie but at was a little skeptical since it is based on high school. But after the first 5 minutes I was completely hooked. Allison Janney just steals the movie, she is incredible. But the whole cast is great. There are a lot of moments when you think &#34;Yup, that's definitely my high school&#34;This is an enjoyable movie. If you are avoiding watching it because &#34;You don't like Glee&#34; that is the wrong reason. This is nothing like Glee at all.",Positive
"The Disappearance of Alice Creed is a REALLY good thriller.  It's about two kidnappers that hold a young girl at ransom for 2 million dollars.  They come up with the perfect plan, the likes of which is completely original in all the years I've been watching movies with a similar concept.  And EXCITING?  You bet!To be totally honest, it would be a great disservice to explain in detail the way these events unfold because the way the story is written, spoiling the MANY twists and turns here on amazon would be an unfortune shame, so I can't do it.  Let's just say, there's an extremely good chance you've never seen a kidnappping plot quite like this one!  The ONLY thing I'll say is that one of the kidnappers is actually in a relationship with the girl tied down to the bed.  This leads to several more awesome segments and twists.  Oh and, betrayal and hiding the clues might be the key words to describe this movie, hehe.  Right down to the ending I had no idea which way the writers were taking this one- another sign of successfully executed storytelling.There's a couple sexual related scenes that are pretty strong, but other than that, expect to be on the edge of your seat anticipating all the ways these two masked men figure out exactly the right plan to obtain the money.  Actor Eddie Marsan is *tremendous* as a kidnapper.  A really believable looking and intimidating bad guy- perfect for the role.  He makes the movie as excellent as can be.  Highly recommended.",Positive
"I thought this show was exactly like the original Storage Wars show. Everything seems the same, but the people on it. I believe the people on the original show is much better. They bring a more interesting view on their finding and explain more about what they see and find before and/or after they see a locker. While this show does the same thing, they don't do it as well.These Texas people do bring some different elements to the show. They more likely to bid low and keep low on their bids on lockers. They don't go buck wild like the City Folk as they call them in Texas. They all have similar but different personality to the original show cast members.Moe similar to Barry.Dave similar to VictorBubba and Ricky similar to Darrell and Brandon.Ricky and Lesa are similar to Jarrod and BrandiThis show is recommend if you really like the original Storage Wars show.",Positive
"This series is pretty high budget and the re-enactments very realistic.  But the best, or at least most engaging part of the program, is the way crash investigators piece together the problems that caused the crash.  Really makes you wonder about the safety of air travel and the human/machine interactions that take place in the cockpit and in the traffic control tower.",Positive
"want to know why amazon doesn't have several seasons - it's annoying to go through 1 to 5, skip 6 to 10 and then juimp back to season 15 - get with it amazon! Those of us who love this series want to watch it in order",Positive
Watching this on my Amazon Prime movies was really quite a treat. Much better than a lot of mainstream movies. Actor Willem Dafoe gives an outstanding performance here in this much different type of movie.,Positive

"Ah, the British! They have their eccentricities that have been providing fodder for little films for years - from the great stories of EM Forster, Evelyn Waugh, Julian Fellowes et al to the little dramadies such as this one written by director Donald Rice with Mary Henely-Magill, CHEERFUL WEATHER FOR THE WEDDING. They come off best when the odd class-oriented families take themselves seriously, covering their narrow view of the world of civility with accents so thick and rapidly delivered that without subtitles it is difficult to follow the script! But they are enchanting, especially when delivered by a cast of superb actors who are able to enter these odd characters' psyches and make us titter while we endure their snobbishness.This film is meticulously presented and is both a celebration of English eccentricity and an understated examination of how families often do everything they can to avoid saying how they really feel. Dolly Thatcham (Felicity Jones) is to be married to the wealthy Owen (James Norton) after a very brief engagement: Dolly delays her preparations for the ceremony by drinking rum upstairs as she has flashbacks to her real romance a summer ago with the young professor Joseph Patten (Luke Treadaway) whom Dolly has invited to the wedding (to her mother's (Elizabeth McGovern) chagrin and Joseph waits downstairs with the entire bizarre family and friends awaiting Dolly's descent to proceed to the church. The story is interrupted with all manner of subplots including the strange behavior of Dolly's younger sister Kitty (Ellie Kendrick) who provides the audience with a navet&eacute; that reveals so much about what everyone else is really thinking but just can't bring themselves to say.Among the entertaining eccentrics having luncheon before the wedding are the bickering married couple (Fenella Woolgar and Mackenzie Crook) attempting to stop their son young Jimmy (Ben Greaves-Neil) from setting off little bombs throughout the house, aging but silly Aunt Bella (Barbara Flynn) seducing her chauffeur (Emil Lager), the perennial old maid Miss Spoon (Joanna Hole), the day's drunk Tom (Olly Alexander) and of course the only people about whom we care - the servants (Eva Traynor, Paola Dionisotti, Sophie Stanton, Kenneth Collard.  The use of flashbacks to give us insight into Dolly's dilemma of marrying for convenience instead of for love is beautifully handled by creating a golden glow touch to the sequences from the past by cinematographer John Lee and a lovely musical score by Michael Price.  And in a final farewell speech Joseph manages to put everything in its rightful place. It all works well, but put on the subtitles or you'll be in the dark.  Grady Harp, December 12",Positive
"Amazingly clever and witty, Great Show! The cast is perfect together, the writing is refreshing to say the least, well done.",Positive
"Bottom Line: Somewhat campy, but an enjoyable somewhat light hearted version of Batman. I enjoyed the artwork and most if not all of the stories in the series.Let's get serious; any superhero cartoon is inherently a fantasy story. If someone actually tried to apprehend criminals the way Batman does in any of the comic books, movies, or television shows, then the police would hunt him down and kill him. So, there is an implied balance between the fantasy and the ""realistic"" elements of the superhero story. In the case of BATMAN: The Brave and the Bold, the stories are more light-hearted and campy with the balance clearly leaning toward the fantasy side of the story.I tend to agree with many of the other viewers that of all the Batman television series,Batman: The Complete Animated Seriesdoes the best job of finding an entertaining balance, but that doesn't mean that you should completely discount BATMAN: The Brave and The Bold.However, if you prefer you Batman to be only dark and tormented, then this series isn't for you. If you can enjoy a Batman that is a bit of a parody of himself, then this might be something you can enjoy. Likewise, while child suitable, there are some jokes that clearly aimed at the parents.",Positive
"The Following is an interesting show.  You have a psychopath and all his followers on the loose killing people at random.  I like the concept, I truly do.  That said, my only real complaints about the show is the sheer amount of &#8220;followers&#8221; Joe Carroll possesses.  It seems as if everyone and their mother&#8212;literally at times&#8212;has joined forces with him and has no problems with taking another person&#8217;s life.  I get that when it comes to cults people can be brainwashed, but at times it seems a little ridiculous.  Other than that the show is full of suspense, action, characters that you either love or hate, and mayhem.  If you haven&#8217;t checked it out already it&#8217;s worth checking out.  It&#8217;s not the best show on television, but it has its moments and it&#8217;s entertaining.",Positive
"I avoided this show because of the cover, assuming it would be full of racy scenes but someone recommended it so I decided to give it a try. Now my wife and I both really enjoy the show. There is little bad language, few sexually overt scenes and provocative apparel is seldom seen and has no influence in the show itself. The stories are well done and interesting and the acting is excellent.",Positive
It is fun to see Dominic West (The Wire) in a totally different milieu. This is a good atmospheric British series.,Positive

"If you want to watch CSI Miami, season 10, I recommend you avoid the DVD version and upgrade to Blu-Ray now as the TV studios obviously want.  The picture quality of TV on DVD is on a downward slide for many series.  The TV studios are deliberately shipping DVD discs with inferior video to kill the format and to make Blu-Ray look better than it is.  Here, the DVDs are so blurry I can't watch them.  I CAN'T SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING!  I own most, possibly all seasons of CSI Miami on DVD; the early seasons are fine, 10 is a visual mess.SEA HUNT Season One on DVD 1958 *underwater* has sharper picture quality than CSI MIAMI Season Ten DVDs.  I'm not joking: if you don't believe me, check it for yourself!  CBS wants us on Blu-Ray.I have yet up upgrade my viewing to Blu-Ray; but there may also be another factor at play.  Remember first generation STAR TREK, where the close-up shots of the sexy female guest star would be shot through a lens that made her look sexier by blur?  David Caruso would look like a wrinkled grandfather if Blu-Ray did a high-resolution close-up on his face; and Emily Procter is also getting up there in years.  I suspect a state-of-the-art optical lens during shooting supplies just the right blur for the Blu-Ray discs to obscure the age of the stars, knocking the actual viewing experience back down into the DVD realm; but the studio can't ship the exact same viewing experience on both DVD and Blu-Ray discs, so the studio adds an additional digital blur to the DVD discs.Can you say, time for a Class Action Suit?@hg47",Negative
"With almost every season of South Park you always have the odd one or two episodes that weren't really that good. Season 1 it was Weight Gain 4000, Season 2 it was Terrence & Phillip in not without my Anus and so on, as with all seasons although you have the bad episodes, you always have your personal favourites but Season 11 is in my personal view the strongest and most unique season to date. With episodes ranging from racial controversy to a trilogy of episodes setting the boys in Imaginationland and ended up with its own DVD releases.Episode 1: With Apologies To Jesse Jackson: This is a Randy Marsh episode and shows the true no holds barred attitude that Matt Stone & Trey Parker have towards writing an episode. Randy is on an episode of Wheel of Fortune and accidentally uses the N word, which causes an uproar and singles Randy out as ""That N***er Guy."" This episode is obviously a reflection on the American society in relation to the N word and satires the whole subject, extremely funny episode with some great one liners.Episode 2: Cartman Sucks: Again this is another controversial episode but this one is entirely around Cartman, of a night Cartman has Butters stay over at his house and while Butters is asleep, Cartman plays pranks on Butters then takes pictures of it. One prank backfires on Cartman which he's afraid will make people think he's gay, he thinks Kyle has the picture and is ready to show it to the class so Cartman enters on a panicky mission to try and save his skin. Amazingly funny as we see Cartman show some vulnerability.Episode 3: Lice Capades: One of the boys has head lice and Cartman leads a mission to try and find out who it is. Meanwhile in one of the boys heads one of the lice suspects that their environment will be aware of the affect the lice are having and may try to get rid of them. Now it's a race against time to try and convince the Lice that the environment wants to get rid of them. A great parody episode that shows the evil side of Cartman as he goes on this manhunt simply to make fun of the person with lice.Episode 4: The Snuke: One day while in class a young Muslim boy is introduced as the new student, Cartman becomes suspicious that he may be a terrorist and enlists Kyle to help him look into the background of this kid. In a 24 style episode Cartman unwittingly discovers a conspiracy to take down America and its government. This is possibly THE most controversial episode of them all as it made the news in England for the ending, the clear parody of Hilary Clinton is hysterical and makes this an enjoyable episode.Episode 5: Fantastic Easter Special: Stan starts to question the point of Easter which brings him into a conspiracy that has been kept a secret for 2000 years. A great parody of the Da Vinci Code that sees the return of Jesus in one hell of a cool setting and Kyle being Jewish has the opportunity to kill Jesus, will he do it? Enjoy this episode to find out.Episode 6: D-Yikes: Mrs. Garrison is dumped again and she takes it out on the class, the boys get sick of the constant screaming and ranting by Mrs. Garrison and they employ someone to help them out. A classic Mr./Mrs. Garrison episode with one hysterical ending.Episode 7: Night of the Living Homeless: Kyle is approached by a single Homeless man who's looking for some change, after giving the homeless man change more homeless people show up in South Park until it becomes an infestation. Cartman creates a goal for himself to jump as many homeless people as he can on his skateboard, while Kyle and the rest of the gang are on a mission to solve the Homeless problem. This is a great parody episode of Night of the Living Dead which gives yet another great part to Randy and shows how stupid he can be.Episode 8: Le Petit Tourette: One day whilst in a toy store, Cartman discovers something wonderful, something that he never believed that could be possible, he discovered Tourettes Syndrome. He sees a kid swearing and getting away with it and he decides that this would be a great excuse to insult those he hates to their faces and get away with it, little does he know however that him being Tourettes deliberately developes into something much worse which he didn't expect.Episode 9: More Crap: Another great Randy Marsh episode, in which Randy endeavours on having the worlds biggest poo, He's faced by some competition however, by the legendary number one at everything, Bono. I have to admit this is the weakest of all the episodes but it still has its classic moments, especially when Bono is in the picture.Episode 10,11,12: Imaginationland: One day Cartman is out to prove to Kyle that Leprechauns exist, the boys made a deal that if Cartman can prove they exist then Kyle must suck his balls. Cartman does manage to capture a Leprechaun but it was on a mission to deliver a warning to Imaginationland of a pending terrorist attack on our imagination. The boys are picked up by an eccentric man who takes the boys to Imaginationland which while they're there the terrorist attack takes place. Kyle, Stan & Butters enter on a mission to help fight the bad side of our Imagination and the terrorists, whilst Cartman sets out to prove that the Leprechaun was real so he can get Kyle to suck his Balls. An absolutely hysterical trilogy of episodes that show the genuine imagination of the South Park creators.Episode 13:  Guitar Queer-o: Stan and Kyle are the best players on the computer game Guitar Hero and they are signed by a record company who wants to display their skills by then gaining 100,000 points at a show in the arcade. Kyle gets manipulated by the record company and is convinced to get a new and better partner, Stan takes it badly and buys a new game called heroin hero in which he must chase the dragon. Again this is an incredibly funny episode that makes fun of those who take these games seriously and spend way too much time on them.Episode 14: The List: The girls of South Park elementary create a list of who they think the cutest boy in the school is. Kyle is placed last on the list but can't believe that he was placed lower on the list than Cartman, this uncovers a conspiracy that the boys would have never expected. It's a great episode that gives us a nostalgic look at some classic moments from previous episodes.As you can see from the descriptions this is a great set of episodes that everybody should own.",Positive

"All 'Project Runway' programs have been great fun to watch! I like to sew, compete, love art and Tim Gunn is a gem.  Although, sometimes I get a little frustrated when they throw in too many non-fabric type projects.  For instance, something such as dresses made out of place mats and plastic binders is novel once during the season, only.  Otherwise, use art and imagination for wearable fashion, please!  Another series I really enjoy is 'Face-Off' on SyFy, which has the same sort of competitive set-up, only it relates to 'creature' creations and make-up.  Fascinating!  Both are truly worth a watch.",Positive
"The season's opening signs suggest a return of some bite that was lost in Season 4.  Boris's castle is a question (and I regret his absence).  HankMed hits NIMBY resistance from a neighbor.  Divya is unhappy with a big thing.  And in episode 2, Hank gets rebuffed by a working-class father and police officer who cannot afford concierge medicine and appears to resent Hank's patronizing offer.  Still, Paige is a dippy smiley face. And Hank is the stick figure character he sometimes is.  But we'll see.  For a fan, it's worth watching so far.  The drama may be getting a bit sharper.",Positive
"The League is a great series.  This is especially true if you are probably in your mid 30's or early 40's and have a fairly juvenile sense of humor.  Of course, it should go without saying that if you are easily offended... you will probably find many instances in any given episode offensive.We're still pretty early in the season, so far however it maintains all the key elements that have kept us entertained for the past 4 seasons.  The only one we found a little lacking was the Rafi/Dirty Randy episode.This is one of those shows that I had to have, despite cutting the cable with satellite/cable providers.  We love the Amazon streaming option, despite the brief commercial for FX shows (usually Sunny in Phily) at the beginning, it's still more than worth the price of admission.

"The story line and the entirety of the movie was simply superb. I enjoyed every minuted of it. I might go and look for a used DVD of the movie so I can watch it as often as I care to without continually paying its somewhat overpriced rental cost considering how long its been in release. Amazon has got to hire someone to review their offerings, especially the ones that cost Prime members money and see if they can't lower the price of some of their fare.For example one movie, one of my favorites of all time used to be free for Prime member. Its The Searchers, the old John Wayne movie made in.....I believe 1956. Now it costs $2.99 to rent a 58 year old movie. I also looked to see about renting some other older classic movies and I couldnt believe that Amazon was forcing Prime members to pay roughly $3.00 to see movies that will soon be considered in the &#34;public domain&#34;. Heck, Netflix has several items that come with their miniscule monthly payment that Amazon charges at least $2.99 for and more often $3.99.......and some you can only buy for like $12.00. Ridiculous and something Amazon should really look into for their most reliable customers, the Amazon Prime Members.",Positive
Not a fun series to watch. Too much heavy drama. I guess there are no good people left in the world and these deeply undercover cops are the only blue line left.,Negative
"It was a long wait to get SMASH on dvd but here it is and the wait was well worth it.  I fell in love with this show from the first second of the first episode with Katharine McPhee singing the intro to SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW.  I love the theater and was so excited that a tv show was actually going to honestly display what went into the production and making of a musical.  This show is different than any other on tv.  The cast is amazing.  Debra Messing, Angelica Huston and Jack Davenport are stars known for other tv roles and these roles are like nothing they have ever done.  And we get Megan Hilty and Christian Borle direct from the Broadway and theater world.  All shine.  Borle and Messing in particular have a great chemistry.The plot takes many twists and turns and will keep you totally enthralled.  What holds it all together like glue are the amazing musical numbers.  There are some current songs performed but the best are the songs written for the musical MARILYN that the show is about putting together.  And for me the true star here is Katharine McPhee.  I have always been a fan but the dimensions of her musical talent are astounding.  Her voice is strong, beautiful, powerful and emotive.  When she sings BEAUTIFUL tears will come to your eyes.  But what is most exciting is how well she meets all the demands of music within a Broadway show.  Her singing of the show tunes in combination with her superb dancing is the highlight here for me.  She's definitely got the IT factor.  Each episode has shining moments and the whole cast is exceptional but for me the whole season builds to the superb final episode and in particular the closing song.  What a high note to end the season on.  There are only 15 episodes here but they perfectly build a story of relationships, drama, dreams, fears, trials and tribulations while showing all the steps in the making of a musical.My only disappointment is that the show was only released on dvd.  I was waiting in high anticipation for a blu ray of this.  The show with all its glitz and glam and superb musical numbers definitely merited it and I also think all true die hard fans would have gone with the blu ray.  But I will settle for the dvd.  I've already rewatched the entire 15 episodes twice and I highly recommend getting this show on dvd.  And don't think you have to love the theater to like this show.  As stated the acting is superb, and the music will pull you in.  The rivalry between Hilty and McPhee is a fun factor in the season but just a glimpse into the whole story line there is.  I can't wait for season 2 in February!  Ane more McPhee!",Positive
Seems like a good series and the characters are interesting.,Negative
she has to go.  need a more dyaminc character to work.  She just doesn't have the &#34;it&#34; factor.  Show will more then likely be cancelled because of her.,Negative
"The entire series 1 & 2 are brilliantly written, directed, performed and produced. The set design, costumes, integration of historical fact with fiction make for compelling viewing. The opening animated graffiti with live action integration and sound design also set the stage for each episode. Even though it is the same for both series I enjoyed watching it over and over at the front of each episode!The acting and cast are brilliant, HBO really know how to produce -this series is one of their best highly recommended!",Positive
"I missed the chance to see this 2012 documentary when I covered  the WXPN Music/Film Festival in April, and I'm glad I got to finally see it, having heard good things from friends who caught it then. I'll admit up front that I was never a big fan of the band Journey (nor most of the bands of the 1970s, so I didn't look it the film from a fan's perspective but, rather, as a music journalist who loves well made documentaries. And it won my approval on this level.The first three words of the title refer to the four core members of the band Journey, who had a ten year string of hits beginning in 1978, when they disbanded, returning as a group in 1995, until their lead singer - Steve Perry - left for good. Perry's replacement for the next 10 years, Steve Augeri, wasn't enough to get the band on the charts. But founding members Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain still believed in the band.  They went to the ""ball"" looking for their Cinderella of a lead singer. In this case the ""ball"" was Youtube, where Schon spotted a young singer in Manila (the Philippines) doing Journey cover songs with his band Foo. They brought that singer - Arnel Pineda - to the US for an audition and the rest, as they say, is musical history. Arnel's been the lead with Journey for the last eight years. So the rest of the film's title belongs to Arnel, since filmmaker Ramona S. Diaz (who specializes in story-driven documentaries) was there (literally a fly on the wall - from that first audition through the end of the band's 2008 world tour (ending in Arnel's home town).Coming from a poor area of Manila , having done, alcohol and drugs and fathering two children (one out of wedlock), Arnel is seeing both the plusses and minuses of fame. (Honestly, after seeing this film I have a lot of empathy for musicians who rise to fame quickly and have no real permanent home life.)For Journey fans there are lots of musical performances and back stage footage (even more on the bonus features). But you don't need to be a fan of the band - or even rock music to get a lot out of the 105-minute film. Like ""Searching for Superman"", about the musician Rodriguez, this film shows what happens when a little-known musician in a third-world country enters the world of rock music fame.If I had to fault the film in any way, it would be that it is a bit too long and sometimes repeats itself. But this, of course, won't deter Journey fans (except those who will debate which lead singer was better: Arnel or Perry).The DVD contains an additional 35 minutes of ""special features"", including insightful featurettes on what the tour crew does, the health issues of touring and a portion of the interview panel from the premiere at the Tribeca Film Fest. The film is also available on Bluray and, as far as I know, it has the same features. The image and sound on the DVD version was just fine for me.For those who just want to see the film, it is scheduled to have its TV debut on PBS on September 30, 2013, however you should note that less than 90-minutes is allotted so at least 20 minutes will be edited out for the PBS showing.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",Positive
Crazy insane movie like wth! I cried in this dog gone movie wow poor girls the ending was a bit over freaking dramatic like ok now we get it ............ its a sad scene... but damn. Anywho's i cried like a baby in the end i aint even gonna lie honey! i cried i was like ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh lord oooooh noooooooooo ohhhh jesus! lol,Positive
"Another stellar season (so far)...I pretty much adore this show and have found the progression of events, the development of the characters, and the willingness to bring in actors from everywhere to enhance specific episodes have been top notch as the show has developed. With a couple plot exceptions, each episode is self contained while still managing to develop and highlight each of the main characters in excellent fashion. The ability to not take itself seriously while still addressing real social issues is also exactly the way it should be.This season obviously runs with Castle and Becketts relationship as they plan for and move towards marriage. The show has, however, managed to avoid all the classic missteps that bringing the two primary cast members together usually encourages. Generally, once the two main characters get together and form a romantic bond, the shows quality tends to drop off. Not so with Castle. If anything, it's made their performances and the screenwriting even stronger.So...kudos to the entire cast and team for pulling off something that too many of its predecessors failed at. Kudos also for maintaining the integrity and progression of the show after so many years.As an addded bonus, you always get a true full season out of this show (i.e. 20+ episodes) rather than the 12 or so episodes that is currently fashionable.",Positive
A great family show. Love all the actors & characters. I really am hooked on this show. Glad I have Amazon Prime.,Positive
"Very engaging.  Some great characters, including the young lead and of course the Maestro.But the drinking game surrounding playing instruments was a bit over the top.",Positive
"I love police drama and so I've seen a lot of police dramas. This show is one of the best police dramas I've ever seen. It comes so close to reality it's scary. it shows the cops as the fallible, dedicated, flawed and sometimes heroic people they are. It doesn't waste time on romances, showing too much about home lives. it shows the dark, gritty and most times frustrating days in the lives of LA cops.",Positive
"This is a show that would be good to watch at the wee hours of the morning after returning from the bar. Course, turning on my Amazon is not the first thought that I have at that time, so I'd probably never watch this show.The Indiana Jones reference was fun, but after they go to the mall it was just banter. Since that is the main setting for the show, most of it will become just banter quickly.",Negative
"This film is about things that are reversed:  people look in the mirror and see the reverse image.  They look into X-rays and see a heart that's on the wrong side.  They look at their spouses and don't recognize them at all.  But it's also about things that are broken:  those same mirrors moments later, the windshields in their cars, and even broken people and relationships.It's hard to review this film in a way, because if you discuss any of the plot, it seems that you may be introducing a spoiler.  But in reality, even after watching, I'm not completely convinced that I know exactly what happened.  I will say that I considered an alternate universe idea -- with an evil doppelganger, perhaps everyone has one (physicists would argue that there are infinite universes, and in each of those, at least where ""you"" exist, ""you"" are different) -- and I did consider the old she-died-and-is-in-purgatory-but-doesn't-know-it-yet idea.  But the ending seems to at least dispel the latter.  I'm still not sure about the former.This film was filmed mostly in London, a city where I have been.  I liked ""The Tube"" scenes.  ""Mind the gap!"" is all that I could think about while watching those scenes, especially when the lead risks her life to fish a photograph off of the tracks.  At any rate, ""mind the gap!"" is surely advice that Americans should heed more often here in the States.  Especially lately.I also really liked the color palette that the director chose; mostly cool and cold blues to set the mood and tone.  And I definitely liked the fact that this was more of a psychological thriller than what Hollywood seems to like to pump out on a constant basis.  Aren't you as sick as I of all those slasher flicks?  At least this is a ""thinking man's"" -- or ""woman's"" -- film I suppose, even though I'm not convinced that all that thinking did me much good figuring out what was really going on.Maybe more of a 3.5, but I'll round up and give them an A- (or B+) for effort.  For execution?  I'll let you decide on a minor recommendation.",Positive
"I always like to watch movies with Judy Dench. The part she played in this film, however, didn't seem to be something I thought did justice to her acting abilities. I didn't care for Cranford so I didn't watch much of it.",Negative
"I suppose a broken marriage might turn out three self centered, greedy, destructive adult children even if the parents seem to have found themselves after the break, but this pilot was just overwhelming for me.  For a half hour pilot there was too much bickering, too much nudity, too much sex with totally unlikeable characters - except perhaps for the father who was the only light in the show - and that only in the very last scene.  Doubt that I will be looking at this one again.",Negative
"This is my favorite show of any shows on tv. Love it, love it and oh yes, love it a lot.",Positive
The story still works after the sexual tension was released. What a relief! I hated the idea that we would be dished out another year of desperate misunderstanding and longing.,Positive
Reasonable connections drawn from facts and history. Multiple topics covered to keep you entertained using 45 minute shows (without commercials).,Positive

well Stephen King did it again.  I loved the series and can't wait till the next season. I did read the book and there was a lot of differences.,Positive
"I missed the series when originally shown, so I have been catching up through instant viewing on Amazon. I watch...let's just say TOO many...of the housewives franchises. I have to say though that this is the most gripping. I like that certainly at the start, all the housewives were TRUE housewives. I also like how the men are featured just as much as the women really; it makes for a more well rounded show. Instead of just the women going on trips together, the husbands...and even grown children...come along too. One thing I will echo, is that the family drama between Teresa, Joe and Melissa has now been a bit played. Perhaps with the casting shake-up, the show will have more to offer from season six forward.",Positive
"I love this show !!! Timothy Olyphant is dreamy and I have loved him since Deadwood. The show is dark but at the same time entertaining, I just love the way they converse with one another, the writing is funny. I do miss Raylans relationship with his wife and him since their split.",Positive

Get your act together, Amazon, and bring back The Mentalist!",Negative
Suits has it al! There is drama and romance. You have comedy and sadness. I was addicted from the first show.,Positive
"I wasn't going to watch this show because it seemed too much like a soap opera to me based on the previews, but boy am I glad I did! This show is amazing. I love all of the people on the show and I really enjoy the premise. Having never seen the original Dallas, I wasn't sure I would be able to follow this newer version, but I have no trouble at all. I would highly recommend this show to anyone interested in watching greed, scheming, lying, backstabbing, and a whole lot of family discord. It is just a fun show and a good time all around.My favorite character on the show is John Ross. He is very handsome and I just love his personality. I find myself rooting for him in every episode. My least favorite is Elena. I just don't like how she's portrayed...too saintly. All in all, watch Dallas!",Positive
"Most actors enjoy having their pictures taken in a positive enviroment.  But with these guys, forget it.  And who basically is to blame.  Us, the people that buy these magazines.  It was really an eye opener.  Of course there are people who are not actors, but publicity hounds who encourage this type of picture taking as it's the only way they can become ""famous"".  I really pity those genuine actors that have to put up with this kind of crap.  I remember being in a restaurant and actually seeing a famous actress standing right next to me.  At least I had the courtesy not to hang all over her or interrupt her time with her new husband at Pete's in Nashville.  So next time you reach for that magazine that ""exposes"" a person.  Remember you are only encouraging these so-called photographers.  We have lost a famous person to this kind of craziness ""Princess Diana"".  Think twice please.  And do watch this movie.  You won't regret it.",Positive
"What can I add about this very clever and hilarious TV series, which I just discovered even though it's in its sixth season, when there are already 441 reviews posted here? Probably not much but I'll try.Though the Complete First Season has been released before, a new ""Combo Pack"" is now out (as of July 10th) with both Blu-ray AND DVD versions plus the new Ultra Violet concept - all in one package. (So you will never be without a chance to watch these episodes again and again.). For those folks who complained that the only ""bonus"" in the original First Season set was the ""Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory"" featurette, you'll be happy to know that they added a gag reel this time. I'm not sure that is enough to replace your earlier set but it's a nice bonus for those - like me - just discovering it.There's no reason to go into the plot of the show - again, it's covered in other reviews - but I did notice that after the first for or five episodes (which at 22 minutes - no commercials - are like potato chips: you can't stop with just one) the characters changes in odd ways. Leonard seems less nerdy and Penny less overtly sexy (plus she must have lost her job at The Cheesecake Factory because by the fourth episode or so she is serving the ""guys"" at a local hamburger place in a non-TCCF uniform.The ONLY thing I found a bit of a downer - and I don't see it mentioned in other reviews - is that the series uses a ""laugh track"" which was very popular in the 1960s before TV comedies started being recorded in front of live audiences. It is really annoying because it sounds phony and you will hear the same laughter over and over, sometimes even before the punch line. It bothered me a lot during the first three episodes but I guess I got used to it a little as time went on. It's just too bad that they felt need to use these.So, I'm jumping on the bandwagon for this series and in the process of ""catching up"". If you've read this review before the others, I hope I've encouraged you to scroll down and read some more. Better yet, just sample an episode and , like me, I'm sure you will get hooked!I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",Positive
"I must admit I watch a lot of these shows. But, I do find the Paranormal Witness to be one of my favorites. This episode, by far, is one of the scariest things I have ever watched! I do find that there are even some questions that still do need to be answered and I hope that after this airs, a serious paranormal team investigates this building and reports its findings. Hope you enjoy......",Positive

"After a breathtaking, fast-paced Season 1, Season 2 has been a little slow getting going and I have not been as excited as I was with Season 1. I hope it picks up. I think perhaps it is the overemphasis on Paige. She is turning into a rather petulant, difficult teen, and I don't find her parts of the stories as compelling. It reminds me of last season on Homeland. We had another teenage daughter there, who was equally petulant and difficult to deal with, and in my opinion both series have been spending too much time on their fussy teenage daughters. I know the parents are worried about the safety of their children, but I would rather see that playing out in perilous situations rather than focusing on Paige's running off on her own, trying to verify the &#34;aunt's&#34; existence.",Negative
"This show started out two season ago on a high note and never lets you down.  Characters are fascinating yet believable and very human.  The ""bad guys"" really are the best guys and gals on TV.",Positive
I loved that all of the originals were back in Lima! I've missed them! Their voices have all improved and I'm enjoying the story lines.,Positive
"Spader is good but a bit 1-dimensional as a character.  They need to develop his quirky side vs the cool sneer he projects as an agent.  At times, the plots are unbelievable in their development and certainly in their rapid resolution, but it's winter and Blacklist is fun, free programming through Prime.",Positive
"Spoiler Alert:I think the surprise end is what sealed it for me. I think I get the point they were making (or were they?). But then, it doesn't explain why all the other deaths have occurred at the tentacles of the monsters. It seemed like they were displaying non-aggressive and inquisitive creatures, who probably attack when provoked only. Yeah, that explained the death of the couple's parties, as the guys went with guns blazing (to save the other family?). But all of the deaths?Some gaps in the plot. The wall was open. It looks like it was not a gated opening so much as just open. And what would be the point?Why was the girl down in Mexico anyway? Why did Dad want her home before the migration?Why was a passport necessary to get on the ferry? The man had already seen it, and allowed them to purchase a ticket. Another family coming to the US was clearly Mexican (sans passports obviously).Well some questions, but we excuse the gaps because the story wasn't about precision, and the romantic dance at the end was somewhat profound.",Positive
"Someone described this before as the X files meets Twin Peaks, and they weren't wrong. But I think it may be even slightly better, as if those two shows weren't already wonderful.This is fresh and lightly done weirdness, with a picturesque town that seems almost normal, and yet just isn't quite. Full of characters, excellent twists on the mutant powers seen in X men and so many other works of fantasy, but described as troubles rather then gifts, mainly because whatever the new guy has got as his or her talent, just isn't under his control. And half the mystery of each show is simply trying to work out what power is at work and who has it, because they don't make it obvious early on.Best of all though, the ending. I won't give away any spoilers, but the twists were unexpected, not telegraphed in any way, and better yet, it doesn't explain all the mysteries. It saves that for season two.I can't wait.Cheers.",Positive
"Wow, season 5 of SouthLand was bitter sweet. I love this show and hate to see it end. I will miss these characters and actors. Season 5 had all the drama and craziness this show is known for, plus some funny moments. SouthLand has always reminded me of Adam 12 on steroids. If you are regular watcher of this series season 5 will not disappoint (except no season 6). If you never watched the show; however, like a gritty cop show this is the show for you. Start at the beginning with season 1. This is edge of seat TV.",Positive
"I caught this film on HDNET as part of a sneak peak before it hit theaters. 'Vanishing on 7th Street' could have been a monumental horror film because it delivers so much in terms of atmosphere and genuine fear that is missing from so many horror films these days. The story starts out with a strange occurrence that draws you in and keeps you intrigued for the entire film. The clever use of shadows is creepy and effective and a nice change of pace from the usual gore and blood that is a poor substitute for true horror. It reminded me of the film 'Ghost'(yes, the romantic film with Swayze and Moore)when the ghosts come for those being damned and brought to Hell.The acting is way above average and the characters react like real people and do things one would think they would do in a situation like this. This film works really well on the big screen because you can feel the scope of the shear mass of this evil darkness that is taking over these survivor's world. Also, there are many instances where the shadows are alive, but it is done subtly and may be missed on a TV screen.My biggest problem with the film could also be the film's best attribute, the ending is left open to one's own interpretation, which will put some viewers off who want closure. For me, I would rather have this type of ending over one that gives too much explanation.......sometimes no explanation is better than a dumb one. ;-b",Positive
"In the spirit of Monster and Cloverfield, this reality film styled thriller/documentary thing was amazing.  I loved that all the actors were speaking Norwegian and most of the cast was from there.  It made it seem more real.  I also loved that it was about a creature of folklore you rarely see in movies yet is one of the most famous.  It was a wild ride! Five stars.",Positive
"In episode #17 (part 1) listen for a bonus at the 2:26 mark, give or take a second.  That being said, Tom Baker's Dr. was the best until the new 2005-present series.  Historically in real time this is a 'post Star Wars' timeline.  Keeping to the look and feel of Dr. Who was getting lost as the 80's progressed but this is still in the good phase of the show's run.",Positive
"I do not usually like 'reality shows', but this one makes me laugh.  Very canned and scripted.  Good clean fun.",Negative

"This is an excellent mini-series that has a little bit of everything thrown into it: action, mystery, drama, suspense and romance. The set designs and production value are top notch. The overall story, presented in 6 parts (approx 45-50 minutes in length), clocks in at around 5 hours. It is a quick 5 hours that I will certainly return to and visit from time to time.Plot in a nutshell: late 1800's: after graduating college, two close friends decide to head west from Vermont to seek adventure and claim their future. They ultimately decide on venturing to the Yukon and trying their hand at the gold rush. The first hour or so is man versus nature as they attempt to reach the Klondike by battling the raw Alaskan elements. Finally, they reach their destination: Dawson City, a crowded town in the middle of nowehere with no law and no shortage of law breakers. From there, the two friends set off to claim a piece of land and start digging for gold. It doesn't take long to discover that while it is difficult to find any gold, it's even more difficult to keep it when you're surrounded by people who would cut your throat without blinking to take it for themselves.There are definite similarities between the residents of Dawson City and Deadwood. Yes, Deadwood is more hardcore and violent. That doesn't make Klondike any less entertaining.""Klondike"" has several sublots going with colorful and memorable characters: the aristrocratic Count who has no problem resorting to murder when money doesn't buy him what he wants; the preacher who must decide whether to flee the Counts' very real threats for his land, or stand up against him; the Constable / Superintendent who wants to bring law and order to Dawson City but finds himself in a no-win situation when corporate interests want to pin a murder on a handful of native indians the Constable knows to be innocent; the natives who clearly don't plan to stand by and watch their brethren be wrongfully hanged by a town of greedy outsiders; the beautiful but naive courtesan who figures she can make some money off her good looks but ends up in a much darker place than she had bargained for; the entreprenuer Belinda Mulrooney who will stand toe to toe with anyone in Dawson- including her arch rival, the villainous Count.My only 2 complaints are that there are so many subplots that could have served as main storylines, yet weren't as fully realized as they could have been. However, I guess that would have required a much longer-running mini-series to accomplish what simply cannot be done over 5 short hours.  My second complaint is that Conor Leslie, who portrays the courtesan Sabine, wasn't in every frame of the movie. She's drop dead gorgeous.Otherwise, ""Klondike"" is great and enjoyable entertainment at its best. If you have a fondness for historical fiction, then this gem of a mini-series is a must watch.",Positive

"I watched all of the six live action comedies and this one had the only LOL moment.  I was amused throughout the show but there is the potential for ""Betas"" to slip on it's one or two jokes: being an insecure 20 something genius, which it borrows from ""The Big Bang"".  And we certainly do not need another Jonah Hill type out there.  The themes of this show are not as timeless as the others and it has the potential of looking ""so 2010"".",Positive

It's different which is a nice change in television viewing. I will continue to watch it and hope that is kept true to the trans community.,Positive
"I can't understand they hype this film has received. I found it boring and lacking in plot. The special effects are fairly good, what there are of them (not much). There are supposedly several types of trolls, but viewers get to see only 2 types briefly. The filming pretty good quality, but there is little suspense as you know this is supposed to be found footage, thus the viewer knows from the start that the film crew didn't survive the super fast and confused attack at the end of the film.  I thought it was a fun idea to use the troll concept, but the idea was wasted. Most of the film is trying to locate living trolls, chasing the clues, and then there are the quick moments during which we actually see a troll. The CGI is good but goes by too quickly to enjoy. Rent this one.",Negative
Very good family watching. I loved the special effects and visuals. Cool concept. It makes me wonder if something similar exists in real life.,Positive

"This is the first time in many years I've loved a prime time TV series this much, and so much look forward to the next episode. King is such a fine writer, and he always creates such real and compelling characters that viewers are sure to identify with at least one or two of them. The show is expertly written, cast, directed, and edited.My only disappointment was in discovering that this is not really a miniseries as I expected, and will continue into another season or more. I've come to like the miniseries as the best way of dramatizing a novel, it allows plenty of time to fully tell a story with all of its subplots, and give us the &#34;back story&#34; on each character as needed - then wraps it all up nicely. I hope that what the writers intend to do is to extend the story beyond the novel's conclusion, rather than delay it. I haven't read the book so the end is a mystery to me, and I wouldn't be willing to wait for years (as with &#34;Lost&#34;, which this story resembles a little).",Positive
This show is quite unique and very different. This is the type of show that is interesting on many levels.  You get to like the charaters right away-and want to know more and more about them. The stories are thought-provoking and the BEST PART are the Easy to look at stars! There is one man that is so easy to dislike...he plays his part well.  5 star rating.  Check it out ladies!  You will want to stay up to watch the next episode...trust me.,Positive
"I am sorry to admit that I have only recently discovered this series, and that too by way of the remake, which is available via streaming as well. I was not sure what to expect with the original, but I had read glowing reviews of the show, and decided to give it a try (it didn't hurt that season one of this show was available free for download for Prime members, but alas, not the subsequent seasons).This show has an amazing cast, not to mention riveting plot lines. As a costume drama, it is pretty enough but due to the age of the show and the budget constraints back then, the production quality is not as great as contemporary period dramas such as seen on hit series Downton Abbey, the remake Upstairs, Downstairs and others. Some of the episodes in Season One are rendered in black and white instead of color due to a strike back then. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the show.The series ran for five seasons from 1971 to 1975. The primary setting for the show is 165 Eaton Place, a roomy townhouse, and the time frame spans Edwardian England, the First World War up till 1930. The series explores the lives of the upper-class Bellamy's (upstairs) and their servants (downstairs), and some of the themes covered during the show is the difference between the upper and lower classes, societal changes, marital strife, relationship problems, and the plight of the poor, among others.The Bellamy's are made up of Richard Bellamy, MP (portrayed by David Langton) and his wife, Lady Marjorie Bellamy (played by Rachel Gurney), and the couple have two children, James (Simon Williams) who is serving in the military, and strong-willed Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett).Meanwhile, the servants downstairs comprise competent and firm butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson); cook Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley); head house parlour maid Rose Buck (Jean Marsh, who returns in the remake and takes on the role of housekeeper); a footman, and a kitchen maid (and the occasional changes in secondary staff).I would advise those new to the show to begin by watching Season 1 first as there is much background to the characters and stories that can be better appreciated and understood if watching chronologically. Season Three is as intriguing as the previous two seasons though dark clouds hang over the Bellamy household. A terrible tragedy causes much strife and chaos in the Bellamy household. Son James falls in love with a woman not of his social class, and the staff downstairs are also experiencing problems of their own. Finances in the Bellamy household are tight this season and the residents of 165 Eaton Place are forced to economize, both upstairs and downstairs.This third season of the show sees a death in the family, a marriage, a murderer putting the lives of the residents of 165 Eaton in danger, and the possibility of romance! The writing as always is engaging, and the plot lines keep me riveted to the screen! I am hopelessly addicted to this show now, and the new remake truly can't compare to the writing and acting in the original!Forget the insipid shows that pass off as entertainment these days - I'll have a cuppa and watch these over any day!",Positive
I watched X-Files and loved it.  Until the end.  Kinda dropped the ball on the back story. The individual stories were much more interesting and fun to watch. But this show The After definitely has that Chris Carter feel to it.  I just hope he doesn't layer the mysteries so deep that in the end you get too much dumped on you because the writer(s) ran out of time with the series.  So far so good. Very entertaining. Please continue the series.  I can't wait to see more.  And for those of you who are so offended by the language and the ADULT content...watch Animal Planet or Disney Channel.,Positive
"A very well written show.  I was more than a little sorry to see it end. I'm sure there were more good stories to tell.  The actors were 'real' although some of the story lines were a bit fantastic, but we can read the newspapers for the 'real' stuff.",Positive

"The premise of the show would be interesting; the regular every day struggles of the First Family, a blended family, at that. It has potential......but it's just over the side of too silly. It could be closer to okay ~without~ the Skip character. I know Gad is one of the creators, but that character is what puts the show beyond the pale of watchable.I find I enjoy the sequences with all of the other characters, even in the slapstick, ""Oh, please, that wouldn't happen,"" moments, but as soon as Skip comes on camera, I check my text messages until he goes away again.There could be a balance between what would actually happen if the POTUS had a goofy frat boy son living in the White House, and this degree of absurdity. But they've missed that balance. It's just too silly.",Negative
"Elementary is one of my favorite TV shows.  The episodes are fun and interesting.  This season (2), the writers are focusing more on character and background development, so I miss the unique crime solving process Holmes had in Season 1.  The writing is still among the best on TV now, so I don't mind the slight change much at all.  It's one of the few shows I pay for and download if I miss a week.",Positive
"I like this because of them introducing new characters and the old ones are taking on new plots.  I liked the first season very much and although this season is very much like the first, it does not take away from suspense and romance that is built in as the main idea of the show.",Positive

"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MississippiThat's Foley's (Samuel L. Jackson) new monto, ""Nothing changes unless you make it change.""&#8200;He should know. He's spent the last 25 years in prison for killing his partner and best friend,Up until that moment he was one of the best grifters around. He had business savvy and knew how to work a con the smart way.Now that he's finally getting out, Foley is determined to change.But there's a problem. Ethan (Luke Kirby) the son of his former partner wants to be a grifter, he wants to learn from the best and he won't take ""no"" for an answer.He's got a mark, his boss Xavier (Tom Wilkinson) and claims with Foley's help they can take him for eight million.Foley has met a young woman Iris (Ruth Negga) and feels he's got a real chance of leaving his old life behind. Ethan won't give up and finally get's his way, when he forces Iris into the mix.The Samaritan is an OK&#8200;movie, that could have been a great movie. It has two major things going for it. First, Samuel L. Jackson - the way he rolls his eyes, that road-weary persona, that determination not to go back to jail but a necessary convincing flip-flop when they include the woman he loves. Second, The Samaritan is a good con movie. You constantly find yourself trying to figure out who is conning who, or if anyone can be trusted at all.The downside is the film tries to balance too many themes in 90 minutes, worth a look but forgettable.",Negative

"Love the show bc it shows real estate agents who are extremely professional and smart. Anyone who has an agent half as good as these are, he is golden. They work very hard to sell, sell, sell and they make great ambassadors for their industry. Now they spoiled it for all the other agents... they will look dull, predictable, incompetent in extreme cases. California should pay the producer money for portraying LA and Beverly Hills, Malibu etc under such beautiful light. The houses are to die for.. well except a few that should get their decoration license revoked. But still, the majority is a lesson in taste and architecture. I wish this show went on for a whole year! My fav realtor is Josh Altman, he seems to fight the hardest to get the best deal for his customers. I would absolutely hire him in a heartbeat. For Malibu I would hire Madison bc he is simply the sweetest soul caught in a world of wolves AND he is very good at his job too =)",Positive

"The disaster of the city of Pompeii took place in the year 79 AD and has really become more of a tragic legend than fact.  Although historians are aware of the time frame in which the volcano, Mount Vesuvius, erupted &#8211; along with having some names of people that died in the catastrophe &#8211; that&#8217;s really all they know.  With that in mind, the imagination and fictitious accounts make up the storyline for the period adventure flick, Pompeii.Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat) directs the epic, Pompeii &#8211; starring Kit Harington as Milo.  As a young boy, Milo watched as the Romans slaughtered his people (and parents), led by a dastardly soldier, Corvus (Kiefter Sutherland).  Although Milo survived the attack, he was captured and thrown into slavery, eventually becoming a lethal gladiator.  In fact, he&#8217;s so lethal that his master, Graecus (Joe Pingue), decides to move him to a grander stage in the city of Pompeii.On the way to Pompeii, the lives of Milo and a wealthy merchant&#8217;s daughter, Cassia (Emily Browning), become intertwined.  Shortly thereafter, Milo learns he must fight Pompeii&#8217;s gladiator champion, Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) &#8211; but prior to their showdown, the two men form a surprising and unsuspecting friendship.  At the same time, the man that killed Milo&#8217;s family, Corvus, comes to town and is now a well-respected (and feared) Roman senator.Corvus has been looking for Cassia (whom he desperately wants to marry) and quickly notices the growing bond that has formed between Cassia and Milo.  In an effort to dispose of Milo, Corvus puts both Atticus and Milo in the Pompeii coliseum for the fight of their lives &#8211; a fight in which they are sure to lose their lives.  However, without any warning, a volcano outside the city erupts thrusting everyone into a panic as the sky rains with fire and ash.For the fans of the popular film, Gladiator, the plot of Pompeii will appear to be extremely familiar.  Both feature a storyline that is driven by revenge after the death of the main character&#8217;s family.  But, Pompeii is certainly no Gladiator and the fact that both films are being used in the same sentence is borderline outrageous.  Still, it&#8217;s hard to ignore the similarities between the two movies &#8211; prompting Pompeii to easily be labeled as a dreaded Gladiator &#8220;knockoff.&#8221;Kit Harington, who is most recognizable from his starring role in the popular HBO drama, Game of Thrones, plays a character that we&#8217;ve seen countless times in the past &#8211; and again is much like the lead character in Gladiator (although Harington is a far cry from the masterful Russell Crowe).  Milo is cold as ice on the outside, but clearly filled with righteous emotions on the inside.  He&#8217;s been driven by revenge his whole life, but once he lays his eyes on the beautiful &#8220;princess,&#8221; suddenly his heart melts and he has new meaning to live.If you happen to be a fan of Jon Snow (Harington&#8217;s Game of Thrones character), then you should find just as much enjoyment in the Milo character.  Harington literally looks like he walked of the set of Game of Thrones and jumped right into Pompeii.  In fact, the two characters are so similar that it will be almost impossible to tell them apart.  Unfortunately, it&#8217;s difficult to determine whether or not that&#8217;s a good thing or a bad thing.  Really, the only bothersome part of Harington&#8217;s character in Pompeii is that it&#8217;s filled with far too many holes since viewers will have no idea what happened to the character from childhood to adulthood &#8211; although one could assume he was constantly in chains.The main character depth issue, which plagues many films that have previously attempted to do too much in too little time &#8211; evident in films like John Carter and Prince of Persia, also hampers Pompeii.  Several lead characters, like Emily Browning&#8217;s Cassia or Kiefer Sutherland&#8217;s Corvus, are nothing more than randomly in the wrong place at the wrong time &#8211; sort of like anyone that was aboard the Titanic.  Sadly, the ambitions of these two vague, aloof characters are never fully realized, and are poorly reduced to taking part in an under whelming love triangle.Storyline aside, the CGI is also an issue that takes away from the film.  For roughly the first half of the film, the actors are mostly able to avoid the dreaded green screen.  However, as the volcano begins to erupt and the coliseum fighting ensues, the CGI becomes unbearably frequent &#8211; and is about as believable as the CGI used in Paul W. S. Anderson&#8217;s Resident Evil films.  If you&#8217;ve sat through other disaster flicks, like 2012 or Armageddon, then Pompeii will give off a similar feeling of disappointment with the over abuse of computer graphics.Overall, Pompeii is a film that will appeal more to Game of Thrones lovers and moviegoers that enjoy gladiator tales.  The story is far from unique, but that doesn&#8217;t stop it from being a semi-entertaining adventure flick.  It progresses at an intense pace and features plenty of action (even though most of it is noticeably fake).  Everlasting love is apparently the theme of the story, but by the time the credits roll, I suspect most viewers will feel as though they wasted their time watching a film that is filled with nothing more than death, disappointment, and shattered expectations.  $100 million is far too much to spend of the movie of this nature and even though it is an average &#8220;popcorn&#8221; film, the disappointing finale will leave the majority of viewers uttering, &#8220;that&#8217;s it?&#8221;GRADE:  C-FNDNreview.com",Negative

"Loved looking at, and hearing ""Alyssa Milano"" since the very first ""CHARMED"" episode. So, once this flick began with her name and face showing up, it was going to be a bearable agony if the story-line was not pleasing. Surprise! Actually, the only difficult part was that I wasn't her character's love interest.Easily a warming, while mildly complex romantic melodrama well filmed; crystal clear, good sound, with a theme that is ages old [boy meets girl, girl meets boys] including a tryst and a twist that places ""MY GIRLFRIEND'S BOYFRIEND"" in a category with the Olde Days' movies that ""Katherine Hepburn"", ""Spencer Tracy"", ""Cary Grant"" and ""Lauren Bacall"" made.Putting aside my personal desires, ""Alyssa Milano"" provides a much broader look into her talents and craft, tossing aside that playful youthful persona when necessary, allowing the Viewer to see the more adult maturity that is probably closer in actual realistic proximity to her physical nature. I'm not very big on Love Stories, but this is a nice one---easy on the eyes, brain and heart...  ---GBJ",Positive
"This series is a joy to watch.  Not only is Anthony Bourdain a gratious and sincere host, but he is unstoppable in his quest for new places to visit and new foods to eat.  Don't know how he does it!",Positive
"A deeply oddball, and pretty entertaining low budget mash-up of character study, humor, and metaphysical horror.  It&#8217;s not like anything you&#8217;ve seen before, but it achieves that effect by taking a LOT of elements you&#8217;ve seen before, and having fun combining them in novel ways.A young guy  - Michael - who seems to have his life pretty together goes out to try and save his depressed, meth-head, gun loving friend &#8211; Chris &#8211; who is living alone in the middle of the woods.  The unanswered question of who took the video of this Chris acting so crazy sets the tone for this film full of unexplained weirdness that creates a generally tense and creepy atmosphere despite any clear resolution to many of the questions (that's only one of several meanings the pun-laden title seems to have).Much of the film is the relationship between these two men, and how Chris reacts to being forced to go cold turkey after Michael handcuffs him to a wall pipe.  Both the acting and dialogue wavers between fun, honest, touching and a touch amateurish.  Chris has one of the easier, least believable sudden withdrawals from serious addition I can remember seeing on film.  But this film doesn&#8217;t seem too worried about being real.  It seems far more interested in being entertaining and leaving you wondering just what things mean; that old, creepy photo, the escapee from a local loony bin who knocks on the window at night, the fact that they are on Indian lands with a bad history.  Do these things mean anything?  Or do we just assume they do from a lifetime of horror and suspense films?  The film-makers aren&#8217;t always saying, they want us to wonder for ourselves&#8230; and to smile while we shiver just a bit.  I&#8217;ll be curious to watch this again.  It seems like a repeat viewing will either reveal its shallowness or uncover hidden depths&#8230;",Positive

"She really enjoyed the show and wanted more.  As a parent I have to say that graphics could be better in today's competitive children animation world.  This looks like amateur work.  Tumblelaf and Postively Ozitively are examples of great animation work.  Also I struggled a little as a parent with the bad kid vs. good kid dynamic in this show.  If the target audience is toddlers 3-5, not sure this is something that I would like a kid's show to reinforce.  I would hope that this is not a recurring theme or concept for the show.  Solving math problems is a great concept but please no bad kids vs good kids dynamic.  There are only naughty kids at these ages.",Positive
"I like Brooklyn 99. Its enjoyable to watch, but I also don't really understand the 5 star reviews either. There are two issues that I have with it. The first is that I wish it was a hour long show versus the current half hour, which ends up really being about 22 minutes. There is only so much you can do in 22 minutes and I can feel it every time I watch an episode. Its hard to develop characters or a story with a limited amount of time. My other issue is that it tries to be a little too corny and amusing. I like comedies, but it feels like they are trying to make every second of Brooklyn 99 amusing which tends to actually make it work less. There have been moments when I actually wished characters would be a little more serious. Overall its a fun show to watch, but I don't know if it was interesting enough for me to bother with season 2. You are also paying the same thing to rent a half hour episode on amazon that you would pay for other hour long shows. Most reviews really like the show, but it only partially worked for me.",Negative

These people are horrid, but their story is interesting.  It is a depiction of poverty, and people living in coal country that live off the government SSI systems due to their mental illness.  They are crazy, take drugs, their children are hooligans, some are in jail/prison.  You just can't look away from this train wreck.  It reminded me of the show Justified, but this is reality for these people.",Negative
"While watching this movie, I was disappointed in places but I kept watching and was glad I did. I liked it much more after I thought about the plot and the underlying meaning.If you are looking for a fast-paced film - look elsewhere because this one isn't it. Take This Waltz takes a long time to get going. At first, instead of building momentum, we are presented with a bunch of quirky characters (Sarah Silverman, for example) who seem to just wander aimlessly around in life. But once the main characters, played Michelle Williams, decides what she is going to do, the movie picks up and the pieces start to fall in place.I agree with some other reviewers that parts of the film are way too slow and that sometimes the characters seem unrealistic. But that is part of the beauty in the film. Some people do not have direction in their lives and because of that are drawn to whatever or whomever helps give them some excitement. Unfortunately, those same people often do not bother to think about the consequences of their actions until it's too late. As one lady says in the shower scene, ""new eventually gets old.""Now, Michelle Williams's character will annoy you to no end because she's always crying and is way too timid in her marriage. But Seth Rogen's character isn't without his flaws either.  And the actor who plays Daniel (Michelle Williams's admirer) is just as much a loser as the rest of them.I wouldn't recommend that you pay full price to view Take This Waltz, but if it's only $2 or so, it would be a good movie to have playing in the background as you clean your room or to watch while playing Scrabble.",Negative
"I was hooked after the first two or three shows. I watched this until seasons end, and waited anxiously to begin season two. What I found was the same story lines over and over. The same disappointments over and over, with the exact same characters.I was also tired of seeing the Christian characters played as WAYYYYY over the top, and the Pagan as wise, calm and all knowing. It got old fast! I watched a little of season three, finding the exact same story line AGAIN! UGH I just couldn't watch anymore.",Negative

"To go along with all this cheesy acting.I didn't think the first season was all that great but I thought it had potential and would pickup so I watched it to the end. I have seen every single last episode of this series to date and I'm not sure Why I gave it the benefit of the doubt. It goes from ""Okay,to Interesting, to Good, to Terrible, to Great, to Completely Awful"" and that seems to be the episode cycle with this series. The balance of story writing and acting ability is never consistent with this show. Sometimes there's a really good episode and then one that is a complete flop. It's as though each episode has a different writer like this is a series of short stories all by different authors. Some time you hate you missed the show and sometimes you wish you didn't waste your time to watch it all. Then complied into that is the acting, and how bad it is. There are maybe but a handful of ""good"" actors on this show and they are all Villians. With the exception of Mulan just about everyone else makes you want to cringe at the way they deliver their lines. It's as though Uwe Boll is directing this show. The acting is completely all over the place.For starters Seeing less Henry and more story started to make this show seem more promising and then came season 2. Not only is Henry all over the place but as usual he is the most annoying character on the show. I get it this kids supposed to be a key character but his acting is awful in every scene which makes watching him just make you shake your head and hope the scene ends soon. Whether the writers have him doing some stupid and pointless idea or if he's just running around town nagging people with the same ""I want to help"", ""your a story book character"" it just gets old and quick. Why and I mean WHY would you give the worst actor on your show the most screen time? This kids acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like Kevin Costner! and I know ""he's just a kid"" yeah and a terrible actor. I wouldn't cared much or have said much if they didn't cram this kids in your face every 5 minutes into the show. No matter what the story is as soon as this kid appears it's ruined. I don't even understand this kids story. So what if his adoptive mother is an evil witch. She's nicer than 99.9% of the mothers out there.Unlike his real mother she didn't abandon him and actually wants to be his mother. I mean think about it she feeds him well, buys him toys to play with, drives him to school, takes him out eat, I mean what the heck. She's a great mother but this kid can't stop complaining about her. For what? Pampering and spoiling him? Worse thing she ever did was try to show him how to use magic. If this show stuck to the point and didn't jump back and fourth to this pointless Henry Mills side story it would probably be worth watching. Instead I just find myself looking to spend an hour doing something else before TWD comes on.and by all means do bring the thumbs down. Hate the idea that someone sees this series for what it is.

The show is very well done, and there are several episodes that I thought were particularly entertaining (some good laughs).  The corpses sometimes are still very graphic, gross and disgusting, and sometimes things get a little too technical, but it is still an excellent show.This DVD set has several extras and it does have subtitles for the hearing impaired.  I hope the quality of the show continued in the other seasons, which I am looking forward to watching.  (I do not have cable or satellite, and only buy DVD's.)",Positive

"OK, so Chris Carter is behind this; that's no guarantee of quality. The action sequences are well done, and the premise isn't bad, but as is so often the case with science-fiction/horror, the characters are stereotypical and do really unbelievable things. At the beginning of this, five people are stuck in an elevator. What would you do if you got stuck in an elevator? Would you, within two or three minutes, begin to panic and think about climbing out the hatch in the ceiling? I doubt it; I think you'd be patient a bit longer than that. But not these people. They immediately begin to panic. And their default mode of communicating with each other? Sniping and carping, of course, because that's the way cardboard characters behave in way too many mediocre screenplays. No one behaves reasonably when they can instead immediately begin to criticize and judge each other. It's just the same kind of characters we've seen in a thousand other movies -- whether Chris Carter is behind them or not.",Negative

"I can see why the producers would show this pilot unfinished. Why go to the trouble of finishing a pilot when you do not even know if it will be an on-going series? I can say that, after watching it, I could see the potential in going forward with this show. Even though it wasn't finished, I still appreciated the variety of animation styles and could see how stop-motion would actually help it be funnier and more enjoyable. I enjoyed the characters, though they were a little too clich&eacute;d for me. I see a lot of people comparing this pilot to ""The Office,"" but I really didn't get that vibe too much to point of irritation. I liked the voice acting, too. The writing could have been a little less drug-culture influenced, but the cheeky nerdiness worked. The designs were very good. Why should ""Mary Shelly's Frankenhole"" be the only stop-motion animation show currently on the air (I think). I know IFC has one coming soon, but we need more of these types of animation shows. My only complaint was that the one female character was not in it enough. If this goes to series, I would like to see more of her. I see room for growth, but most of the kinks seemed to have been worked out.",Positive
"Terrific show which just got better as the season progressed. Not just a nostalgia trip to the 80's or a good spy tale, although it is, but a very interesting sand perceptive look at what it takes to make a marriage work. Highly recommend.",Positive
"I would definetely like to see where this show is going. I thought the end was a bit wierd, and unexpected. I could have continued to be interested without that twist. Some good actors. Could do without the nudity, certainly not necessary. And the over use of the &#34;f' word.",Positive
"This show was so creative - interesting and imaginative story, great acting and production.  Loved it and would love to see more!",Positive
"This season did not get my attentions as did season one and two.I think it may have ran it's course, we will see.",Negative
"This series is just fun to watch.  I like all the main characters, find the plot lines okay, and will stick with it throughout it's run.",Positive
"Informing and entertaining.  Yeah, they are a bunch of barbarians but they're interesting bunch.  If you liked GOT, or 300, give it a try!",Positive
Love this show !!!!!!!!!!!! The story lines keep u interested !!!!!!!!!!! The actors r great and so easy on the eyes for females and male audience !!!!!!!!!!,Positive
intriguing ...entertaining ...great story lines....lawyers ..... maybe not a lawyer....deals no deals ...negotiate.....twisted  ....legal shady...NO deals.....and finally one very important word.....DONNA,Positive
"You've got to be in just the right mood to watch this movie.  It's not a blockbuster, an epic saga, or super troopers--it's real, it's charming, it's funny, it's slow and it's characters are lovely to watch.  This movie feels like the ending of a good, long book where all the loose ends are leisurely tied up.  The sound during dialogue had some odd parts, but that aside, it was a nicely done movie.  Ireland is breath-taking, and the eldest son wasn't bad to look at either.  The music and the score made the movie, carried it.  Truly.  Soundtrack, please.",Positive
Dickens  writing reflects the darker side of humanity but also the redemptive power of love and kindness.  This story stays true to that formula.  Portrayal of all the characters in this story is very well done by many of my personal favorites.  Clare Foy and Matthew MacFadyen are excellent.  Judy Parfitt is brilliant in her role and Andy Sirkus is creepy and despicable which is what he does best.  My husband did not want to watch this at all but quickly found it interesting and intriguing.If you appreciate all things British I highly recommend your investment of time.,Positive
"Excellent show with the feel of the era, excellent plot and acting.  The BBC is always great and them doing a show on themselves in the past is truly fascinating to us across the pond.",Positive
I can't wait for the next season ..I hope they didn't cancel it! As it's the only show similar to Desperate Housewives (but lil more funny),Positive
The staple of the b-rate sci-fi horror film? Spiders. Giant Radioactive Spiders. The MST3K crew riffs this one quite well.,Positive
Nice little twist on people forced into having to rely on each other whether they want to or not.  The character study is rather good and you can never be too sure who is going to still be around for the following week's episode.,Positive
"My wife and I had the same reaction to Justified Season 2 as we did to the first season - we are hooked. Great drama, exceptional acting, and compelling directing and writing. One of our favorite series ever!",Positive
"Little Bill continues to exemplify what a good, educational children's program should be. I only wish that it was still running.",Positive
"As an adult, I really enjoyed the story line and characters....my kids in 6th grade and 2nd grade, liked the story too....acknowledging and embracing imagination into a reality and show that kids can really handle things!  Smart kids with heart and inquisitive minds!  I can't wait for the next episode and my kids keep bugging me on when the next one is coming!!!  Please hurry and make/post another episode!",Positive
"It takes a veteran movie star - with name recognition - to gather as many A-list movie directors for a project like this and in this case actor Keanu Reeves fills that role brilliantly. As you will see by the many previous reviews posted here (all based on the Amazon Instant Video streaming version) this is a ""film"" - and I use that word cautiously here - about the move to ""digital"" from celluloid. Like the move from vinyl (and before that shellac) records to CDs and digital downloads for music, there is a strong debate as to whether the benefit of cheaper- and less time consuming - processes are better. New digital cameras are MUCH lighter and more portable and the digital images can be modified. But there is a loss in some of the ""reality"" of the images.  And, as for preservation, we are not sure how long the equipment - constantly changing - will survive. I won't get into that debate as this is not the place. And I won't repeat a lot of what others have provided as info in their reviews. I'll concentrate on the DVD home release.Reeves acts not only as the Producer of this ""film"" but does nearly all the on screen interviews. His questions are always insightful since he is in the business and has worked with many of the Directors, Cinematographers (now called DPs - for Director of Photography), and Editors. And he doesn't take sides.The front of the package lists SEVEN well known directors (Cameron, Fincher,Lucas,Lynch,Rodrigues.Scorsese, Soderberg - was Tarrantino busy?) You know all these names. But - couting the credits - there are 67 more interviewees (!) in this 99-minute documentary. These folks are ones you'd only know if you stayed for final credits after watching a movie.  The ""film"" explains the changes in cameras beginning in the 1990s and concentrating on the 2004-2006 period when Sony and Panovision and Red changed the playing field, so to speak.You will hear George Lucas defend digital while Scorsese is sticking to film - for its use as an archival medium.Yes, it gets a bit too technical for the casual movie goer but not that technical. Again, it's Reeves' questions that keep the doc flowing.The BluRay Disc looks great on even a standard non-HD TV. There are two bonus features: The first consists of four deleted scenes which total just 2  minutes; the other contains and addition 12 interviews (total time of this is 13 minutes).So I'd recommend this to anyone interest in the film industry, technology or film preservation.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",Positive
I love good crime drama with great scripting and plot content.  This met my standard very well indeed.  I hope it has more seasons to come!!,Positive
Better than most the Amazon Crap Shows. None should be made into series. This one was at least half amusing.,Negative
"With all the success that AMC has had recently turning out high quality adult programs such as ""Mad Men"" and ""The Walking Dead,"" few new dramas in 2011 were as eagerly anticipated as their Western revival ""Hell on Wheels."" Despite a somewhat mixed reaction from the mainstream media, the show was an instant hit when its premiere episode became the network's second highest rated debut in history. And yet, despite these big numbers and impeccable production values, it is still very much a show that is finding its way creatively and dramatically. There are so many reasons to recommend ""Hell on Wheels"" and yet it takes a while to find its footing after a powerhouse beginning. For most of its ten episodes, I found myself admiring the show's technical construction as opposed to loving its storytelling arc.The two strongest components of the show (evident from the very beginning) were its lavish depiction of the Old West with some spectacular battles and effects and a dynamic lead villain in Colm Meaney. The story opens in a post-Civil War America with an enigmatic soldier (Anson Mount) seeking revenge for the murder of his wife by Union officers. His journey puts him in the heart of a railroad construction project led by Meaney at an untamed post on the outskirts of civilization. There are working girls, disgraced clergy, thuggish bosses, newly emancipated slaves, a Native American presence and a myriad of other unscrupulous business types coexisting in this tempestuous microcosm and seeking to exploit the new possibilities on the road west. Meaney is absolutely terrific and other notable performances are turned in by Common (unexpectedly solid as a sometimes ally of Mount) and Tom Noonan (as a preacher trying to reform his life). While the entire cast is quite good, some of the peripheral characters have yet to be developed in any meaningful way.There is no denying that ""Hell on Wheels"" is a handsome and extremely well executed from a technical standpoint. From the sets to the costumes to the effects, there are some pretty spectacular action set pieces and period recreations. It's obvious that many people love ""Hell on Wheels."" I wished I had been more emotionally connected to the earlier episodes, it took about half of the season before I felt really invested. After that, though, I really loved much of what came next. There are so many strong elements at work here--I was willing to be patient. The skeleton for a improved second season is in place. As long as the show digs deeper into its characterizations, there's no reason to think it can't develop into one of TV's best dramas. Not fully cooked and sometimes relies on too many cliches, but it has enormous potential. And it sure does look great! KGHarris, 5/12.",Positive
I have long been a fan of British police dramas as well as the dry English wit (notwithstanding Monty Python & company).  The set period lends itself well to demonstrating the less than enthusiastic welcome to women in a male dominated profession.  Excellent acting by all.,Positive
"This story looks to be amazing, the plot obviously will allow for stories back in time and over previous lives.  The witches theme will actually be refreshing if Lifetime does not start making political statements into the plots as happens with some of their other shows.  When will the Hollywood types realize we want entertainment, not subtle kudos for their favorite causes.Watch the preview and decide for yourself but to me this has the potential for being great entertainment.This looks good, I already signed up for a season long TV Pass so I certainly hope it is as good as it appears on the surface.The pilot was great but I should warn you that if you plan to watch the first episode you will actually need the first two episodes since the pilot ends on a bit of a cliffhanger but the story is riveting.UPDATE: 24 OCT 2013 - Well to be honest I am seriously considering dropping this show, the plots are OK at best and seem to be trending towards a soap opera type storyline.  I am going to give it a couple more episodes and see where it goes, so far it is not what I had hoped for and as another reviewer has said, it does indeed seem to be a reboot of Charmed in many ways but not as good.  I will leave the 5 Stars up for now but it is a fading thing for me.UPDATE: 13 Nov 2013 - I tried to love it but it was just not enough of a story to hold me, I cancelled my TV Pass for this, maybe if I read it got substantially better I will pick it up again but it had great potential that was just not realized.",Negative
"Whoa.  I mean lets be honest, as far as characters go, as far as episode plot lines and mysteries go, and as far as thematic material goes, lie to me has always been good.  Even if it's not your cup of tea.  Acting has been spot on.  Writing has been brisk and entertaining.News flash: it just got real.All of the characters have been fleshed out to the point that now we see some conflict amongst them and not just between them and episode villains.  This is where a lot of shows balk, screw up, choke.  Not here.  And neither do the writers take the show in a direction unwanted with that conflict.  Well done.Also they increase my respect in the area of new blood.  While they are introducing strife into the protagonist party, they are also introducing us to new characters.  No half-assery here.  Not only are any new characters interesting and believable they are entertaining. Well done.And best of all in my opinion, the mark of a truly great thing.  They keep the main hooks in place.  Many things change to much and loose the audience they had and do little to gain a new one (i'm speaking of anything here: Books, movies, tv shows, video games).  Many things try to hard to keep what they had and bore the audience they have.  The balance is a shy creature that many fail to capture.Lie To Me catches the little guy smoothly without missing a beat.  Insightful, entertaining change with loyalty to hooks that captured our hearts in the beginning.Well done.",Positive
Another show I thought I'd give a try thanks to a free episode from Amazon.  A very intriguing show that doesn't hold anything back and is fun to watch.  Keep it coming.  I look forward to each new episode.  Well done!,Positive
"It was very interesting to see how difficult it was for everyday, modern people to step back into that age of strict class distinction.  Obviously, the 'upper house' family had it a bit easier, although the strict formality of their daily lives had to be so different and difficult for them to maintain and feel like 'themselves'.  A wonderful and interesting experiment I would have loved to be a part of....as the Lady of the house of course.  If you're a Downton Abbey or any of those kinds of programs fan, you should enjoy this as I did.",Positive
I am totally hooked - just love this show - just the right amount of good and bad guys -add more seasons amazon :),Positive
Characters are getting better.  Storyline is always better. The same people are  the best actors.  They draw you in and hypnotize you.  Love Kim Coates and Tommy Flanaghan.  Have watched their careers on different shows. They are emerging as the best of actors.  Can't wait every week till the show comes on.  One of my favorite shows on cable television.,Positive
"Loved this film. Was not boring. Had a list celebs, actors etc. Very informative, funny, awakening, alarming, factual and truthful. I actually after watching this wished it was like an hour longer or more in depth. I was left wanting more. I really think they did a good job on this film. I just wish the government actually helped society as a whole. They are supposed to be the general populations trusted decision makers and wise leaders. Turns out they are leading our nation to ruin. Public outcry, the truth, and God will win this war for us. The only question is how long? Godbless~shauns movie review",Positive
"I own the first Dallas from the 80's and was reluctant to watch the new one because I didn't think it could be topped. I was and still am a huge fan. Thank you TNN for bringing back a classic with superb story telling, expert casting and actors. The entire team is to be commended for great television.",Positive
This a a well document series which is both informative and entertaining.The challenges faced in the wild are both eye-opening and frightful.Very well done.,Positive
This man has transformed so many characters with personalities and voices to match that it makes for an extremely entertaining show.,Positive
"I was crazy addicted to this series at first, but then there are these episodes, with too much conversation and not enough action.",Negative
"My God! Is there any way to see this show uncensored?  This really sucks with BLEEP! BLEEP! every 30 seconds -- and the bleeps are LOUD.  In the UK, their 'F' and 'S' words are NOT censored.  AND you can buy other Hell's Kitchen DVDs and they are all uncensored.  The constant bleeping really takes away from enjoying this show.  I was going to wait until this came out in DVD (uncensored).  But I like Gordon Ramsay so much that I could not wait the full year before this show is released on DVD (uncensored).  I'm not sure if I'm going to finish watching this.",Negative
"I understand that it's difficult for some cultures to wean off, or even call grains, sugars, legumes, etc., as NON HUMAN FOODS. Of course, the evidence is there. Our genetic build had over 2 million years of time to perfect itself with the Paleolithic diet.As argued in this documentary, in the last 10,000 years we have altered the course of our diets dramatically. It is no mystery that this grain-boom led to dense civilizations, with the capacity to feed the masses at a low cost.Eating Paleo is NOT cheap, never has been and never will be. Either in the supermarket, grass fed beef is expensive, or hunting it with your hands in the wild, you will always pay a higher price. Nevertheless, as stated in this documentary, ""the inconvenience of health is not even half as inconvenient as chronic diseases"".The truth is chronic diseases are chewing up civilized societies--diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, cardiovascular health mishaps, etc. The solution, as argued in another review, is not well proposed in this documentary. Of course, sustaining a 13 million city based only on a Paleo diet WILL be challenge (if it ever happens).",Positive
"If you love watching puppies and kittens(and who doesn't) you will like this.  However, it can get to be too much after a while.",Positive
The show keeps you thinking and and extremely entertained. It is fresh and the interaction between the characters is very good.,Positive
Exciting and great rapport between Jeremy and Amber. This series was on TV for only a year which was a shame because it was well done.,Positive
"The movie has many moments from happy to sad.............also loved the story line.  Of course, Donald Sutherland is a fantastic actor.  I was surprised as I did not know what to expect.  Very entertaining!  Held my interest all the way.  Definitely recommend.",Positive
"Love the plot, the characters, twists. Keeps u at the edge of your seat. As for me, kept me up till 6am! That being said, I finished 3 seasons in 4 days. I'm in love with Fitz. I love Olivia. This is on the top of my list with GOT, Breaking Bad and Dexter. Keep 'em coming! :)",Positive
It was ok.  It had some educational value relating to different types of art.  I would probably let my kids watch it but probably not my first choice,Negative
"First of all...terrible movie. Second why 2 stars? Simply because of Nolan Funk, I am not sure how such a talented actor got involved in this but it seems he tried his best with what was given him. I believe that even the best actors can be brought down by working with seriously inferior actors, which brings us to Lindsay Lohan, who really thought she was a good idea? it is a barely passable movie, it may have been possible it could have been ok with someone else. She cries (no tears) she purses here lips? her face looks stuck. Moving on now..James Deen, former porn star for real, tried his best too but he seemed like a piece of cardboard, I believe he may get better, but please don't use this film on your resume! Bad dialog and a bad and not very interesting story and I still don't know how I watched it all...oh yeah, Nolan Funk,  I do like him a lot.",Negative
"This was a good family movie, it was funny and kinda predictable but what family movie isn't acting was okay good enough",Positive
Great kick assl,Positive
I signed up for this series because it is one of the few tv programs (other than sports) that my husband really enjoys.  Now I can have it on hand and stream it to the tv any time he complains about 'nothing decent on tv tonight'.  This makes us both happy.,Positive
"TV News is easy to make fun of but Onion steps it up a notch. A nice mix of weird but nearly believable characters who try to keep Onion going by finding the most farfetched stories and presenting them as the news. The ""headlines"" reporting is funny and is a highlight. View Onion as a cross between Broadcast News and the newsroom scenes from Superman. Not sure they have given the brilliant Jeffrey Tambor enough to do so far at least. Given the fast pace and sheer absurdity they may achieve the holy grail of this kind of comedy - the immortal Airplane.",Negative
"I don't consider myself a big Sci-fi person however this show is a must see. Tech is cool, guys are not bad to look at and the story line is actually not far-fetched. So, almost human on!",Positive
"So glad the fans stayed on them to make a movie, which I did watch as well. The actors are great, the stories as well. I hope they make another movie in a couple years to catch us up with them again.",Positive
"I've loved this show from the first episode of the first season. It takes true genius to make a viewer root for a villain. Of course, now Walt has totally lost sight of his original goal, and I don't think anyone is on his side! After all of the dirty deeds he's committed, he can't simply go back to living a normal life. This first episode of Season 6 proves that.He tries to quietly leave the fast-paced, unpredictable drug dealing life he's created, but now his brother-in-law Hank has learned of his true involvement. To say Hank is pissed would be an understatement. He punches Walt in the jaw and basically gets buck wild on him. At first, Walt tries to deny the accusation that he's really Heisenberg, but when Hank keeps pushing, Walt tells him he'd better tread lightly!Also, Walt's partner in crime, Jesse is having a melt-down. He wants nothing more to do with the millions of dollars in cash he has laying around in duffle bags. He refers to it as drug money (hence the name of this episode - Blood Money). So, he roams the streets in his car tossing out bundles of cash to people in disadvantaged neighborhoods. His progression from small-time hood to big-time gangster back to contrite criminal is an amazingly wild ride. I almost feel sorry for him. Almost.I'd always believed that Walt would end up going to prison and possibly dying there trying to run his business from behind bars. But now that his Cancer is back and he's left the drug game, there could be a different ending. I'm excited to see how this last season will progress. The acting is superb and the plot is always fresh. In my opinion, this is the second-best show on TV, right behind The Walking Dead. AMC has some talented writers. I've been watching Breaking Bad, TWD, Hell on Wheels, and now I just started watching Low Winter Sun - which follows Breaking Bad. I hope it's just as good. If you haven't seen this series, give it a chance. It's a hell of a show.",Positive
"If you are a big fan of 1950s crime fiction Los Angeles, this series is for you.  Frank Darabont weaves a great fictional yarn surrounding the real Bugsy Siegel and Mickey Cohen.  A photographer with blackmail (played by Simon Pegg), a cop scarred by World War 2 (Jon Berenthal), a femme fatale (Alexa Devaros), and the LA police chief William Parker (Neal McDonough).  Another standout is Robert Knepper who plays Siegel's right hand man Sid Rothman.  Knepper's been very good in every TV series he has been on, but this particular role & director allows him to give a stellar performance.  The directing and cinematography are equally outstanding, many of the shots had me doing a quick rewind.  I loved this from beginning to end...I just hope TNT renews it for a full season or someone else (Netflix or Amazon) picks it up.",Positive
"Television has become increasingly haunted in the last few years. I guess we all love a good ghost story. This is one of the better shows with good production values and intriguing stories. It provides fun escapist viewing with people who believe what they are saying. Think of it as a documentary of that shadow, that thing under the bed, or why we don't go into the basement after dark.",Positive
"None of it is Amazons fault, just a real bad movie. Had a good story line they could have done so much more.",Negative
each episode was better than expected and went down different paths than expected. Very good writing and acting. Will watch again.,Positive
"As someone who remembers the original Dallas, this reboot is fun, sexy, soapy and just the right amount of shirtless guys.  This is primetime soap at its best.",Positive
"Like many others this show first reminded me of Charmed. It's hard not to make the comparison if you've watched Charmed before.Overall I enjoyed this first season of the show. I feel like the characters, mythos, and stories could perhaps be a little stronger, but I realize that it's still building up and the first season was kind of short. I think this show has a lot of potential if the writers continue and do a good job of building the characters and have good stories. While I don't think we should always compare this show to Charmed, I hope it develops and becomes a solid and fun supernatural show similarly to what we had in Charmed. This next season will likely decide the future of this show and if it'll turn into something great or if it'll struggle to keep ratings up.",Positive
This is a great X story. If anyone knows how the Japanese imagine their heroes and how the approach this genre then you get that flavor here. Great anime and good story. We should have more!!,Positive
"This movie may seem like it has a predictable ending, but it is such a fun trip getting there.  Part of the charm is the adorable Scottish accents and the beautiful Scottish scenery, of course, but it was a treat to see excellent acting by actors other than the usual handful of Academy Award nominees.A beautiful, famous American actress is marrying a Scottish author in Scotland while attempting to avoid droves of paparazzi.  When they discover the photographers are on their trail, a decoy bride (Kelly MacDonald, a local pretty young lady) is hired to throw them off by having a fake wedding.  There is clever dialogue and a fun romp through beautiful scenery.  I recommend it.",Positive
I actually stopped watching this show. I was so tired of them trying to shove the gay part down my thought. It was a pretty funny show in the first and second seasons. A friend told me to give this episode a try. This is probably one of the funnier ones in a LONG time. Still this show has tanked a lot.,Negative
"This show seems fantastic. Has everything you want in a show and was set up to succeed from the very beginning. Not usually my type of show either but not only do I give it 5 stars so do my buddies who love this type of show. It should go all across the board and make a Huge splash in ratings.,",Positive
The writing and acting continue to amaze and delight.  We can't wait for the next episode.  Will probably purchase the series.  Amazon streaming is great.,Positive
"Though these were the last of 10's reign as the Doctor, they were done SO well.  I started watching again with #9 Chris Eccleston.  He was FANTASTIC (hehe) definitely a warrior, but with a soft spot just big enough for Rose Tyler to enter.  After his regeneration into #10 (Tennant) you see the warrior remain, but with more of a loving side.  Tennant's range of emotion, his depiction of a complex character who must travel alone, but longs for companionship - is just hands down incredible.  I don't think there was one episode where I didn't wind up tearing a little by episodes end.  You gotta love a Time Lord with a passionate love for humanity.  Doctor Who #10 is Brilliant!",Positive
"This class of writing is so rare.  The breadth of the story arc, the verisimilitude, the depth of character, and the humor make this an extraordinary series.  We're lucky it was made at all.  Don't regret that there are no more seasons.  It is absolutely perfect as it stands.",Positive
One of the best shows on tv. It hasnt been on for 21 seasons for no reason!  I love the show and reccommend it to anyone.,Positive
"I was so amused and entertained by the this show! I do not watch much TV, but would absolutely watch this if it gets picked up as a series.  These 3 guys are talented funny people!",Positive
Given as a gift! they loved it and are waiting for me to get the nest series in this collection!!!!,Positive
"Whenever another television adaptation of a Stephen King novel comes around, I always feel a little wary. Some of his supernatural offerings seem better suited left to the imagination as opposed to getting a literal screen treatment. That's not to say that there haven't been good interpretations. There have. But there have been just as many failures as successes. If anyone should have a sense of King, it is director Mick Garris who collaborated on previous TV efforts include ""The Stand"" and the much maligned ""The Shining"" miniseries. For me, ""Bag of Bones"" falls squarely in the middle ground of King's television presentations. It has been simplified and changed in ways that purists and/or fans of the novel may not appreciate. But for those unfamiliar with the story, it has its share of pleasures as well. For those expecting big scares, however, the pacing of this two-part miniseries may be a little off-putting. I would describe this as a melancholy murder mystery enhanced by supernatural elements as opposed to any kind of horror show.Not surprisingly, King sticks close to the topics he knows. The protagonist in ""Bag of Bones"" is (once again) a popular writer, played by Pierce Brosnan, who is pushed to the brink of sanity in picturesque Maine. Reeling from a personal tragedy and trying to push through writer's block, Brosnan settles into his family's lakefront country estate. The town is populated by a typical array of eccentrics including a plucky single mother (Melissa George) and an evil town bigwig (TV stalwart William Schallert). It seems that this quaint little berg has seen its share of unpleasantness with a series of murderous drownings through the years. Brosnan starts communing with spirits in the afterlife, and the central mystery seems to have something to do with a blues singer named Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose) of a bygone era. Past and present meet as Brosnan seeks to establish a connection and put a long standing mystery to rest.The leisurely pace allows the viewer to really get to know Brosnan, and he gives a solid lived-in performance. The cast also has Jason Priestly, Matt Frewer, and Annabeth Gish (perhaps the most underrated actress working), but none of them has anything to do before all but disappearing. George is likable enough, but the teleplay doesn't really establish a relationship between her and Brosnan before forcing them together. Schallert is menacing fun and his female companion is a hoot. Noni Rose gets a couple of welcome musical numbers, but isn't developed with much depth. Everything is so straightforward and uncomplicated in this adaptation, it is never very hard to envision where the screenplay is taking you. And when you finally get there, it is so rushed and rather unconvincing.It's fair to say that this adaptation of ""Bag of Bones"" lacks the subtleties and shadings of the novel--but that's probably to be expected. If you aren't anticipating big thrills or an exact replication of the book's plot, I might still recommend this for Brosnan's performance. Without commercials, this clocks in at just over three hours. I, personally, liked this slow build (although someone who watched with me declared it a snooze-fest). I just wished that when we got to the conclusion, it had offered up something of a surprise. Still, it was enjoyable enough. However, it is not a particularly memorable endeavor when you think about all of the King adaptations that have been produced through the years (would they and could they all be made by Frant Darabont for the big screen!). KGHarris, 12/11.",Negative
"And the characters are so well defined and the acting is more than competent. The story is a lot of fun although it becomes a little convoluted in later seasons. Everybody drinks hard alcohol all day, they all carry guns and don't hesitate using them. Character Boyd Crowder is irresistible - bad on steroids. He's just scary. Spectacular acting.",Positive
"The first season of Teen Wolf is exciting and humorous as the characters enter into a world they didn't believe existed. There is danger, love, and a surprise twist that you won't see coming, not to mention a shirtless montage in the special features. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone that loves werewolves or want to get a few laughs mixed in with the danger. Also, this series is not affiliated with the original eighties movie with the same title and follows a completely different story line.",Positive
I love Gus and Shawn I think it would be the coolest to just sit back and watch them work they have added so much laughter to my life and I encourage all my friends and co-workers to watch them just to get a good laugh and watch justice happen!,Positive
"Excellent soundtrack, decidely surprising story lines. The writers and directors need to offer us more reasons to love Klaus. He has lost the tenderness and is devolving into the tragic Macbeth.",Positive
"Feels more like an episode well into the life of a drama than a pilot -much more mature than the other pilots meant for adults. Good casting, actors seemed to be immersed in their characters, excellent writing, good score.",Positive
"When he's sees Little Bill up on the Amazon screen he's always excited to watch it.  I'm not sure why, but it is pretty enjoyable and funny to him.  My four year old daughter doesn't seem to have an opinion, but still likes to watch it with him.",Positive
This season's writers and the regular actors continue to produce exciting and engaging stories and roles to yield another interesting season. It may not be the same caliber as the previous ones but it continues to provide entertaining episodes and peek my interest in the characters development (and love interests).,Positive
"The story is still good, even In to the 3rd season. The characters are well developed and varied. It keeps you interested from start to finish, and still believable.",Positive
"Look I'd give it five stars on the acting alone but the topic and taboo subject matter makes me give it four stars. I really liked the movie, I confess it.. even if I sort of felt kind of icky watching it. Two moms fall in love with each others son...yep icky right. But it was well acted and you want to understand how it could happen and take sides... but all along your like.. no thats just crossing the line.  It was so icky and so crossing the line that I watched it twice :)",Positive
"I first started watching this show via Netflix and didn't think I would like it. But I was greatly surprised. This show is gritty and real.I have actually become a fan and now that I'm caught up, I look forward to watching the current episodes. I highly recommend.",Positive
Who can deny that these shows are so part of this country's history.  How many times do we do a &#34;Lucy&#34; line during the day?,Positive
We live in THE valley and enjoy this humorous and irreverent slice of what happens in the startup world of young geeks.,Positive
I enjoy this show so much that I watched the whole season in 2 days. Now I'm stuck waiting for the next season.,Positive
Longmire has become one of our most favorite shows - the only problem is that we burn through the episodes too fast.  It's like having a freezer full of really good steaks and finishing them in a week because they're so good!,Positive
"But the characters are not well developed and have almost no identification to the book that Mr King wrote so aptly. Very disappointed in this mini-series so far. The only thing I can say is that I will watch it through to the end, since I'm a prime member, and I know there IS an ending.... but I hope if the Great Movie Producer in the sky ever gets the bright idea to do another King novel.... that someone actually reads the book. And has an imagination.",Negative
"I liked this season, but didn't get excited over it like I did season one. It's worth the watch, but maybe wait to see if it comes out on Netflix or Prime first.",Negative
First of all I want to say THANK YOU to amazon.com for carrying Breaking Bad!!!!!  I don't have TV and never will...and I'm busy so I do everything on the computer on my time...and I'm sooooo happy amazon.com has the Final---or season 6 whatever it's called doesn't matter....Just a quick shout out to amazon--Thanks for making it streaming!,Positive
"The Universe is a very good series with a lot of true science. And it is very well explained. Surprised the Creationists diden't picket this one, too!!",Positive
This series is for the young crowd. Lots of episodes are silly to me. But why should I understand the 20 something crowds goings on? I'll keep following the series to see where it goes.,Positive
Have enjoyed this series. Just wish the next season was available under our prime membership. Amazon seems to do this on a regular basis. Gives you the first season but then charges you for the remaining seasons. Too bad Amazon isn't more like Netflex.,Positive
"I really enjoyed this film.  I was on the edge of my seat for most of it.  I thought Alexander Siddiq did a great job as the anguished father searching for his daughter.  I also enjoyed Marisa Tomei,Oded Fehr and Joshua Jackson.  I was very surprised to learn the film was shot in South Africa.  It looked the way I imagined Syria would look.  I highly recommend this film.  Little bad language, no nudity, no sex, some violence.",Positive
I love Justified and this season I thought was even better! Everything moves quickly and the gritty nature of the show continues in season 2. I have binged watched season 1 and 2 with my wife pretty quickly and we can't wait for Season 3,Positive
"At first glance, I was not sure what to make of this show. I did not know that it was made by the same folks as My Name is Earl, or I probably would have turned my attention to it sooner. I find that this series is really funny and light-hearted. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is why we can get behind the kind but morally ambiguous family. The ending of the second season was a little much for me, but the main tie in is Sabrina and Jimmy's fate. This season has so far done an excellent job of keeping the humor from growing stale while maintaining the quirky nature of the characters and their relationships. I am glad I own my seasons, and I recommend them to anyone looking for a good laugh that will also make you go ""hmmm"", but not guilty.Part of you will think, ""I'm glad I'm not THAT family. They're screwed up!"" But a part of you will also say, ""I wish I had their ideals,"" granted not as much as the former. This shows how the relationship of family is stronger than material wealth, but that even those blessed with a lot get that family is more important. The divide isn't as distant as you might think.Great job, Raising Hope cast and crew, writers and director, and all involved! Keep these seasons coming!",Positive
"I was hook even before the cow was clean sliced in half!  Oh, and no the Simpsons episode was not before the book...",Positive
This show may just be the best show ever!!this season it does feel like the gang is running out of show ideas a bit but it is still funny as hell. i have to say i would be totally willing to watch this show way past its prime :-) lol,Positive
This is the most socking and disappointing of the Bones seasons. The short duration because of the writers strike (don&#8217;t they realize the effects of their strike ripple through the years to create animosity?). This caused some short cuts in the plot points of the season. One of the episodes from Season 2 appears in season 3 and it feels horribly out of place. The finally was very well done and leaves you on the edge of your seat!,Negative
"A quirky comedy with excellent performances by all the main cast members. Lou Taylor Pucci is especially good as a new comer to acting. You should definitely check out some of his other performances. I can highly recommend &#34;The Story of Luke&#34;. Also Lou Taylor Pucci in &#34;The Music Never Stops&#34;. He is a brilliant performer, and I see a great future ahead of him.",Positive
"I love the interaction of all the ensemble characters and the beautiful stars.  I love the writing, the weirdness and the uncompromising scientific lingo.  I love the comedic relief and all the plot lines.  I love the story line and how it's unfolded.  I am hooked.",Positive
"WOW the school system should try to be teaching this, I would be willing to bet that 95% would not know who these men are. .While I knew of each man I did not know how they interrelated, We need some folks like this now. These biographies can give you an insight on economics and how one action affects another. These men all looked beyond what is in front of them. Something..that is sadly lacking today. . A great series.  .",Positive
We like this show.  It is good and funny sometimes and serious and dramatic all at once.  Lots of killing but not terribly gruesome.,Positive
This award-winning festival hit stars Emile Hirsch (&#34;Into the Wild&#34;) and Stephen Dorff (&#34;Somewhere&#34;) as two brothers who are forced to flee Reno after being involved in a hit-and-run accident. Based on the novel by Willy Vlautin.,Negative
"Concise, short and to the point. Well focused on topic. These informative segments with nice graphics tell the story of our universe. I enjoyed how they focused on single topics. There is some overlap between a few segments but over all I watched them, got hooked and could not put these down. Very surprising videos. This left me wanting more!  Did I mention that the music is really nice. Great mix of ambient and electronic. To my taste anyway!",Positive
"I did not know about plural marriage only Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Even in some cultures there do observe and practice plural marriage even women having multiple husbands (Kody). I grew to love this family even though I personally do not care for plural marriage for my self but I respect them. Why? yes it will be jealousy there but they work on that problem as well as others together work through it be honest about it and work on it and work together as a team to make things work. The Browns have shown me what can happen when two people really have God in their hearts work together and stay together to make their marriage work. Most people cant even work on their marriage with just two people!  I love the Browns .",Positive
Tim Allen does it again.  He has surrounded himself with a good cast and this show works.  Very funny and entertaining.  We stumbled across this by accident and we keep coming back for more.  The bad thing is this is a half hour program but Amazon charges the same as for an hour program.  This is a it frustrating.  We highly recommend this show.,Positive
"Good characters but slim on story. I like the angelic presence, but wish the show was just a bit more broad in it's spiritual references.",Positive
"Very very little &#34;action.&#34; This riveting drama is driven by plot and characterization mainly, which is refreshing. The desaturated colors match the downbeat pace and rainy Pacific Northwest locale perfectly. You'll love it or hate it. I love it.",Positive
"This sounded good but it was bad. The gratuitous sex was unnecessary, and the overacting wasn't pleasant. The story didn't seem plausible either.",Negative
"Funny. Incisive. Great entertainment. A barrel of laughs (I'm rolling on the floor now).  Watch it, if you dare. Haaaa, haaaaa!",Positive
"By far, the best finale ever. I love how they tied in all the other episodes from the whole series into the ending. I don't think I've ever been so pleased by the end of a tv series and I love how this series never got &#34;old.&#34;Great cast and characters, great storyline. I highly recommend this whole series.",Positive
I've always like Benedict Cumberbatch. I first watched him in Masterpiece Theater's Sherlock which he does masterfully. I haven't watched all of this series but the first episodes were very exciting.,Positive
"This show rocks! You simply  can't go wrong with Timothy Olephant, so consider yourself warned, this series is extremely addictive!",Positive
"I loved this steampunk movie A LOT (a lot better in the theatrical version!). Usually the DIRECTOR'S CUT imprint means a longer or more violent version. Not so here. The director chose to REMOVE (CUT) 10 minutes of the theatrical version - story and rather important scenes (nothing that will make the movie incomprehensible though). On this blu-ray I EXPECTED the choice between the theatrical version and the ""Director's Cut"", but no, we only get the Director's cut, so I took 1 star OFF the rating.I LOVED this movie in its theatrical form. It is still great in this form, but if you've seen the longer version you will definitely MISS some scenes!On blu-ray, why not give us the CHOICE between both versions - or sell them BOTH seprately at least? The theatrical version is NOT available at all in the US to my knowledge.Besides this issue, I really liked MUTANT CHRONICLES a lot. It is very dark and the story is very interesting with some new ideas. Great actors (including Ron Pearlman, Tom Jane, Devon Aoki, Benno Fuhrmann and a cameo by John Malkovich and, last but not leat, a great performance by Sean Pertwee).",Positive
"Blue's Clues is both educational and entertaining. Kids enjoy it,  it doesn't get annoying, and it's not crude humor.",Positive
This is one of the best written and acted comedies on television.  I belly laugh at this show. Seriously - this is some funny stuff.,Positive
I have always loved sci-fi stuff but real science intimidated me a LOT. I went back to college in my 40s and found out not only did I like science I was pretty good at it. This led to an interest in shows and books I wouldn't have touched earlier. This show takes the people on the cutting edge of science and tops in their field and presents their ideas in laymen terms as much as possible. Since I am definitely a layman I appreciate this very much. I am looking forward to season 3 :-)!,Positive
I always enjoy Poirot.  He never fails to discover who the culprit is in his episodes.  The fashion of that time is interesting. I love his character in the stories.,Positive
"The show is better than the News Room which I like very much, with or without all the criticisms I have read and as intriguing, if not more so than Mad Men.  Have really come to like the characters, especially Ben Wishaw.  Also, the actress playing Dominic West's wife has grown on me to the point that I do care about what happens to her.  Overall, a great show.  Oh, yeah, can't forget Roma Garai and Anna Chancellor, the two of whom I am a big fan.",Positive
Cute litlesseries. Kid friendly BUT with a bit of an adult theme and implied sexual content. Nothing kids don't see on TV on a daily basis.,Positive
"My favorite line in this whole opening episode was &#34;I'm thinking about it right now.&#34;--when they're all in the kitchen--made me guffaw!  Cheesy parts: practicing lines far too long in the mirror, elevator scene in fast panic mode, confusing street crowd, swim scene,  running around in the woods scene. But overall, I like something different--rather seemed like a mix of The Stand/Walking Dead/Falling Skies rolled into one.",Negative
The Walking Dead team has accomplished something quite difficult.  They've taken a season to deeply develop characters without sacrificing the action and suspense the show is known for.  Kudos!,Positive
"Funny, fresh, nuanced and deeply humanistic..  Both are excellent actors with a wide range and cute to boot!  2 more words: watch them!",Positive
"I think we can all agree that a good horror movie is hard to make. At best, 90% of the horror films out there can be classified as ""so bad it's funny."" I think we can also agree that good comedies are hard to come by, too. For every40-Year-Old Virgin, there are a millionLittle MansorGiglis. (This is me assuming that Gigli was meant as a comedy.) The point being that, as ubiquitous as these genres are in the market, it's hard to find it ever done right, let alone done right TOGETHER. Horror-Comedy. It's a helluva beast to try to tame. Of course, you're gonna end up with more comedy than horror, but it also means you're gonna have a lot more blood, guts, and general mayhem then you'd get in a comedy, even compared to Gigli. Written by comedy vets Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant, HELL BABY certainly isn't shy about its guts (or most other body parts), but it also stays firmly encamped in the area of the goofy, disembowelings notwithstanding.If you are a fan of any halfway decent comedy of the past decade, you'll see more than a few familiar faces. For the most part, these people play characters that seem like incarnations of every other role they've had, but that's no insult. They're funny folks -- Rob Corddry, Paul Scheer, Rob Huebel, Keegan Michael Key, Kumail Nanjiani, Michael Ian Black, Leslie Bibb  -- and it's fun to watch them obviously having fun playing these funny roles. Of course, Lennon and Garant bring to bear their incredible ability to slide chameleon-like into their roles, and they steal the show as a pair of chain-smoking, hard-edged Catholic priests.It's a lot of fun, the film, although it does seem to pull more than few comedic punches. For a flick of this variety, you'd expect them to layer it on thick and fast, but the movie has a casual, episodic feel. And for every two or three weird, wild, and offbeat gags, there's at least one that you're bound to predict. You'd expect maybe a few more surprises from Lennon and Garant.Maybe the film feels so easy-going with its jokes because it takes so long for the titular infant to actually make his appearance, at which point the film goes full-tilt into cartoon-style violence and absurdity. If they'd found a quicker way to bring the ridiculously evil baby into the script, it might've juiced the film up a bit. (I'm no scriptwriter, though; the baby is really, really goofy-looking. Maybe too much of that would've crossed over from funny into just plain campy.) As it is, it's still an amusing, chaotic (and violent) mess, but it feels like the film finally finds its own in a way that's a little too late and over too fast.Expect mostly jokes and some pretty gruesome deaths, but don't worry too much about being frightened. (In fact, the scariest thing in the film is Riki Lindhome's shower scene. I mean, I think she's a beautiful woman, but this movie marks the first time I've ever seen her fully nude (brave work, Ms. Lindhome, spending what felt like five minutes going full frontal), and she's so skinny it's unsettling. I kept thinking, ""Someone get that po' girl a po' boy."") At any rate, if you're a fan of even just one of the names I've already mentioned, you should see this film. You may not split as many sides or bust as many guts as the devil in the film, but you'll still have a good time.",Positive
"Yet another idiotic time waster. Bunch of inept, sensitive, and earnest bakers, baking crappy cupcakes for glory. Gimme a break!",Negative
"This is a well made film, with first rate actors, Ryan Gosling, Kirsten Dunst and Frank Langella.  It's based on a true story which adds interest to the film.  All the actors do a good job.  Ryan Gosling makes a very sick fellow seem almost sympathetic, at least for a while.  Dunst is a sunny delight to watch.After seeing the film I read a bit about the actual event that prompted the story and that filled in some of the missing piece about Deborah, the friend of the husband.  Apparently in ""real life"" she married the fellow.It's a good film but not one that I'd recommend as great entertainment.  I'm giving it three and a half stars.",Negative
"Very funny, action and weirdness that is great. Each character is just crazy enough to befunny enough. The plots are different but believable.",Positive
"Carter was the best part of the show softening the mens' lack of personalities.  It's a good show, but I am disappointed.",Negative
"Being a huge fan of Craig Johnson's series about Walt Longmire, I am so happy to be able to add the TV series to my video library.  Here's to a long, long run!  Will be telling my friends about this program.Maggie",Positive
"Let me state upfront that I, like most people, have heard of Linda Lovelace, but I knew next to nothing about her, other than she starred in ""Deep Throat"" (which I haven't seen) over 40 years ago. But this movie made quite a splash when it was first screened earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, and I couldn't wait to see it. Now the movie is finally out, both in theatres and on VOD.""Lovelace"" (2013 release; 93 min.) starts in 1970 when we get to meet Linda (played by Amanda Seyfried), living at home with her ultra-strict parents (played by Robert Patrick and Sharon Stone). Linda gets to know Chuck (played by Peter Sarsgaard) and they hit it off. It's not long before Linda moves in with him (and eventually marries him), but it's equally not long before Chuck, in desperate need of money, is getting Linda involved in shady things, leading to what eventually would become ""Deep Throat"" (for which she was paid $1,250). But the problems with Chuck run much deeper than that. At some point Linda flees back to her parents' house, hoping to stay just a few days, when mom coldly turns her away with ""you married Chuck, you must obey him"". To tell you more would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is a performers' dream as there are so many choice roles, and most of them relish the challenge and run with it. Let's start with Amanda Seyfried as the title character: her days on ""As The World Turns"" and ""All My Children"", and even ""Mean Girls"" are long gone! Seyfried really surprised me with this role. And then there is Peter Sarsgaard, who must have salivated at the opportunity to play the challenging role of Chuck, as unlikeable character as you'll ever meet. Sarsgaard does it brilliantly. But top honors must go (in my book anyway) to Sharon Stone as Linda's mother. If I hadn't known beforehand that Stone was in this role, I would've never recognized her. This may be the very best performance of her career, period. There are tons of other notable performers in this movie (James Franco gets about 5 min. of screen time as Hugh Hefner; Hank Azaria; Chris Noth; and Chlo Sevigny in a blink it and you'll miss it appearance, just to name those). I often think that movies run too long, but in this case it is the opposite, as it feels in particular the latter years are skimped over too quickly. Last but not least, there is a delight soundtrack, mostly early 70s FM staples but also some lesser known nuggets, and it complements the film perfectly. One final note: there is some nudity in the movie but given the subject matter, there could've been lots more.""Lovelace"" showed up at my local art-house theatre this past weekend here in Cincinnati. I saw it at a recent matinee, and I had a private showing, as in: I was literally the only one in the theatre. It makes me think that this will not play long, which is unfortunate, as this is a good, if at times difficult, movie, with brilliant performances. If you are in the mood for a quality indie movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, ""Lovelace"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",Positive
"Love this show.  Sherlock and Holmes disfuntional relationship is always entertaining, and Sherlocks deductive skills stay true to the original premise of Sherlock Holmes.  Great supporting cast as well.",Positive
"There's not much on TV I enjoy and I HATE commercials. I love that I can watch Revenge when I'm ready, commercial free. AND, I love Amazon.com for providing it.",Positive
Great season ending.  Lots of action throughout the episodes and really moved faster along the plot than season 1.  Good character acting by all.,Positive
"Gossip Girl has grown up and with those crucial scandalous high school years behind her, cannot make the translation into adulthood (or what approximates it on this show.)  Salacious has turned to sleaze and the bad girls aren't really clever, just mean.  All of the conniving has worn thin and while earlier seasons seemed like underhanded moral plays in pretty cloths, this episode reeks of ugly.",Negative
"Its a weird name for a kid and kids show.  I don't particularly care for this show, because the characters voice is whiny and annoying, but my kids like it so I suffer through it for them.  Over all its a good kids show, I just don't care for it because, well...I am an adult.",Negative
"I didn't start watching Breaking Bad until four seasons and half of the fifth season were already on Netflix. I checked out the first episode and was hooked. I watched almost all the episodes, thru to the finale, within a two week period. That's right, I had my own little five-season Breaking Bad Marathon. The show is that good!! There are lots of sad scenes, a lot of violence, some really emotional moments that will have you looking for the box of tissues, but also some really funny moments. You can't help but root for the main characters, and hope everything works out for them, all the while on edge waiting to see what the show will throw at you next. There are so many twists and turns and outstanding  surprises in every episode. What a fantastic series!",Positive
"No blood in this Viking doc, but it does list some interesting facts about the viking voyages, challenges some established theories about the Vikings and brings new theories to light.",Positive
"Best new show of the season, one of the strongest pilots ive seen in quite some time, hope it stays great as season continues.",Positive
I am a God fearing woman and sex scenes are not what I want to watch so I changed the show immediately.,Negative
If you read my reviews on the first three seasons you know this is one great show.  The characters continue to grow and the show continues to fill the serious dramma and Mary's sceptical point of view is always there to lighten the mood.  Season four has some new twists and turns from the first three seasons that is the perfect set up for season five.,Positive
"This is a true eye opener to the rules for downstairs. Loved it and it's a must watch. Found some of the issues amusing but could never been a downstairs staff. Terrible life and especially the hall boy with the chamber pots duty. Then they had two scullery maids quit after a day.Realize they had no soap for washing dishes, couldn't take baths and had to turn away or not be seen when the masters passed them upstairs.Loved the chef and the meals he made. How he did it it is beyond belief. Did nit like that the upstairs did nit at least thank the staff for the entertainment meal when the chef was ill. They were a bit snooty.This is a must watch series.",Positive
"In the early `70's, the tawdry adult film industry discovered a new star.  Linda Lovelace (Amanda Seyfried) whose real name was Boreman had what was at the time, an unusual gift for fellatio.  This film attempts to provide some context as to how she became an icon of the porn industry.  To some degree the story comes from her own biography, ""Ordeal.""Linda was a somewhat nave teenager growing up in a strict religious family.  Her mother, Dorothy (an unrecognizable and excellent Sharon Stone) was particularly tough on Linda.  Perhaps that was due to the fact that Linda already had a baby which was put up for adoption.  While the film mentions the child, it is quickly glossed over.  Linda meets an older man who owns a cheapo disco club.  Chuck Traynor (played with remarkable sleaze by Peter Sarsgaard) has eyes for Linda and slowly builds up their relationship to the point that she trusts him with everything.  Next thing you know, they're married.Chuck has a number of low life connections including those involved in the porn industry.  At that time, much of it was controlled by the mob.  He convinces Linda that auditioning for an adult film would lead to legitimate acting gigs.  After a few head bobbing lessons from Chuck, he films her abilities and shows the film to a director (Hank Azaria) and producer/mobster (Chris Noth).  She's in.  They make the film ""Deep Throat.""  By the standards of the time, the film was top shelf stuff.  With a decent budget, a modestly interesting script, some humor and of course Linda's deep throat, the film begins to draw in mainstream audiences.Chuck, by now is squandering money he doesn't have.  He's coked up most of the time and even rents out Linda to a handful of business men for their enjoyment.  This is disgusting stuff to be sure.  The film presents Linda as just a victim in all of this.  And certainly, based on her mother's warnings (""Just do what your husband wants you to do."") and Chuck's temper, is honest in some degree.  But Linda says that this is the only film she made and she only was in ""the business"" for 17 months.  I'm not sure that's true and I know there was more than one film she appeared in.The film can be shocking at times, but most of the explicit scenes aren't.  There are plenty of bare breasts but otherwise not much beyond suggestion.  The acting is very good, but the film left me cold.The Blu ray version comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The film has a bit of softness to it which certainly isn't offensive and actually seems appropriate for the era.  There is also a fair amount of grain in the picture but again, no big deal.  The disc comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  The surround feature comes in primarily during the several party scenes and nights at the clubs.  Otherwise, this is a mostly dialog driven movie and comes in clear and concise.  There is only one extra called ""Behind Lovelace"" which is a 13 minute piece consisting of the cast and crew commenting on Linda.  Yawn...",Negative
"BEST NEW SHOW THIS SEASON! I love the characters, I love the idea, I love plane! ha.  It's still very early into the 'growing' of the characters and their relationships, but it working for me! Watch it, I think you'll like it!",Positive
"Essentially a romance, as Raymond Chandler would put it: that is a fantasy rather than an attempt to capture the reality of a life situation. His Marlowe, he said, and the situations in which he participated were an attempt at fictional creation not the way life really is. This is a good and entertaining show, at least in this first season, in which never to be found in real life characters, provide an unreal world of drama and comedy, of people who pique our interest through  the unreal things they do, which to us, for the brief time in which they are  on-tv-stage, may seem very real. The star would be very obnoxious (in the part she plays, that is) if one had to deal with her in real life; in a fiction she is made to seem quite human and appealing--with foibles. At this stage of development in the show (I've seen nothing of the other seasons) the star is carrying the show surrounded by some well-played and potentially interesting supporting players.I liked it with qualifications based on my more than occasional irritation with the Star. I think that people who like a show that does not seek to tell it as it is, will be appealing to many in the audience. It is certainly worth a try.",Positive
"Spanish director Mateo Gil delivers a tale based on the long time rumor that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid escaped the shootout with the Bolivian army in 1908.  Butch (a terrific Sam Shepard), 15 years later is living in a small village in the South American country using the name James Blackthorn.  He raises horses and now has enough money to return to the United States and seek out the child that was borne by Etta Place (Dominique McElligott). Etta had recently died in San Francisco.  As most people familiar with the legend and/or the Redford/Newman film, Etta was a partner of Butch and Sundance (Padraic Delaney) and in more ways than one.  We are left to believe there is some question as to the parentage of Etta's offspring.There are several scenes of reflection when Butch thinks of their earlier arrival in South America.  In those scenes he is played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.  It is during one of these flashbacks that we learn the fate of Sundance.Several miles into his journey Butch has an unfortunate encounter with a Spaniard who is on the run from a dozen men.  Butch loses his horse and his money, so reluctantly agrees to accompany and help Eduardo (Eduardo Noriega) with the promise of securing $25,000. That is half of what Eduardo had stolen from a silver mining company.  Their journey is the movie and it is not without incident and complications.  The last of which seemed unnecessary to me.In any case the Bolivian production crew does an excellent job shooting the film.  The photography is as good as anything I've seen.  This is a very good extension of the Butch and Sundance legend and certainly worth a look.  The HD disc shows the gorgeous green Bolivian vistas in great detail.  The sound is mostly upfront.  There are no huge gun battles here so that should be expected.",Positive
A tense and exciting show. We enjoyed it very much. Gives a lot of thought into what a government can and would do for its own benefit!,Positive
"GREAT ACTING...GREAT WRITING...GREAT CHARACTERS...I CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF JUSTIFIED...I'M HOOKED. RAYLAN IS THE COOLEST CHARACTER ON TV...OH, AND I HATE THE MINIMUM WORD REQUIREMENT ON THESE POSTS WHICH IS WHY I IGNORE THEM MOST OF THE TIME.",Positive
"I watch this with my almost 16 year old daughter.  Very funny, a bit risqu&eacute; but well written with many squirmy moments.",Positive
The series flows coherently. Characters are appealing.Hope to have it continue on prime soon.Thanks for showing us this season.,Positive
Hannibal himself is played in a very studied emotional way with a believable sense of menace just below the surface. The plot line is just a bit loose and although the series has a great deal of talent the script does not take full advantage. I think this will be eventually corrected in season 2.,Positive
After you have watched a few series there is no more mystery. Its just something to pass time when I have nothing to do.,Negative
This is the kind of show that my husband would enjoy.  It has good plot and detail.  I liked it.,Positive
"Far from going downhill, I think HOUSE made some difficult choices in its melange of characters and those choices were correct to make.  First and foremost, Cameron and Chase were weak characters played by weak actors.  They have been all but completely pushed off the show and they should be.  They have been replaced by much stronger actors, especially the incredibly strong actors Peter Jacobson and Kal Penn as supporting doctors. The already strong characters (played by strong actors) of Foreman, Cuddy and Wilson remain, with bolder roles than ever.  Of course, they are all dominated and eclipsed by Hugh Laurie as HOUSE himself.  For anyone who has been living in a cave without a tv for the last 5 years, HOUSE is a series tv show about one of the top internists in the world who correctly diagnoses just about every freak medical condition which exists.  He is played by British actor Hugh Laurie who is incredibly convincing as an American.  I watched Hugh Laurie on British tv in his earlier shows, especially with Stephen Fry, and HOUSE is as opposite a role from those as one could imagine. HOUSE functions like the modern day incarnation of Arthur Conan Doyle's twin inspirations, his medical mentor and professor, Dr. Joseph Bell, also a premier diagnostician, plus his literary creation, detective Sherlock Holmes. HOUSE has all the same off putting social characteristics as Holmes plus he is likewise musical and a drug addict (pain killers).  Wilson, the oncologist in the same hospital, is as close to a Watson as HOUSE can find.  He is the only one who long term puts up with HOUSE as a friend.  There are lots of surprises in this season which I cannot mention because they would be terrible spoilers.  I will say the ending this time is the very best one the show has ever done and is totally fitting for the way the character HOUSE has been developed.  I am waiting eagerly for season 6.",Positive
"It was getting iffy there for a while. I had actually quit watching it after the 6th season. I caught some 7th/8th season episodes here and there, enough to know what was going on in the 9th but the 9th definitely pulled me back in. If you're an Arizona fan, you'll get plenty of her. I also love the April and Jackson storyline. Meredith and Derek have new things going on. Cristina is still hilarious. I say give this season a shot.",Positive
"This show is completely different, a dog who doesn't exist , and yet he's very real in one mans world. There are sexual comments, and pot smoking, but still a very funny show.",Positive
"This show didn't make me laugh out loud a single time. But: it was amusing, and I really liked the premise (two generally decent guys who work office jobs for an evil galactic empire). The writing was pretty solid, but there were points where attempts to be funny ended up being off-putting. The show wasn't as charming as it thought it was, but it was still pretty decent. I like the main character (or at least the guy I think is the main character) and his motivations, and I think they could tell a compelling story for a while. It's worth watching through, because you will likely find it at least somewhat enjoyable (most people seem to be reviewing it alright).It's something where--if there was a season or two out there--I'd watch it over the course of a week or so, enjoy it, and never really think of it again. That's not a bad thing. Long story short: it's got potential to be a fun show, but not necessarily one I'd rave about. I'd definitely watch more of it.",Negative
It was gripping with actors presenting each character to their fullest. Just could not wait to see what happens next through each segment. Did not know that Charles Dickens could write such a vivid book explaining of each one actor(s) trials.,Positive
"I really wish they'd all stop talking in the same way, like everything's an emergency and they memorized all they're going to say (which they did, of course). Sometimes it gets better, sometimes slides back, but worth watching to decide for yourself.",Positive
"this episode is wonderful! if you love the walking dead, you know all about this episode. It's suspenseful and heart wrenching. Totally worth watching over and over and over again",Positive
"It's cheesy, overly dramatic and involves teenage angst and wiggly eyebrows, but you have to live this series. It has the familiar plot progressions that have been seen in the previous instalments and plenty of actions tis nice to have a lighter vampire series than true blood and this one continues to deliver",Positive
I didn't watch this when it was actually airing but am enjoying the program now.  To me it is one of best TV programs about the lives of city officers I have seen.,Positive
"The acting is not bad.  The story seems to have a lot of potential.  Still, nothing that interesting happens.  Often it is slow, not scary.  The characters are not interesting.  It starts with a sex scene for shock value or simply to entice you to watch.  That is your first sign that the show has little substance.But, worse than all flaws possible, the wolf form is corny and fake!  First of all, it is a wolf form like the ones in Twilight (Oh! I Just vomited).  Effects bring it to life; however they are very fake, cheesy, and distracting.  Furthermore, the werewolf should be humanoid.  Like the ones in the Howling, Underworld, Van Helsing, Wolf Man movies (to name a few).  Nobody wants to follow a glorified dog around for an hour.There is not enough story here to stick around.  If you want to enjoy a werewolf story, try the movies mentioned above or readThe Mammoth Book of Wolf Men,THE ULTIMATE WEREWOLF,Werewolves and Shape Shifters: Encounters with the Beasts Within,The Wolf Gift: The Wolf Gift Chronicles (1).Also, you might likeGinger Snaps,Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed,Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning,An American Werewolf in Paris,An American Werewolf in London,Stephen King's Silver Bullet [HD],  and Cursed with Christina Ricci.",Negative
"Vincent is a police officer, but is also involved with drug deals and the mob. His involvement with the mob gets more-and-more dangerous as he makes deliveries, pick-ups, and promises. After he gets into deep trouble from problems with the mob, his son is kidnapped. The clock ticks fast as time is not on his side, and his situation could be tragedy for him and his son. Action-Packed, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and thrilling from start to finish. Highly Recommended!",Positive
This is another one that the grand kids fight over who is going to see what.  Youngest wants to watch all of the season before I turn it off.,Positive
"Incredibly brave effort from this film maker and the people who questioned the official explanation of the destruction of TWA flight 800.The story is told without hyperbole, listing the steps of such an investigation as it should and would normally have been completed. The film then explains how those steps were corrupted and/or omitted, so as to reach what appears to be an erroneous conclusion.Who benefitted from the apparently false, official explanation for this tragedy?If you believe that Oswald acted alone you probably won't appreciate this film. If you are open to the possibility that governments are not always honest with citizens, this is a thoroughly absorbing movie that raises important questions which remain unanswered.",Positive
"Clever writing, interesting concept, the humor is sharp and just dark enough. and Malcom McDowell is always interesting to watch. I hope Amazon produces this series.",Positive
This is a beautiful video show.  I love nature.  I enjoy watching this series because these landscapes and animal are on the verge of extinction.  This is a good documentary.,Positive
"My husband, 23 year old son, and I watched this series for about 10 days&#8230; each night catching up to this season's showings.  Fun for three of us.  It's light-hearted, not too dark or brooding.  We all enjoy it.",Positive
If there was ever a sequel to catcher in the rye... this would be it. The humor is witty and sharp plot twists abound and there are many belly laughs thrown in. Binge watch it!,Positive
Just keeps getting better.  Only one more season left and the gap it will leave will only be filled by watching it all over again...,Positive
"When I was teaching physical science to middle school, and high school kids, I did many of the &#34;Busters&#34; demonstrations and experiments on a smaller scale that they do on a much larger scale.  Give a 12 to 18 year old boy fire, something that burns or explodes, changes color, or does other &#34;neat&#34; things, and they are as happy as a hog in a wallow. I have a background in the sciences, i.e. a B.S. and M.Ed in the sciences (biology, earth, chemistry, and the physical sciences), and science education and I appreciate their approach in generating an interest in science. I wish they were around when I was at the 12-18 year old age range.  I did have Mr. Wizard, and I think he influenced me to go on as I did.",Positive
"I love the new British version,Sherlock, but there is indeed something quite special about having Watson played by a female lead. Lucy Lu does an amazing job as her character and the two combined bring quite an emotional connection to the characters and stories portrayed. Not to mention the comedy that often plays off of Sherlock's quirkiness.",Positive
Slowly but surely the soap opera infiltrated the show and less and less mystery. I hope season 4 is not all washed up.,Negative
Great picture. A must see.,Positive
This is a very smart adultoon ( adult cartoon).  Love the innuendo both subtle and blatant.  Worth checking it out,Positive
"I had high hopes for this movie based on some of the other reviews and the fact that I like Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. Unfortunately, there were few redeeming qualities about this movie and their acting wasn't among them.The storyline fell flat, the acting was shallow, and Richard Gere's character was a total A-hole. Didn't care what happened to him at all. And it turns out that his wife, played by Susan Sarandon, was just as bad. She really didn't care what he did or how he did it as long as he didn't bring his problems ""to their doorstep"" or get their daughter in trouble (the daughter was the firm's CFO).The entire film felt like a made for TV movie, not a national theater release. Actually, it felt like a Lifetime channel made for TV movie!The only redeeming character was the young man who begrudgingly helped Gere's character. He was the only one who had a heart and deserved leniency. He and maybe Gere's daughter.The kicker for me though, was that the movie was so poorly done that they put Susan Sarandon in a cheap prom-like gown to go to a charity ball. Now, keep in mind that Sarandon and Gere's characters are multi-millionaires in their mid-50s. So why in the world would she be in an ill-fitting ugly cheap dress that looked like a 1980s prom gown?Why do I care about the dress? Because it just highlighted the fact that the writers and directors did not pay attention to small details that would have made this film more believable and more worth watching. As it is, Arbitrage was a thrill-less drama with a stupid ending that should have left me wondering what would happen to Gere's character. Instead, I was left wondering why in the world I wasted my time and money on this ridiculous movie.",Negative
"This is one of those shows that should be watched by the entire family, as we use to do 35 years ago... and discuss the brilliance and history that intertwines in this mostly fictional drama about another time in our history, our lives, our America.",Positive
It was just beginning to be than just a romantic show. Some action was just beginning!  Hope it makes it through another season!,Positive
Its a great show but its a shame it didn't go on I think this was one of the shows that went bust with the strike a few years ago.,Positive
"I never understood why people hated this show. I am not sorry that I loved it. It was abrasive and raw, but then again, so is life. Whitney was funny, but my favorite interactions were Mark and Roxanne, you just knew they were going to get together. Alex was what every supportive boyfriend should be, and in season on Neal and Lily were hilarious.",Positive
"It is difficult to find movies or series which my husband will enjoy and which also have closed-captions for me (very hard of hearing). This was satisfactory on both counts.....however, the closed captions were &#34;very small&#34; so I had to bring a chair up to the 55&#34; flat screen and watch at a much closer distance than I would have preferred. We have discovered that productions from Britain are more to our liking than most American made productions.",Positive
Can't get enough of this show! Just enough drama with some slices of comedy thrown in...makes for the perfect thing to watch to unwind after a day at the office.,Positive
fell downhill quite a bit as a show. Went from my favorite to just 'meh',Negative
Awesome awesome show,Positive
This series continues to be driven by strong characters and their interesting interactions. Nothing is as it seems and no one is truly safe or clean.,Positive
"Wow, what can I say this is one of the best written show on the tube, the cast is great and the chemistry between the major players are awesome! Looking forward for more exciting plots! 2 thumbs up!!",Positive
"I was snowed in one afternoon and rather than do anything productive I elected to watch this film.  To my surprise it held my attention and I confess that I rather enjoyed it.  The story is interesting -- how lives connect and there are lots of great locations: Paris, Vienna, London, the Denver airport in a snowstorm. Many languages are spoken and a certain amount of skin is shown.  People fall in love and leave and switch partners, quit jobs and get fired.  An Imman and a psychiatrist are consulted as well as a call girl.  There's a Russian gangster too --something for almost everyone.  If I sound condescending I have to admit that I sat through the Whole Thing and if I were really honest I'd probably give it four stars.  But I won't because I don't really want to give shoppers the idea that this is a better film than it is.The cast is great, though and there are a few genuinely moving moments in the segment with Anthony Hopkins as a man searching for his missing daughter.  Jude Law is always exquisite and the rest of the cast is very good.  If you don't expect high art or you're snowed in you might enjoy this film.",Negative
"See my review on season 1, it only disappoints more in the end.  Watch and you'll see, not terrible but just lazy.",Negative
"This is one of the best science fiction mini-series ever, and it is far better than the 80s original.  What if advanced aliens openly arrived on Earth, professing friendship but with ulterior motives?  This series examines this premise plausibly and with zip.  The pilot grips the viewer immediately, and by the end of it I was hooked.  Elizabeth Mitchell as Erica Evans is, as always for Mitchell, superb. Morena Baccarin, as ""Anna"" the leader of the Visitors, manages a wonderful combination of beauty and creepiness.  Linda Vandervoort as ""Lisa,"" another Visitor well, she is just plain beautiful.  The special effects here are several cuts above what one expects to find on television.  This pilot hooked me on the series and for good reason.  Great entertainment.  RJB.",Positive
"The over-saturation of Marvel superhero movies on Hollywood and movie theaters across the world continues with the second Captain America movie, &#8220;The Winter Soldier&#8221;. There is an over-saturation that many will take issue with me saying and many will agree, but in order to remain diplomatic I will admit that over-saturation can be forgiven when the script is good. I don't mind superhero movies, in fact, I love them; but I have had issues with the vanilla screenplays that have been present more often than not.The original &#8220;Captain America&#8221; film, in my opinion, was one of those vanilla screenplays with a ultra weak villain and large chunks of film taken up with multiple montage sequences due to lazy storytelling and doing what many of the superhero movies are guilty of, setting up future films. They are all guilty of setting up future films, but some it seems it was their only purpose. &#8220;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#8221; sets up future films as well, but I'm happy to say that I didn't see a single montage in the entire film and the script is one of the better of all of the Marvel movies.There are some flashback scenes in &#8220;Winter Soldier&#8221; that remind us of events in the original film. The original was 3-years ago and so the reminders are welcome, but more importantly they serve importance because the films are connected. It is recommended that you watch the first film before seeing the new one, despite the fact that I found it disappointing for the most part. Thankfully, &#8220;Winter Soldier&#8221; makes viewing the first one worth while.Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have maybe learned a lesson after writing the first &#8220;Captain America&#8221; because they also wrote &#8220;Thor: The Dark World&#8221;. Both &#8220;Dark World&#8221; and &#8220;Winter Soldier&#8221; are in my humble opinion, huge improvements upon the typical screenplay's we are getting with these movies. Finally, we are getting stories with some substance and movies that are not just superhero movies but great action movies and great science fiction movies.&#8220;Winter Soldier&#8221; is a grand technological achievement because the best thing about it is that the creators have achieved a world where you feel as if the marvel world could exist. The action sequences are real and intense and the 'superness' of Captain America is nicely blended into the real world environments. The best part of &#8220;Winter Soldier&#8221; though, is that we actually get a feel of who Captain America is. Not just his powers, but who he is as a man and what makes him tick. That is the type thing that makes a good movie and a good screenplay, great.Whether you like superhero movies are not, &#8220;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#8221; is not just that; it is a great action movie. It quite simply revitalizes my hope that the rest of Marvel's flood of movies won't be disappointing, just as I was about to lose interest. Marvel is finally putting all that money we've given them toward a better product and in wiser places; screenplays.",Positive
"OF COURSE THE STAR HOLDS THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER; HOWEVER, HE HAS AN EXCELLENT CAST TO WORK WITH.  THE STORY LINES ARE ALWAYS RIGHT TO THE POINT AND DON'T LINGER.  A MUST WATCH SERIES. TO BAD IT IS OVER.",Positive
"So, I'm not even really sure what to say about this.  It's.... well, it's definitely high definition.  The random crap they put on the screen is certainly very, very clearly random crap.  What I don't understand is why anyone would want such a complicated screen saver because fundamentally speaking, that's what it is.On the slightly more serious side, I can see why this might be relaxing.  It's just pure random nothing and if you stare at it long enough it does start to mesmerize you.  The CGI is about 1990s quality and the music is a sort of vague, slow electronica that's also from the 90s.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews. If you find my review helpful please vote appropriately. If you do not, then please leave me a comment indicating what you want to know and I'll be sure to do better next time.",Positive
"Hollywood is full of adaptations, sequels, prequels, remakes, re-imaginings, reboots, and spin-offs. The bottom line is that most movies hitting the big screen are familiar territory. When something original does come along, it usually ""borrows"" elements from films that influenced it or pays homage to said influential films that came before it. Truth be told, at this stage in the game, technically everything has already been done. Everything has already been written about or filmed or drawn or created digitally. All that's really left out there is the really bizarre topics. The stuff that you either think up randomly one slow Thursday evening or is obviously the result of one of the heaviest acid trips in history. I like to think that Rubber falls somewhere in the middle...of all three categories.Rubber pretty much had me at Lieutenant Chad's (Stephen Spinella) opening monologue. Hell, he gets out of the trunk of a car just to illustrate the point of ""no reason."" What makes this scene special is that it kind of breaks the fourth wall while also introducing the secondary storyline of the film. Lieutenant Chad explains what we are about to see to the camera and then it's revealed that there is a crowd of people there who are also about to watch what transpires on screen. Mind you, they're watching with binoculars and their fates are kind of questionable given the film's primary storyline, but it was one of the more unique ways to start off a film.Rubber is Robert's story. Who is Robert, you may ask? Robert's a tire; a car tire, to be precise. He wakes up one day to find out he likes to roll over anything that gets in his way, but once something more solid crosses his path like a beer bottle is when things get even crazier. Robert discovers that he has telepathic powers and he uses this gift to make things explode. It starts with a beer bottle and shifts to animals. As Robert lives life to the fullest just rolling around the desert and blowing up whatever his little nonexistent heart desires, he eventually stumbles onto a road into town where he becomes fixated with a woman. Not only that, but we get to see how his special powers work on humans...It's difficult to fully describe a film like Rubber. Its genius use of absurdity is practically overwhelming. The acting is a bit over the top at times, but really solid overall and fits the overall tone of the film like a glove. Stephen Spinella practically steals the show, but Jack Plotnick definitely has his moments. Okay, you got me. It's mostly the turkey scene and his heart to heart with the man in the wheelchair (Wings Hauser) that made Plotnick relevant. Rubber offers a little bit of everything though; comedy, drama, horror. There are a few seriously memorable one-liners buried in the film (""No, come on. It's not real life. Look at you, you have a stuffed toy alligator under your arm."") and it's kind of incredible how you almost come to understand the thought process of a car tire by the time the film ends.Rubber certainly isn't going to be a film for everyone, but you pretty much know what you're getting into with the trailer. The people who hate it probably have justifiable reasons; it's ridiculous, it's unbelievable, it's impossible; it's the dumbest thing ever. It's hard to argue with any of that, but I loved it for all of those reasons. Some people may see ridiculousness, but I saw originality, creativity, and unpredictability. Isn't that better than most of the clich&eacute; tripe that somehow makes all this money at the box office?Rubber is brainless fun covered by a veil of uncertainty. If you can accept the outlandish premise, then it's incredibly entertaining. Rubber has that same kind of vibe that Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans does; it's bizarre and eccentric on the surface, but kind of brilliant at its core. It'd probably be fair to call Rubber cheese, as well. But dammit if it's not some of the richest cheese I've ever tasted.",Positive
"Each episode is filled with interesting villains and story lines.  Character backgrounds are being explained well, and still fit.  I'm not sure how the new conspiracy is going to run, but the setup is tempting.  This season is just as good as the first.",Positive
"One must suspend reality and assume psychology is a valid form of &#34;seeing &#34; the human makeup, and that philosophy is nonexistent.  Furthermore, the issue of Volition must be sprinkled loosely but never consistently throughout the plot.

"like the movie because they show all the scenes that the show have to cut off because of time, so you are able to get the story better, and i but them , so i can watch as much as i want , and really get the story line. so i love buying the story on amazon and downloading the to my computer and watching them on my roku. doctor who is the best. great show.",Positive

"I was very taken with this movie.  A young Chinese orphan girl is profoundly grateful to her long-time Australian sponsor for providing the funds to give her a decent life.  The sponsor, a lonely, depressed, and withdrawn prison inmate, gets a new chance at life after encountering the girl whose life he has transformed.  I was touched by the story and found it inspiring.  Some of the criticisms laid out in the reviews here may have merit, but these problems didn't ruin the film for me at all.  Glad I watched it.",Positive
"Who are the target audience here?!  It is offensive, and not funny at all.  Could not continue for more than 10 minutes.  Tried to give it a chance but the show never got better.  Had bad teachers but this is just outright awful.  It gives teachers such an underserved bad rep and for what. Sorry but I don't get it nor see any comedy value in this.",Negative
I really like these types of shows.  the only thing upsetting is I have watched the entire series from 1 thru 3.  Get to 4 and now they want to charge.  I already pay Amazon for my Roku and don't feel this is right.  But love the show.,Positive
"I love this show! Each season just gets better and better! I own 3 seasons already and have the tv pass for season 6, so I get them as they air on TV. Neat! This series explores the things that modern science is afraid to touch, and the guests that they have on are knowledgable in their respective fields and are enjoyable to watch. If you are into the mysteries that abound on this planet and beyond, then this is a must see. Thanks...",Positive
Tosh.0 is not for me.  I find his humor pedantic and crass.  I know many people enjoy this show.  So if you like your humor on the bawdy side maybe this one is for you.,Negative

"Vivid colours, a nice glimpse at the early sixties, cigarettes and alcohol at the office.  This season, while staying with the same spirit as the previous two, has a better plot in terms of the business of advertizing, but disappoints a little in relationship content.  In particular, Christina Hendricks does not appear enough and a previous subplot involving the fantasies of her new husband in season 2 is ignored here.  Worth watching, though!",Positive
I had never heard of this show till i saw it on prime.  I thought it was wonderful.  It has great characters and plots with really good comedy relief.,Positive
"Great characters, good acting, would have given it 5 stars except it is getting a little too dark this season for us.  I like to feel like the good guys are winning once in a while and so far this season all the good guys are getting the stuffing kicked out of them while the bad guys are walking around free and easy in a wave of complete sinister actions.",Positive
"This movie captures a good idea, but does so very poorly.  There are a couple good scenes here but they are largely outweighed by the bad and the very bad.  I give this two disfigured alien thumbs down.This found footage film opens with the following caption: &#34;The following is actual leaked footage from the US Air Force.&#34;  It's cute when obviously untrue stories masquerade as true stories just to add mood or generate buzz.  The Fourth Kind (2009) had people rushing to Google to check stats of people disappearing and FBI investigations in Gnome, Alaska.  They did it well.  Although that was about all they did well.&#34;For centuries, people have been disappearing on and around Brown Mountain, North Carolina.  Locals believe the disappearances are directly linked with sightings of THE BROWN MOUNTAIN LIGHTS.&#34;  News casts, accounts from locals and witnesses, and testimonials from paranormal experts follow.  These segments represent one of few things that were done well in this movie.A family goes on a camping trip in the Brown Mountains.  The parents and kids are somewhat likable, normal people and their trip is filmed by their youngest son.  On their first night, the kids see lights in the sky moving in a way no star possibly could.The acting is far from top notch.  When the father gets them lost and loses his temper his behavior is totally unfounded.  When they run out of gas (which I don't see happening on a family road trip into the mountains) the family tension escalates and the father becomes rage-y, again unconvincingly.  Then again, even if they nailed their lines, the writing wasn't great either.  They come by several abandoned minivans and SUVs&#8230;as if some camping family Rapture had taken them all, leaving their cars and camping gear behind like a scene from The Walking Dead but without the walkers or corpses.We come across all the standard alien invasion film tropes.  Birds becomes disoriented and fly into things creating jump scares, obscured film of extra terrestrial figures in the darkness, lights in the sky, satellite interference, alien mind control telepathy attacks a la Independence Day (1996), aliens examining humans, tractor beams, monstrous alien sounds&#8230;you name it, these filmmakers borrowed it.  Almost none of this is executed well.  But there is one really cool, brief scene in the entire movie when a tractor beam gets someone, cracking and contorting their body while being levitated.The aliens follow the most simple of paradigms.  They're tall, lanky, grey-skinned, big-eyed, four-fingered extra terrestrials that sound, at times, like the Predator (1987) mating with a velociraptor while slitting a pig's throat.  Later we hear them communicate with the bubbly blip sounds from Signs (2002).First-time director Matty Beckerman does a hardly serviceable job delivering an entertaining movie.  The biggest faults are clearly found in the writing (also done by a first-time writer) and acting, especially the loner mountain man the family encounters--worst performance in the movie by far.  There are some pacing issues as well, with some seriously dull lulls between periods of action.  This movie actually goes from okay, to bad as we transition from the first act.  It just seems to get worse and worse and the film wears on.Maybe I'd take a chance at whatever this director does next, but I won't get my hopes up.  At one point in the movie the mother describes Brown Mountain saying &#34;It's like Deliverance, minus the anal rape.&#34;  As far as my enjoyment of this movie goes&#8230;well&#8230; it's like Deliverance, with the anal rape.  There were short segments of this film that were done well, but too much was poorly for me to recommend this to anyone.",Negative
"Unfortunately, I don't have time to read the books.  One day!This is one of my favorite shows.  There's suspense, mystery, drama, tension and chemistry - all the things I love.  I have not been disappointed since I first started watching this series last season, mid season.  All the actors (and actresses) are convincing as their characters.Who tried to kill Branch?  He still looks awful, which is a sign of good acting and is a testament to the make-up department's skills.Why is Vic still being stalked?Will Henry be exonerated?What's going on between Vic and Walt?Will Walt ever open up to someone besides Vic?My favorite episode just aired last night.

"The first two seasons of 30 ROCK the series managed to accumulate every imaginable award, not merely Golden Globes and Emmys, but the highly prestigious Peabody.  TV Critics proclaimed it one of the greatest comedy series in TV history.  Despite all this, no one was watching the series.  NBC renewed it twice simply because it was far and away its most critically acclaimed show.  And as I said, it had a shelf full of awards to prove it.  In accepting the show's first Emmy show creator Tina Fey summed it up perfectly:  ""I'd like to thank our dozens and dozens of viewers.""Then came the 2008 election and John McCain chose as his running mate a photogenic but outrageously under qualified governor from Alaska.  She was a comically awful choice, but for a while not everyone realized that.  Then on Saturday Night Live Tina Fey returned to portray Sarah Palin.  Her impersonation devastated Palin's public perception and more or less destroyed her political career.  It helped that many of the most hilarious things that she said were incredibly close to what Palin actually said.  While her impersonation was not crucial to McCain's loss, it definitely played a role.  But in addition to the political effects, Tina Fey's Sarah Palin called attention to her and by extension 30 ROCK to a degree not previously possible.  In its third season, 30 ROCK's dozens of fans grew to millions.  NBC suddenly had a hit show.Before going on, we should pause and reflect on this.  Today the networks do not exhibit much patience with shows.  If they are not instant hits, they are canceled.  Even if they get considerable critical acclaim, like PUSHING DAISIES, they will still get canceled.  30 ROCK had survived only because it got such an extreme amount of critical acclaim.  Its critical success more or less tied NBC's hands.  But my point is that after two low rated seasons, the show was a sudden hit.  I wish the networks would keep in mind that great shows always have a chance to become hits.  In fact, they have greater chances than the vast majority of new shows.  Patience with good shows will usually pay off.And what a brilliant show it remained in Season Three.  No doubt their collection of awards will grown once again and it will deserve it.  30 ROCK isn't merely the best comedy show on TV right now, but one of the best ever, possibly the best ever after only ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  Absolutely everything was perfect.  The writing was simply jaw dropping, with the jokes spilling out at a breathtaking pace.  Most comedy shows pad out the script, pacing the jokes because they don't know if they can keep coming up with the good ones, spacing the jokes with mildly humorous dialogue.  That isn't the way of Tina Fey and her team of writers.  They just assault the viewer with jokes, one right after another.  There are so many jokes that you simply can't keep up with them.  You just can't digest all of them.  What is more, sometimes the jokes are presented not one at a time, but in layers, two or three operating at the same time.  The jokes are verbal and they are also visual.  I still can't get the image of Liz Lemon showing her female friends her yoga pose out of my mind.This is as brilliant a set of characters as has been seen since the Bluth family made their premature exit from television.  Liz Lemon is an absolutely brilliant character, a lead character plagued by feet of clay.  Liz never really does the right thing for the right reason, but at most does the right thing for the wrong reasons.  She might not have an evil bone in her body, but neither does she have a good one.  Much the same is true of the magnificently self-absorbed Jack Donaghy.  Everything he does, no matter how bizarre, is done to further the interests of Jack Donaghy.  And Kevin the Page is one of the most unexpected hit characters on TV.  I'm sure when they started the series they knew he was going to be good, but who knew he would be as good as he ended up?  I'm sure they were confident that Tracy Jordan was going to be a great character, and they were right.  And Jenna Maroney might even surpass Liz and Jack in seeing the world as revolving around herself.  What makes this incredible group of characters even more incredible is that every actor portraying them is extraordinary.  Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin are simply the two best comic performers on TV and together they have created one of the great comic duos in TV history.There were some great comic arcs in Season Three.  Jack has a bizarre and out of character romance with his mother's nurse, played by Salma Hayek.  There is an unexpected glitch in it when her mother hates Jack because of his sharp resemblance to a villain in a Mexican soap (the villain is also portrayed by Alec Baldwin).  Liz persists in her efforts to adopt a child.  She also has a near romance with a very good looking neighbor, played to perfection by Jon Hamm, better known as Don Draper on MAD MEN.  Jenna wears herself out by simultaneously continuing to appear in THE GIRLIE SHOW while starring in an unauthorized biopic based on Janis Joplin (its being unauthorized meaning that in singing the Janis-like songs they can't use the real lyrics, something that leads to excellent results).  In short, hilarity results, again and again.The season ends on a highlight.  Jack learns the identity of his father, who just happens to need a kidney.  Much to his relief, Jack learns that he is not compatible, so they need to find a new donor.  So Jack twists the arms of Elvis Costello and other musicians to do a celebrity single.  The season ends with a group of musicians begging in a video for a kidney for Jack's dad.  Those performing on ""Kidney Now!"" include Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Clay Aiken, Mary J. Bilge, Steve Earle, two of the Beastie Boys, Adam Levine of Maroon 5, Norah Jones (who proudly sings that she is sober), Cyndi Lauper (who confesses that she is not), Sara Bareille, Michael Moby, Michael McDonald, rapper Talib Kweli, Wyclef Jean of the Fugees, Rhett Miller of the Old 97s, Robert Randolph, and Rachael Yamagata.  All in all, it is a pretty amazing assemblage of talent for a fake music video.So, once again 30 ROCK was a show that was hitting on all cylinders.  And now the ratings are strong enough that those of us who adore the show don't have to worry that the season that has just ended will be the last.",Positive
"Jane Rizzoli, played by Angie Harmon, is drop-dead gorgeous and so much more attractive than her partner, Moira, who I would describe as very pretty. I'm surprised that Moira is described as the attractive half of the duo. Angie is probably the most attractive actress working in TV today and she has a relaxed and natural acting style that is very appealing. In hot competition for the number one spot  is the actress who plays Becket, on Castle. And running a very close third is Attorney Reagan on Blue Bloods, and she is a good actress, as well. I wish I could remember their names; they are not unforgettable. Any one of them deserves the title of 'Best looking TV actress.'",Positive
So far it is holding my interest.  I want to know what happens next.  I am always fascinated by the ideas/visions of the future portrayed in movies even the Jetsons.,Positive
"So you think graft and corruption are brand-new products of modern society? Let Brian Unger lead you around this wonderful nation of ours and you will discover two things that shaped the states: 1) Water...or the lack of it. 2) Money...and a willingness to share it with some esteemed lawmakers in Washington, D.C.Unger takes us from coast to coast and border to border; he discovers the often seamy goings on that gave our states their individual shapes. He interviews the citizens, drives the highways, rows on the lakes and eats lots of barbecue! He discovers that there are little islands of rebels who have declared their independence from this great land of ours, and they are only partially kidding!Colorful, scenic, interesting and entertaining, this fascinating DVD from Amazon.com is a painless way to get a little more insight into how this amazing nation grew.",Positive

"I can, and have been, critical of Lifetime made-for-TV movies for ripping &#34;based on actual events&#34; cases from the headlines and turning them into rather lurid fodder for fictionalized dramatic recreations. It is one of their go-to genres. Sometimes you don't need all the sensationalistic melodrama when the tale itself is both compelling and fascinating. And in the simplicity of its presentation, &#34;Abducted: The Carlina White Story&#34; is one of the network's more heartfelt entries into this overstuffed format. Level-headed and real, this accounting benefits from an understated tone and (at least) one truly dynamic performance. While the screenplay sometimes takes some major shortcuts which sacrifice significant parts of the actual story, it is still one of the better efforts from Lifetime that I've seen in quite some time. And, in all candor, it is a film that I had almost no interest in seeing! Well, I'm glad I didn't listen to myself. What do I know anyway?&#34;Abducted&#34; tells the story of a girl who was stolen from the hospital shortly after her birth. As the parents pursue any lead, the case makes headlines that only intensify when they also seek to hold the hospital legally responsible. As they come to terms with the difficulties of losing their daughter, the abductor proceeds to raise the child for the next two decades! The case once again made headlines when Carlina White, as an adult, began to unravel the secret and seek out her real family. She is placed in an untenable position. Should she embrace the family she has never known? And if so, does that mean she has to cut ties with her entire existence. It's a knotty dilemma, handled reasonably well in the hands of director Vondie Curtis-Hall. I wish the story would have spent more time on the arising suspicions and the process of what happens, but much of that is left to the imagination. Her investigation into her identity consists of a couple of Internet searches, that's how little effort is spent on this portion of the tale.But despite its shortcomings, &#34;Abducted&#34; should be lauded for its incredible lead performance by Aunjanue Ellis. Ellis plays the unstable woman responsible for the kidnapping, and it's a role of great passion and vigor. Ellis always seems to be the most unpredictable actress in whatever role she is undertaking, and here that really pays off. You can't take your eyes off her when she's on the screen, and I missed her when she was not. Other major players include Sherri Shepherd, a nice change of pace as the other mother, and Keke Palmer as a grown Carlina. Overall, this is such a fascinating story, you'll definitely want to see how it plays out. It sometimes falls into the trap of the typical TV movie by-the-numbers narrative, but Ellis is always quick to give the film a jolt of energy just when it needs it the most!

"update February 2010: Phoenix was just photographed clean shaven and no longer doing his rap act.  I hope this means he is about to return to film!original review:Joaquin Phoenix bizarrely made the rounds after this film, looking like a grizzly bear and stating that he was leaving movies so that he could be a rapper.  Cut to him performing as a rapper--he was atrocious!  Some say that this is a joke he is playing for a film his brother-in-law Casey Affleck is making.  I sure hope so.  Because the truth of the matter is that Phoenix is one hell of an actor.  After all, Paltrow is no slouch.  She has an Oscar on her mantle.  But he steals the thunder from everyone in this film.  He dominates it from the first scene and never lets go.He plays the Jewish son of a mom and pop business operation which has another mom and pop as a partner.  His parents and the partner start pushing this young woman for him as a highly desirable wife.  In all good conscience, in the movie at least, she comes across as better looking, with a better personality and in short, with a lot going for her.  He actually seems lucky to have come up with someone  this good.  He plays his guy as no charismatic ball of fire. He plays him as an ok guy but no one you'd be dying to date much less marry. (Phoenix has played the opposite with equal effectiveness, exuding charisma and sexuality, again showing how good his acting chops really are).Now here come the wrench.  Gwenyth Paltrow appears and she is clearly above his touch.  She is involved with an older, married professor. She is also a complete flake.  You just know, if you aren't someone who is smitten with her, that she is nothing but trouble.  She vacillates constantly over what she wants and flits around from interest to interest.  I doubt you'd want her as a friend. So, of course, Phoenix falls for her like the proverbial ton of bricks.To say anymore would ruin the plot.  I thought it was a terrific film with an unusual plot line.  It was focused, tight, well scripted and brilliantly acted.I hope no one buys a single rap record he makes!",Positive

"Although the premise of this movie was somewhat intriguing, the characters, editing, pacing, and acting were not.  I've heard of slow, but THIS was slower than a 3-legged turtle.  It seems that aliens have landed and occupied earth six years ago, there is now an ""infected"" zone where you cannot leave, and a wall has been constructed in keep people in/out.  Yeah, I get the symbolism there, but this movie becomes an exercise in a very lame excuse to tell a love story.  I didn't care for either character, the monsters look like floating octopi, and I never felt the characters were in peril of anything--except their own insipidness (if that's even a word).  So go ahead and watch...BORE yourself to death...",Negative
I have been marathoning all of this show and I have to admit it holds my interest and I look forward to getting to the next episode. Lots happen and the show moves at a good pace.

Don't waste your time or money watching this show. 3 red-necks and a woman running around in the woods looking for big-foot banging on  trees and yelling to get a response. either way its not as good as I thought it would be.

"This is one of very few current TV shows which is worth my time to watch. Most of the shows on TV now are vulgar, violent, unfunny, or intent on pushing an offensive social or sexual agenda - even the so-called animated comedies. Even the game shows are leaning way Left. Most Reality shows are just plane stupid and fall into the above description as well. Though NCIS is often more GP than G rated, it has great characters and good plots.",Positive

"this show just keeps getting better. We are now into the 3rd series and the characters are well established. I still miss the father of the cop character from the first season , but other than that you have a fine ensemble cast. In this one 'audrey' must stop a troubled person from killing off people by drowning them. Is that person evil or is it not their fault that their trouble is killing people off? You never know with this show , as the mystery has played out over the seasons we learn more but there is still more to learn. Which is a good thing. I miss the chemistry between the two leads; parker and the cop. And the mysterious new big city detectives storyline is intriguing. But you don't have to have watched all the previous episodes to enjoy this one.  the hd looked good on this one. Better than on csi by a long shot.",Positive

He needs a good ass whipping, spoiled brat is really stupid.Dokota is still entertaining. Mostly because he fixes things that most people would never be able to. Despite it not always working out.Really my only gripe this season is the 19 year old brat is back. I get it they are pandering to a younger demographic, but dam the kid is annoying. Throws tantrums and the grownups have to talk him down all the time.",Positive

"Parody of romantic comedies is a huge disappointment given all of the talent involved.  The idea was to do a meta romantic comedy that comments on all of the clich&eacute;s of the genre while also indulging in them--it feels like two thirds of the movie features the actors talking in air quotes.  Unfortunately with his focus on being clever writer director David Wain forgot to bring any laughs.  Seriously, I've seen god-awful straight-to-video horror movies by The Asylum that were much funnier than this.Not that it matters but if They Came Together really wanted to parody Hollywood romantic comedies then Amy Poehler is miscast--she isn't pretty enough to be a lead in an actual Hollywood romantic comedy and would likely end up playing the sassy best friend.  Paul Rudd, on the other hand, has the leading man good looks but he isn't capable of elevating weak material, which is what he's stuck with here.Some people may be able to get on the same wavelength as They Came Together but I found it to be an unfunny drag that was torture to sit through--I actually stopped the movie several times and pondered whether it was worth trying to make it to the end or not.  It wasn't.",Negative
"All the things you assume about ""Need for Speed"" are all pretty accurate; it is juvenile, another ""Fast and Furious"" type movie and it is pretty much from beginning to end a car race, car chase, car crash type movie. While you may not like that type of thing, ""Need for Speed"" thankfully has more going on than just what its videogame origin promises. Fortunately, Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad), who plays Tobey Marshall, is a fantastic and passionate actor and he's joined by an entire group of actors and characters that will stick in your mind long after the film is over.Watching the film, I couldn't help thinking that Tony Scott and Don Simpson left a mark on the world they have left behind. I kept thinking that it had that ""Top Gun"", ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Days of Thunder"" type feel to it. Everything in the film was just larger than life with beautiful sceneries, machismo splashed with comedy and characters that are as much over-the-top as the premise of their actions. Tobey Marshall is the `Maverick' type; loaded with skill but he can't seem to control it when he needs to. Maybe my love of those great Scott/Simpson/Bruckheimer movies of the 80s clouded my vision, but I felt it and it was a good thing.Tobey Marshall is an A-class street racer and with that comes a strange sensation that you will have to have to overcome in order to enjoy the film.""Need for Speed"" is based upon a videogame and with that, you have to remember that this is absurdity. You have to think of ""Need for Speed"" as you would have thought about the Sylvester Stallone movie ""Death Race 2000"" from the 70s. When Marshall and his racing partners crash and weave through normal every day traffic, you will hate them because they are the kind of people you would hate if you were driving to work on a Tuesday morning, but you have to forget that. If you can't overlook that, then you won't enjoy the film.Despite some poorly plotted and unrealistic moments toward the end, ""Need for Speed"" remains a cut above the rest when it comes to action/racing films. If you're assuming that it is just a bunch of racing and ridiculousness, than you would be wrong and right. It is about racing and ridiculousness, but within that are beautifully drawn characters with passionate purpose and endless humor and excitement for what they do. The intelligence of the driving and the brilliance of the racing sequences put ""Need for Speed"" over-the-top. Thanks to Aaron Paul and Imogen Poots, who plays a character that most men can only dream about, ""Need for Speed"" is endlessly interesting and impossible not to care about.",Positive
The superb acting by Glen Close makes this a great series!  Never get enough of watching the multiple plots and surprises.,Positive
"Fans of Phyllis Logan, who plays Mrs. Hughes on Downton Abbey, will enjoy seeing her in this show. She plays the often tough, but ultimately heroic Squadron Leader Helen Knox. The story has a few puzzling twists, and there's way too much military trigger-happiness. The sets have that ""BBC Drama"" familiarity, yet they somehow seem out-of-place for this story. Nonetheless, if you like Phyllis Logan and/or Downton Abbey, then this show is definitely worth watching!",Negative
We had not seen this series and enjoyed being able to get up to date.  Very captivating and have recommended it to others.,Positive
"I grew up watching Dexter's Laboratory, and the geniuses on this show are no Dexter and Mandark. The girl on this show is no Dee Dee. When I watched Dexter's Laboratory, there were a lot of funny scenes from episodes. Plus, it was brought back for more entertainment. I would rather watch that show than this which doesn't seem to have any funny moments coming up if it got the green light, or lasting at least two seasons. Plus, we have Phineas and Ferb, and Johnny Test (opposite genders) right now! We don't want something that's going to be a knock-off of either cartoon. Sorry, Jessica!",Negative
"This show is worth watching. It only gets better as the seasons continue to build on a fantastically built foundation. It gives a fun plot each week, but what really holds it together is the amazing, personal character driven plots that underpin the series, bonding us to the show. You don't just love the stories of what the characters do, but who the characters are. The writters do a great job of growing these characters and letting us get to know them (& love them) more & more.",Positive
This is a good TV series to follow up on the movies.  The plot and characters are good and the story line is very strong.

Again, I wish all episodes were available at a reasonable rate. Fortunately, belonging to Prime has helped the cost.",Positive

"This film starts with a six minute monologue, but once you get through that, the campy fun begines. Now, it does decend into dorkyness at times, and the sets and special effects are kind of of lame, but in this film, it adds to the fun- usually stupid fun- that makes this movie work.

I could not stand any of these characters at all just annoying low life people that just did dumb things for no reason at all. If it wasn't because of that it would be an alright alien movie. The alien was kinda cool looking and the effects weren't too bad. The overall setting and atmospherewas that good either and just felt like a rushed movie for some reason. Not a fan but that's just me and there are way better alien movies out there. If your bored than I guess check it out.,Negative

We started watching and I didn't mind the rough draft it really helped me explain what a cartoon really is and how they are made from drawings. (or used to, I guess a lot more now are computer)The show was more about fun and imagination I get that, but it was so quick to go to her imaginary place that it didn't explain where she was going or even where she started.  Also, the scarecrow was too forgetful, the tin girl was cute but seemed really sad, and the lion was cowardly and it was sweet that they worked with him I think after watching a few episodes it may catch on a bit more but the first time watch was more about me watching.",Negative

"This is another sloppy metaphor of all the struggles and compromises an artist must go through to produce something of any quality.  Don't expect any of it to make sense in a literal way.  It would have been more compelling if the sheriff had sued, threatened, or even framed him for a crime in order to get his ""fair share.""  The ""children"" and ""Poe"" seemed like irrelevant filler.",Negative
"This series is a good one with the potential to be great. With individual characters that lend toward a Buffy feel to the show in some ways, it definitely stands on its own and is still unique. I felt this season to be a vast improvement on the first, my only complaint is that allowing other characters like Hank to grow within the world while leaving Juliette behind feels contrived, like it's been done (a lot) before and holds the show back in that the writers had to keep backtracking to include her story. That said I would still recommend this show and I'm looking forward to season 3.",Positive

"""Mutant Chronicles""(2009)----------------------------------------NOTE: mild spoilers below----------------------------------------This dystopian, post-apocalyptic, alternate/future-world action flick has a familiar feel... Indeed, much of the film is taken up with self-parody, gently poking fun at the genre in much the same way that 2004's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" lampooned the old action serials of the 1930s.  The story is set in a grimy, steampunkish world where the First World War is still being fought in the trenches and corporations rule entire continents. The endless war is interrupted when the combatants unknowingly uncork a mystic seal that held in check the mutant hordes from a distant planet, imprisoned there millennia ago by a religious order that is now run by the ever-lispy John Malkovitch. As the mutants massacre and multiply, it quickly becomes clear that Earth is doomed and an evacuation is planned. Malkovitch's high priest knows the secrets of the mutant horde and taps Ron Perlman (star of ""Hell Boy"") to recruit an elite squad for a military suicide mission to put the genies back in the bottle. The mismatched, misanthropic anti-team has been seen a bazillion times before (Aliens, Predator, et al) but the film's producers are conscious of their cliches, and take advantage of the situation to pause for some kitschy, campy joke shots -- overly-heroic poses and obligatorily grim, determined speeches.  They know fans are just tapping their fingers waiting for the action to start, so you might as well have a little fun with the formula, in a Sam Raimi-like way.The action really kicks in during the film's second half, and then the pace becomes relentless. ""Mutant Chronicles"" is not a tremendously innovative or imaginative movie, but fans will be pleased with this high-octane sci-fi/creature feature splatterfest.  Besides, any film where we get to see John Malkovitch get torn apart by demons is fine by me.  I'd give it a 3.5.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",Positive

"I never would have guessed Serious Moonlight would live up to the excitement based on the description but I was totally wrong.  Even more surprisingly, the way the story eventually changes is somewhat complex and I was *not* expecting a degree of sophistication to the writing whatsoever.  A wife (played by Meg Ryan) duct tapes her husband to a toilet after he tells her that he's been seeing another woman and that the two of them plan to run away together on a trip the next day.  So... what does Meg Ryan do?  Why, she smacks her husband over the head with a flower pot, knocking him out cold on the floor!  When he awakes, he's wrapped up tight in tape and unable to move.This is definitely a comedy intended for women since the storytelling and atmosphere feels sort of feminine.  However due to the amazingly well-written way the storyline unravels with several twists and turns (including the mistress eventually playing a more important role and, more importantly, robbers coming into the picture to wreak havoc when they spot a golden opportunity to do so) I have no choice but to declare Serious Moonlight a comedy that *both* men and women can enjoy.  The many twists and turns guarantees that both men and women will be surprised and laughing hysterically at the way these events unfold.  Serious Moonlight manages to successfully weave a subtle touch to the story together in a way that both men and women will be able to appreciate.I really don't want to spoil more to the storyline since I feel I'd be giving too much away.  It's the kind of comedy that demands the viewer to watch every aspect carefully so as not to miss anything.  I just think it's hilarious that Meg Ryan ties her husband to a toilet and tries to reminisce about their many years in a relationship and doing so in a serious way assuming the husband will be able to think contently and reasonably without any concern for the fact he's tied up, LOL!  This is just one aspect of the storyline- the second half of the movie changes the situation entirely.  Great writng and highly recommended.",Positive
"Great television, everything about this show is amazing. I cant wait for more episodes with season 2. Reagan era period piece done with great accuracy.",Positive
"This tale is really sloooooooow in the first third and then it picks up some. Inspired by the accused murdered, Robert Durst.Gosling plays a wealthy man named Mark who marries a working class girl named Katie (played by Kirsten Dunst). Their marriage begins with promise but his unstable mood swings create friction to the point where we are left wondering did he murder her or not?Arguably too many flashbacks and back stories did damage to the tale.That said it had its moments in which some scenes were done well, especially when the Dunst character is trying to get certain information from her husband's office.The budget for this picture was $20M but it didn't even clear $1M at the Box Office. I'm not terribly surprised.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B minus to B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2012 to January 2013 (streamed).",Negative
"This series started off decently enough, but as it has gone on, it has, in my opinion, become less and less believable. It seems to me that any advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel wouldn't mess around with bombs and lasers. If they really wanted to exterminate the native species, they most likely would have used some kind of genetically engineered bio-weapon that would have a near 100% kill rate. Also, some of the episodes have become more and more like a soap with the various on and off again relationships.I have noticed that this series has been renewed for a third season to air in the summer of 2013. I am not sure that I will waste the time on in next summer.",Negative
Exciting action and an honest to goodness American hero you can enjoy!,Positive
"It's a bit contrived, but I like this a lot better than Pretty Little Liars. They can go a lot of different ways with this.",Positive
"A peek at the Brits in post war London and how they cope with change - from a world power to mature and historic nation.  Lots of undercurrent and back-story here, spying, love, control and cheating.  Great acting and sets fit into the 50s motif - sort of a mad men older sister story.Watch and enjoy.",Positive
Too much talking with irrelevant dialog. Not my kind of show. Did not see a point to the episode I watched.Will not watch agaian,Negative
"When Kevin Sorbo was spotting me in the gym the other day, he wouldn't shut up about The Santa Suit, a Christmas movie he made for the Hallmark Channel some few years ago (2010). I'd just broken my collar bone recently so I figured I needed that spotter on the incline bench press, so I let dude natter on. I didn't tell him that I'd seen the movie and had thought it pretty good.While using the bow flex, he told me the plot: In The Santa Suit, Sorbo learns about compassion and charity and good will towards men. Sorbo is Drake Hunter, mercenary CEO of a toy company who, even during the season of giving, is all about the bottom line. Drake has run Hunter Toys for the past five years, since his dad passed away. And in those five years, he's habitually mistreated his staff, he's condoned horrific working conditions. He regards Santa Claus as the greatest promotional image in history. Note his impatience when his impassioned personal assistant, Marge (Rosemary Dunsmore), who's been with the toy company for thirty years, blurts out: ""Christmas is about being over the top. You sing songs you don't sing the rest of the year. You hang parasitic moss on the ceiling so you can kiss someone you love underneath it."" Oh, it was a sad day when Christmas went corporate.Sorbo talked on while he kept the heavy bag steady (several times he asked me to take it easy; I got a wicked left hook): The premise doesn't coalesce until Drake attends a quality report meeting from the R & D Dept. There, he eyeballs the prospective mall Santas and eyeballs one in particular, him what's calling himself ""Kriss Krandall"" and bemoaning the toy company's calculating methods. What are the odds that Kriss Krandall is the real deal? And that he sets out to enchant Drake Hunter? Suddenly, Drake finds that no one recognizes him, that when others look at him, they instead see the beardy face and unsvelte figure of one of them mall Santas. Drake, whose body mass index is 20, is chagrined. It takes a while for this newreality to set in for him.Thought insane by his employees, thrown out of his own demesne, mistaken for a vagrant, he makes his way to a homeless shelter where cheery social worker Nancy Baxter (Jodie Dowdall) finds him a gig as a Santa for the Dobson's Toy Store at the mall. It's there and it's when in the company of Nancy, who adores Christmas, and that one uncommunicative little girl who keeps dropping in at Dobson's (and can't quite say what she wants for Christmas) that Drake at last stumbles onto the spirit of Christmas and so sheds his cynicism. And maybe even his weird co-worker, Sebastian the Lebanese mall elf (Darrell Faria), plays a part in Drake's transformation. Faria is the movie's darkly comic presence, an over-the-top aspiring actor who sees his mall elf more as an opportunity to indulge in Dark Elf cosplay, complete with wicked tears of blood. Except in Santa's Village, bloody tears on a Santa's helper is a big nuh-uh. Drake's parting advise to Sebastian as they go to greet the children: ""Don't make them cry or scream."" Heh.I like The Santa Suit, not that I confessed this to Sorbo. It presents all the sappy ingredients of a holiday picture, but it's well done and well acted. Sorbo toes that line between restraint and trotting out his comic skills, of which we saw glimpses back when he was playing Hercules. The only issue I have with the film is in how Drake's spell is lifted because of something he does (and then tries to excuse because he owns the company). To me, that was a jarring moment. Maybe you'll see what I mean. Anyway, it's a funny movie with enough warmhearted bits and a nice holiday message, and I do recommend it. Maybe I should've said as much to Sorbo before we parted ways. But he wanted to get on the thigh abductor machine and I had to tell him not to be ridiculous. When I left him he was on the yoga mat trying out the Happy Baby Pose. Kevin Sorbo, you so crazy.",Positive
"Note: this program is cancelled by the network.The cast, headed up by Ron Livingston who played the lead role in ""Office Space"" (available on amazon.com Video on demand which I highly recommend) as the second in command of the mission which is to visit several planets in six years, and who narrates the series via talk over, is talented enough to put conviction and believability into the roles, especially the roles of the astronauts on the spaceship. The script and dialogue move at a moderate pace (some may find it too slow) and so demands some patience from the viewer.From the pilot of this new series, it is very obvious that this is not going to be a ""Roger Ramjet,"" or ""Flash Gordon,"" type good guys wastes bad guys space flick. So be forewarned . . . it is a psychological Sci-Fi genre' although the technical work on the CG and other graphics is respectable enough.Through a recurrent series of flashbacks, the current six year mission is merged, blurred, related, or whatever ya want to call it, with a previous mission headed by Ron Livingston and the now commander of the current mission. During that mission to Mars, Livingston is ordered to leave two members of the crew behind as a tremendous storm is approaching just before the module is to blast off from Mars; and he does which burdens both he and his fellow mission astronauts with a great deal of guilt. Further complicating the plot, Livingston was romantically involved with one of those left on Mars, while at the same time there is great doubt as to whether they really had to leave the two behind, or whether they could have in fact waited a few minutes and saved them while safely leaving - an error in judgment that would have been made by the mission head back on earth who also happens to be heading up the current mission too.There are similarities to other well known Sci-Fi films such as Solaris and 2001 right down to an vague similarity in music to Solaris. These similarities are not blatant enough to be seen as rip-offs, IMO, but more like nods of acknowledgement and/or intended to evoke a relationship to those films which is completely acceptable as a cinematic device.The mild (relatively) sex scenes are understandable as a traditional way to attract a significant TV viewing audience, and are not exploitative, IMO, but enlarge on the relationships between the characters. The frequent flashbacks to events before the current mission I did find somewhat disruptive and wondered at times of their relevance to the plot. However, I did not find them as disruptive as the maddeningly frequent, disruptive and blatantly sexually exploitative sex scenes and vanilla content in such popular TV series as ""Lost.""I found the different nationalities and ethnicities enriching to the series so far, and fair although somewhat stereotypic; although a Hindu Indian, as in India with a first generation accent may seem clich&eacute;, it is not any more clich&eacute; than a white male who loves baseball and was born in a small town, and has a drunk for a father. I wonder, would a Christian of Indian heritage who speaks with a perfect English accent make the film more believable? Would an atheistic female Latino with an extremely strong libido or sex drive like the German woman seem believable?The object or thing in Bay 4 which seems to be the real one in control of this mission right down to who is included on the mission, is reminiscent of HAL in ""2001"", or Mother in ""Alien"" in that it has its own definite agenda for the space mission. The contents of Bay 4, what it really is, what its agenda is, its genesis, and how it took control of the mission, and why the mission leaders allow it to control the mission drives the tension in the film - and I for one am extremely intrigued. Actually, I'm just about besides myself with curiosity to the nature of what is in Bay 4. Well, it had better be good with all the build up.At any rate, the contents of Bay 4 manipulates the members of the mission both psychologically and physically, excludes two original members of the team by spontaneously giving them heart trouble just before the mission, and manipulates the selection of the current mission team members so that some very unlikely astronauts are included such as one who fails his swimming test, a test that is meant to immediately exclude anyone failing it.Interestingly, the ""thing"" in Bay 4 (at the time I am writing this the contents of Bay 4 is on the verge of being revealed I hope) doesn't seem to like using the mission for commercial exploitation by business interests back on earth; the mission members are scheduled to unveil a banner out in space for the ""Big Buster"" candy bar (or something like that) candy company on the eve of Halloween. To accomplish this, the contents of Bay 4 induces severe hallucinations in all but two of the mission astronauts which results in a somewhat humorous situation where all but two of them are trying to exit a bay door into outer space but are too terrified of their hallucinations to move. Two other members of the mission who couldn't make it to the exit bay are themselves very busy, one having PTSD flashback of the war in Chechenia, and the other attending to the hallucination of her dog dying.At this moment, just after viewing episode 8, I am waiting with bated breath for the next episode to see what in the heck is in Bay 4.To be continued . . . .",Positive
it's always a sad time when you reach the final season of characters you invested so much time in. Especially enjoyed the last two episodes the second to the last one reminded me of the Robert Rodriguez film in terms of the music that was used. there are numerous episodes that are more memorable than others. And of course some of these showcase the acting ability of each separate team member on the show.honestly think the corporate executive should turn loose of some mega bucks and start making movies based on the series the go deep into the various alien cultures that were shown the first 5 seasons,Positive
"Lately there have been a lot of movies about the Roman Empire's reach into the British Isles.  There was the King Arthur retelling with Clive Owen and Keira Knightley.  And soon after that was Colin Firth in the Last Legion.  Now we have Centurion, about a group of surviving roman centurions who struggle to reach friendly ground after their legion is destroyed by Picts.  Combining great scenery, bloody violence, raucous humor with betrayals and backstabbing, this movie shows life in the Roman Empire as brutal and bloody.  And yes, we have warrior babes, more than in previous sword-fighting movies.  The soundtrack was a disappointment; for a movie with scenery and cinematography like LOTR, the background music was totally forgettable.  Outside of that, this was an above-average action flick.",Negative
The setting was clever and appealed to my curiosity. The behind the scenes insights into the &#34;Classical Music&#34; world was a plus for me. The characters were interesting enough and less predictable. I think I can guess what the next episode may be but I think the writers might challenge predicatabilty based on some of the pilots twists. Promising .,Positive
"This is a good series with procedural episodes that have longer multi episode story lines mixed in. The way they tie the effects of an artifact to it's historical background is ingenious. I give this 3 stars because it's the multi episode story lines that being you back for more. The individual episode sorry lines can range from very good to very corny. Some of the special effects are sub par compared to the quality of the rest of the production. I also personally feel they tend to lighten a lot of the episodes up too much with unneeded and often poorly delivered humor. Some people however will feel this is the charm of the show. At the end of the day, if you like syfy and can look past (or enjoy) some cheesy humor or episodes that break up the good story lines then this site is very much work watching.",Negative
"Even into the movie the first few minutes, I was pretty sure I was going to hate it.  Lousy acting, that cheap feel, but then things turned around on a twist and I was hooked for the long run.  So glad I stayed with it.  Delightful movie!  Absolutely delightful.  I can't write a review any better than the best 5-star review, so go read that one, or do the smart thing and just watch the movie.",Positive
"[SOME SPOILERS INCLUDED]Halle Berry plays an astronaut, Molly Woods, who returns to earth after a long solo mission in space. Her scientist husband John, played by Goran Visnjic, awaits her at home, along with their little boy, who we quickly discover is a robot. Thus we embark on the beginning of several seemingly unconnected threads, which include outer space, supernatural happenings and the creation of an A.I.The problem is that it's all so clunky. For example, I'll paraphrase the dialogue at the investor meeting where John Woods asks for continued funding for his A.I. project. This is world changing stuff, and it's a meeting with the equivalent of Silicon Valley's top investors. Lots of brain power and big bucks in the room.Female investor in audience: Have you thought what would happen if it all goes wrong? You going to, um, terminate it?John Woods: You monster! Baby killer!Investor: MY child has a soul.John: You MONSTER!I've paraphrased, but that's more or less the gist of it. Really, inventor? You haven't had this debate many times over with all sorts of critics? You're SHOCKED? And when asking for a huge investment, you throw a fit of histrionics?And the ""no soul"" thing thrown out there like that by the potential investor. Could you be any more cliche? You came looking to invest and only now this occurred to you, like you haven't seen it and read it in every science fiction book and film ever made about the pitfalls of A.I.? Hello, to be an investor in Huge Big Buck Scientific World Changing event, don't you think you should know a LOT about the subject matter? It's not enough to just throw on some business-woman clothes.Then you have the Japanese ultra-rich guy who apparently controls the world and is Up To No Good. Not only does he look Japanese and has a Japanese name, but to make sure we get it that he is Japanese, they threw in a cherry tree in blossom behind him, and had him pour tea in a faux Japanese tea ceremony. After pouring the tea he immediately abandoned the ceremony thing and sat on the table drinking like you would any hot drink. It was in your face and oh so clunky and oh so ridiculous. A subtle writer who didn't want to shove things in your face would have shown him simply sitting at a normal desk without the stupid tree in the background and drinking a cappuccino. Or tea. Or anything.Just two examples of the clunkiness. I won't comment on more substantial things so as to not give away too much, but these examples are illustrative of the rest of the story.*sigh*This was after the premiere. I'll soldier on, I guess, and watch the next one next week. Such is life, one must lower one's head and keep at it. At least it was free.",Negative
"I can not say enough about this series.  In the spirit of Breaking Bad, and Prison Break, this edgy series uses a background of Zombies, but focuses on human nature.  It is well worth watching.....But like the aforementioned titles, you must start with Ep 1, Season 1, or don''t bother....it is well worth the investment in time, to see the characters evolve.  Watch the Sheriff's son...this young actor is doing a superb job of character development.This series is not for the faint of heart.  It is graphic in its depiction of blood and guts, but it is also strangely acceptable, unlike the ""Saw"" series of movies.",Positive
"History Channel's Vikings follows the legendary Ragnar Lothbrok.  I hate spoilers so I am going to try very hard not to give much away here.Travis Fimmel's portrayal of Ragnar has blown me away. He can be so very bold ,brave and lethal. Sometimes he gets the &#34;crazy twitch&#34; in his eye. The one that either leads to chaos or victory. Of course we can't forget his romantic side either. Given all of his alleged sons in literature, it is fair to say he was somewhat of a ladies man. Fimmel plays that up well too.The story of Lagertha is my favorite. Though her story is not only of Ragnar, it is intertwined in some places. You will see her here played by Katheryn Winnick. She has, IMHO, excelled at showing Lagertha's  strength, honor and pride.Some of the scenes can be a little graphic. Most of it during the battles and such. I don't find it too horrific but others may.The script is sprinkled with all kinds of myths and legends. I find myself looking stuff up after every episode. Trying to find out what it means, how it is linked and what could be next. I like that I can look it up online and better understand what's going on.",Positive
"I enjoyed this movie - probably because I like Jason Statham.  I would have given it 5 stars if the story behind his character's downfall had been better explained earlier in the movie.  But, it was still very entertaining and it's never painful to watch Jason Statham do almost anything!",Positive
"I know this series is on the &#34;bubble&#34; and I'm hoping that NBC gives it just one more season. There are so many directions they could take this, so many plot twists. Not too many shows out there that I make sure to watch. NBC give it another chance and quit with the month interruptions that kill ratings.",Positive
This is a very dark series with vivid crime scenes of grisly murders.  Not for the faint of heart.  Hugh Dancy is a super actor who does an excellent job of portraying a very sensitive very broken FBI agent.  Hannibal is bonechilling.  Very good series with a lot of plot twists.,Positive
Onion news empire was a smart and funny parody on the state of network and cable news in the 24/7 news cycle. I look forward to the next episodes.,Positive
Though physics are brought in to help the police in most cases they can't or don't solve the crime(s) and updates aren't given (thus what I have seen so far.) I think when putting together a series such as this with programs already product and shown that updates should be added after each program OR noted that the case is still cold.,Positive
"Very good series, characters have grown since season 1. This season develops the storyline of Audrey's purpose in Haven and builds the tension making it compelling to watch. You do really need to see season 1 before viewing this to really understand what is happening and why.",Positive
Lacks character depth and relies too much on shock value. For a series to be successfulit has to have more than this one provides.,Negative
"Good story line and acting.  Who's really in control of our lives, and when is deception realized enough for us to make the changes, or is it too late once the truth is realized.",Negative
This was hilarious! Love the Jerry moments.. They always make me laugh! Hope they do another one of these because there's already been some more great moments in the new season,Positive
"After several weeks of episodes that were hard hitting and emotional, this episode was a breath of fresh air. Bravo to Sutter on the blackmail scenes. It had me rolling with laughter at Venus Van Dam, Tig, and the rest of the guys. I can't wait to see what happens with the police chief's wife and the guys who are breaking into the homes. But for now I will just have watch it again for the comedy!",Positive
"This is one of my favrorite tv series. Yes, Patrick Jane always solves the murder and you wonder if his police counterparts could ever solve one by themselves. A little unrealistic at times but it is always entertainng. Mostly because Simon Baker does a terrific job of playing the compelling complex character, Patrick Jane.",Positive

the show mixes action and story pretty well. it captures the outlaw biker (from what i've seen) very well. there is just one minor problem. people from the inland valley of california don't use such big callege words. this is obvously written by someone with an education and not an outlaw biker from the valley.i just found this show and friends of mine say the other seasons are better. i can hardly waitand Katie Segal is HOT in her tight jeans,Positive
"When the whimsical ""Leverage"" arrived on the television scene in 2008, I had just finished watching the delightful British crime caper series ""Hustle.""  Needless to say, if you've sampled both programs--they share more than a passing similarity.  I know every ""Leverage"" fan was instantly enchanted by our merry band of mischievous do-gooders, but I just couldn't get the comparison out of my mind and the program lacked a bit of the easiness and subtlety of its like minded cousin from across the pond.  Subtlety is certainly never a word I will associate with ""Leverage,"" in fact, which usually plays so broadly and comically that it is often bordering on slapstick.  But, that's okay.  The erratic tone of the show soon steadied itself and the attractive cast stepped up with nimble comic performances.  A show about clever cons soon gave way to a show about clever con artists.  To me, ""Leverage"" works most successfully as a sly and humorous ensemble piece.Sure, there is often amusement to be had in the various cases (sometimes they even reach for genuine emotion as our gang tries to right the wrongs of injustice) but the strength of the show lies in witty banter and an easy camaraderie of our crew.  The cases themselves can range from laugh out loud funny to downright preposterous, but no matter how silly things get--the actors engage and sell it!  Gina Bellman as the grifter, Beth Riesgraf as the thief, Christian Kane as the muscle, and Aldis Hodge as the techie all give stellar performances.  They've grown into their roles and expanded beyond the initial stereotypes.  The inner battles and positioning within the team are priceless.  Ostensibly a vehicle for Oscar winning actor Timothy Hutton as the mastermind, he is actually the weakest aspect of the show for me personally.  I love Hutton in general, even thinking of his perfect performance in ""Ordinary People"" makes me a bit emotional.  But haunted by inner demons, he seems at odds with the easy feel of the show.  Also, in the cons, his accents and performances are so over-the-top--it reduces everyone else to moron level to begin to believe he is who he says he is.But, again, the show isn't going for realism--so all is forgivable.  I just never feel he is as deft at the comedic elements required as his compatriots.  Season Three attempts to make things more serious, however, in its second half by reintroducing Damien Moreau as the team's major nemesis.  I don't know, however, if multi-layered plotting or continuing storylines are the series' strong point.  The episodes that stick out for me are some of the outrageous stand alone shows.  My highlight is probably ""The Rashomon Job.""  A rather silly escapade, really, it is highlighted by the guys each sharing their version of what happened--and the way they describe their fellow team members elicited some of the largest laughs of the year!  Then there's Kane as a country superstar and Hodge as a concert violinist--two great bits.  As a comedy, I'd rate this a five star entertainment--but oftentimes the tone gets decidedly sentimental or serious.  ""Leverage"" is much less convincing in these moments, in my opinion.  But bright and breezy rules the day.  If you loved the other seasons, you'll undoubtedly love this one.  If you haven't sample the show yet, why not give it a peek?  KGHarris, 4/11.16 Episodes:  The Jailhouse Job, The Reunion Job, The Inside Job, The Scheherazade Job, The Double Blind Job, The Studio Job, The Gone Fishin' Job, The Boost Job, The Three-Card Monte Job, The Underground Job, The Rashomon Job, The King George Job, The Morning After Job, The Ho Ho Ho Job, The Big Bang Job, and The San Lorenzo Job.",Positive
I agree with other comments about how this video is not good for the family to watch.  Moral values of this film are very poor.I did not even get very far into the movie before seeing way too much sex and nudity. I would not recommend this movie to anyone with moral values.,Negative
"This writing was too formulaic as was the apprehension of the suspect in a cop killing.  Not quite believable, the premise that the suspect ""lived in the neighborhood"" and had a record was never convincingly made.  The family's interactions were tiresome even by the kid's standards who knew the request to eat in the other room away from the adult dining table was coming as family conflict grew.  Young Reagan's partner is far too gorgeous and, we learn in the end, rich.  Blonde, a Porsche, how could any ""Blue Blood"" resist?  Expect a romance in the offing.This was disappointing as a comeback show:  stilted and predictable, a more complex and character-stretching script would have been appreciated.",Negative
"Lots of drama, romance and a great story line.  Too bad they ended after the first season.  Dennis Quaid and Michael Chiklis were awesome in the lead.",Positive

"The reason I like this show ,the 2 people who do the ghost investigations are not trying to put on a show they aren't playing to the camera.

Thats me , my opinion ,plus I'm hoping the miners find gold . :)",Positive
"It's so refreshing to find a truly innovative show that doesn't entail a ton of violence.  This is well acted, well directed and very well written.  I'm so looking forward to Season 4 when it is available for Prime!  Watch it, you will get hooked!",Positive
"This show moves quickly through a 2-day total yard make-over.  While sometimes I wonder why they include so many extreme features, I end up enjoying the end result.  The homeowners assemble a crew to help the professionals so they can complete the job in 2 days.  It's fun to see so many Do It Yourself projects.  Lots of good ideas in this show.",Positive
"""Life Itself"" is a celebration of movies and a man who devoted his life to sharing his insight and passion for moving pictures. It's a movie filled with humor and quite a bit of sadness and bittersweetness. My only complaint is that I wish it were longer and had spent more time on Ebert's interactions with filmmakers, debates with Siskel, interviews conducted by Ebert, etc. It would have been nice to see some footage of the film seminars he conducted in Boulder in which he would analyze a classic film almost frame by frame.The film spends a lot of time on his illness/dying, and while I understand this is important stuff, I found it, mostly for personal reasons, close to unbearable. I've been through some recent family deaths and it was hitting too close to home. I wanted more movies and less tragedy. I did find Ebert's Buddha-like approach to death quite moving.I met Roger Ebert once. It was in New York City during the early 80s shortly after he and Gene Siskel had done a special edition of their show highly critical of slasher flicks in which young people always seem to get horribly killed during or just after sex. I asked him how he, the screenwriter of Russ Meyer's very gory ""Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls,"" could possibly pan a genre of film making that he had been a contributor to. What was the difference between his bloody exploitation flick and the ones he was condemning? His response was short and sweet. ""The difference? Mine was good.""",Positive
The Continuum television show is a great new concept. Her all in one suit is a really neat idea and I would hope that will be in the future of police officers everywhere. And the shot that she gives criminals that will insure that they will go turn themselves in or face unbearable pain is genius.My husband and I both love this new series.,Positive
"The first two seasons of Ancient Aliens, along with The Pyramid Code, were an epiphany to me, and my paradigm for ancient history has been completely rocked.The third season, despite my highest hopes, is at best a rehash of ideas from the first two.  At worst, and for the most part, they push the package so far past believability, that it's almost as if they were set up by Zahi Hawass and the rest of the established liars to make themselves look as if they need to be wearing foil hats.This season is as disappointing as the previous two were ground-breaking.  I don't know how much more information is currently available because Egypt and other governments seem to be hampering further digging and questioning of established theories.I have always taken a dim view of Biblical stories and other basically silly and unfounded ideas preached by religion about the origins of humans.  However, there are gaps and inconsistencies in the more mundane views of human evolution.  When we see parallel civilizations compared, which may have been highly evolved 20,000 years ago, or more...When we think of how the human brain has tripled in size in a few thousand years and when we see no concrete link between Neanderthaloids and modern humans, to the extent that we would be our current species, the questions only begin.The answers just aren't there in history, archeology, paleontology and absolutely, biblically as to why we are the species we are and moreover, why civilizations evolved so dramatically with technologies we can't approach today in such a short time, and why they devolved almost as rapidly in dark ages, which then redeveloped in entirely different directions.I have seen three different UFOs and photographed one I didn't see until I processed the photos.  I know what I saw, and I know these were not the crafts or technologies of humans, although a great black triangle I witnessed flying over the Front Range near Denver in November of 2002, was no doubt the same craft that had become known as the Phoenix Lights, and has been spotted and photographed many times over the years, could be a terrestrial ""Black Op"" of some sort.  It's sheer size mkes me doubt that hypothesis.I have photographed petroglyphs in Sego Canyon and other areas of Utah and the Southwest which represent characters that although resembling humans, resemble figures in protective suits far more, not to mention glyphs showing floating animals people and hovering craft.There are so many inconsistencies in what we are told, and what we can also see with our own eyes denies those lies.There has to be more, and more cogent arguments than are presented in the third season of Ancient Aliens.  If there is a fourth season, I hope they return to building on what was presented in the first two.This season has some merit, and food for thought, but it is not presented with the revolutionary force and logic of the first two.",Negative
"Good guys, bad guys and a little girl who could be used for either.  The good guys do an unbelievably bad job of being good.  The bad guys do an unbelievably bad job of being bad and the little girl is totally confused.  She knows she has some special capabilities but doesn't seem to know why.  OK, she's a little girl, so let that one go for a while.However, both the good guys and the bad guys know that the little girls capabilities could be used as a &#34;weapon&#34;.  Presumably a weapon of mass destruction or something to do with world domination.  Yeah, right, now that's totally believable.From the little bits and pieces thrown in all over the place the following seems to be the story line:  Some rich guy got mixed up in genetic mutation and found he could manipulate people with &#34;special&#34; capabilities.  Some of the people who worked for the rich guy didn't like the direction he was going so they split and became the &#34;good guys&#34;, leaving the rich guy and whoever he had left to be the &#34;bad guys&#34;.  But the plot thickens.  The good guys kidnap (that's a crime) a little girl because they can see that the bad guys are going to use her for no good.  Then they break a convicted criminal out of jail to be the girls &#34;protector&#34;.  And if we believe the sub plot, this crim really is a bad guy.  Even the little girl picks up on it.  The guy looks at her and tears develop.  The girl tells him he's crying because he used to be good once.  That implies that he really is bad now.  But I'm innocent he says. And the &#34;wise&#34; little girl says, that's what everyone in jail claims.  So why have the good guys picked this one particular &#34;bad&#34; guy to be her protector.  Because....wait for it....because he's her father. Wow!!Ok, so it is a very confusing tale (so far at least) but none of that is helped by the twists and turns that simply go unanswered and are all left to our imagination.  Take the female assassin.  Not a very good one as she fails in every attempt.  So she just up and disappears from the scene to be replaced by a male assassin who obviously isn't any better.  Take the scenario at the casino.  The &#34;protector&#34; convinces the girl to use her capabilities to help him win some money (to replace the bag full he left on a fire escape).  So rightly or wrongly, she helps him rip off a craps table to the tune of 30K.  When he notices that the girl is no longer sitting in the eatery, he panics, cashes in his chips and leaves to find the kid.  Now during his sojourn at the craps table, there was a craps table boss.  He had never seen this guy before and so when he ups and leaves, this &#34;table boss&#34; knows nothing about him other than he was a big winner who suddenly cashed in his chips and left.So we break to the &#34;table boss&#34; who sneaks out into the stair well for a quick smoke.  The male assassin follows him out and starts to beat the crap (no pun intended) out of the craps table boss, expecting him to know everything about the big winner, like who he is, where he went and on and on the saga goes, becoming more unbelievable with every word that is spoken and every disjointed scene that is played out.There is one theme in the show (I suspect a story line stolen from another show) where the little girl does something &#34;good&#34; for someone.  In the first episode it was a young doctor who wanted to toss in the towel.  In the second episode it was a young boy who needed really expensive life saving treatment.  If my suspicions are correct, this story line will continue throughout the rest of the series and some where amongst all the confusion that is the show, the girl will find someone to do something good for in each ensuing episode.I find it hard to believe that people like JJ Abrahams and organizations like Bad Robot got involved in something as poorly produced as this.  I just hope they got their money up front, because I don't &#34;believe&#34; it will last.  What a title for a show.  &#34;Believe&#34;.  Unfortunately it is so &#34;unbelievable&#34; that it makes a mockery of the title.",Negative

"This is a little movie that boasts a big ensemble cast, including a surprise cameo performance.  I was happy to see this actor after quite  a while.  The film offers a nice look into a portion of the United States that is of particular interest to me.  One has the opportunity to see and hear the people of Durham, North Carolina. The way in which they regard each other with such respect is well appreciated.I would have liked to give this movie another star.  There are a couple of weaker points in this.  The movie, in itself, is charmingly well-acted and the plot is solid. I just wish they could have further pulled-out the story line by adding some time, or even shortened it, to more robustly develop the plot. For some, the ending may be questionable even a possible let down.Colin Firth arrives in Durham traveling from a small town in Texas.  There, he and his company have developed the town, employed the people and even added recreational properties.  Now in Durham he wishes to do the same by renting Ellen Burstyn's emptied tobacco warehouse.  He wishes to utilize it to store a company's hazardous waste, comes into conflict with the town, Burstyn herself, and her niece Patricia Clarkson.  While the three are personally tackling several conflicts, along with the town itself, there is another side issue occurring.Amber Tamblyn along with Orlando Bloom, who is now one of the city's police officers and going to college to become a lawyer, were once a couple.  She is grasping at straws in an attempt to leave Durham for a fuller life, while Bloom stays living with his mother looking out for her welfare.  Bloom doesn't want to leave the city, intending to work there as an attorney after school.  These two have been close since high school where they were a steady couple and continue their relationship afterwards.  They have since broken it off, although his mother and her parents still are hoping for a reconciliation.The budding relationship between Clarkson and Firth starts prickly then getting plausible, and works, while Colin Firth involves her through the Aunt's interests in the warehouse. It hinges on the decision Burstyn must make, for stretching out the amount of time and money to rent her property to his company.  This involves several opinions and Firth must first go before the local town board.  He requests that Clarkson accompanies him there. At first Patricia Clarkson is stoically nondescript, then begins to soften around the edges, viewing Colin Firth as nonthreatening to her Aunt and to herself.  He is only attempting to find a city that needs help financially to aid his company also.During the entire movie, Burstyn is in a quandary about whether to sell her very old, overly large, and beautifully atmospheric home.  She is quite aged now and has never lived anywhere but here. Since Burstyn was born there, she is now living through her past memories.This movie is so well-acted and the spoken Southern wording is lovely to hear.  There is a real ambiance to this; no swearing, no violence.  Just a sweet story I wish would have gone on to a fuller conclusion to see where all these relationships would complete.  For those who like their films easy going, this one would definitely toe the mark.",Positive
"As a previous reviewer wrote, it is impossible to know who the Good Guys and Who the Bad Guys are in the future, in the present, whatever. Admittedly, I miss some of the talk, fast female speaking is the first to go with age (for women and men), but, after thinking we were supposed to be rooting for the anti-Capitalists who were to be executed for those beliefs (very beginning of first episode), further events muddied the water and, without giving away plot lines, I decided that SuperGirlCop of the Future, now in the present, had to be  on the right side to follow since she is the Star. Happily, I do not look to television for political clarity; hmm, do I look to Washington for Political Clarity? No Comment. I am politically neutral in print (and in practice, too, for that matter).At any rate, there are the Bad Guys from the viewpoint of the star, which is all that matters, and they are out to cause trouble. She is the good guy (or gal if you prefer) out to stop them. They are all back from the future into our own times.After that, it is back to cops and robbers, with the SuperGirlCop still having with her some of  the more advanced devices of the future. For the good of the show, the Bad Guys only brought back their bad thoughts. Then there is guy on  the computer in a Barn somewhere, who for some reason is able to have interchanges with SuperGirlCop, even though she is not in front of a camera. I think he explained it along the way but it made no impression on me.At any rate, there is lots of shooting and blowing things up and people unable to hit a Good Guy target at 7 feet even though shooting at a rate of 100  bullets a minute. If you take the customary attitude of acceptance toward this kind of fantasy, you could have a good time. The female lead is quite good looking and, only guessing, so too is the male lead (for those who care about that). As I have said, the action bursts through in short enough intervals to keep the silly talk to a minimum, and the producers seem to have had sufficient cash in hand to give ithe show a quality veneer.",Positive
"Obviously, as all of the bad reviews indicate, Loss of Life has some problems, but I rather enjoyed it for the most part.  Of course, I&#8217;m a fan of low-budget found footage films in general, which makes me much more tolerant of mistakes and problems that the average moviegoer.  I can understand, though, why some viewers gave up on the film within the first half hour &#8211; not only does nothing really happen, you&#8217;re blasted with a cacophony of voices that make it impossible to hear all &#8211; or even much &#8211; of what is being said (I highly advise turning on closed captioning).  What you have is six young high school guys getting together and acting like &#8211; well, high school guys.  They&#8217;re all talking or yelling at the same time, doing stupid stuff for the camera, etc.  They&#8217;re all excited because it&#8217;s Halloween night and there&#8217;s a big party going down later on.  First, though, they stop off in some alley to do some filming for a &#8220;project.&#8221;  That&#8217;s when the movie finally kicks into gear.Suddenly, this young lady &#8211; beaten and bloody &#8211; runs toward them asking for help, and the next thing you know two dudes in creepy masks are shooting at them.  Rather than get in their SUV and drive away, they panic and run across the alley into a warehouse, thus beginning a deadly game of hide and seek that does feature some creepy moments along the way.  There&#8217;s a problem, though &#8211; these guys basically refuse to get away, even when they can do so rather easily, on numerous occasions.  When you&#8217;re hiding from psychos trying to kill you, there are just some things you don&#8217;t do &#8211; unless you&#8217;re these guys.  When trying to hide and stay hidden, you really shouldn&#8217;t make all kinds of noise bickering amongst yourselves; you shouldn&#8217;t just take some dude&#8217;s word that there&#8217;s no cell phone reception in the area (especially when you&#8217;re obviously in a decent-sized city); when given the car keys and told to go get help, you shouldn&#8217;t just sit in the car, argue for ten minutes, and then follow the bad guys back inside when safety is literally only a few dozen feet away.  Cowering inside the car with the bad guys just feet away, one of these guys actually turns on the camera light.The camerawork is actually quite good for a film of this type, combining clear footage from cell phones, a video camera, and security cameras.  I have no problem with the acting, either &#8211; the guys are certainly convincing as goofball teenagers, and they do convey plenty of fear once the bad guys show up.  The gore, while not excessive, is convincing enough, as well.  Unfortunately, the movie just can&#8217;t overcome the fact that these guys make incredibly stupid decisions &#8211; or that the first half hour is seemingly designed to turn casual viewers away.  All of the one-star reviews are perfectly understandable, but I personally still managed to enjoy the movie overall.  For me, there were some moments that were quite effective, and I did care about what happened to several of the characters.  And even though the plot is pretty formulaic, the movie doesn&#8217;t end quite the way you might expect it to.  If and only if you&#8217;re a fan of found footage horror, Loss of Life isn&#8217;t a total loss.",Negative
"Post Apocalyptic.Aliens?Survival.Humanity, Pros and Cons.Some Biblical talk.Supernatural?This could break either way. It could go a more intellect oriented path, or devolve into an emotional supernatural drama, anything goes, and less science fiction way.

But like I said, it could be good.It kept my interest all of the way through and left off with a nice &#34;what next&#34; ending.",Positive

"Rewind This! is a perfect documentary; an amazing blend of historical information and personal passion, with a set of well-chosen clips that will entice newcomers and enthrall the experienced. That's really the strength of the documentary, the way it imparts all its information without feeling either too boring or too scattered. The film opens on a shot-on-VHS trip to go VHS hunting in Texas, and from there we move on to the VHS/Beta wars, the different kinds of covers, and the recent resurgence in the format. The talking heads are all interesting, and many of them are interviewed along with their collections or in other non-standard locations. Many names will be familiar to those who grew up on VHS&#8212;Frank Henenlotter, Charles Band, Lloyd Kaufman&#8212;and though many will not, the unknown enthusiasts convey their knowledge and passion effectively.Then, of course, there are the clips. Some of them will be familiar to many viewers. Of course, Jane Fonda helped sell VHS with her famous exercise video. Some, however, are pretty obscure. Before watching Rewind This!, I didn't know that Bubba Smith released his own workout video, and the excerpts seen here are pretty convincing. We also see parts of an independent shot-on-VHS Western, a ninja flick from the late eighties, and more obvious choices like Frankenhooker. There's a good mix of the obscure and the well-known, so VHS-lovers and those born after the format's demise will be satisfied.The DVD itself is great. The 1.78:1 anamorphic transfer is solid&#8212;contemporary material is clean and bright, and all the glorious artifacts of VHS are there when the film turns to clips. The film isn't really a visual feast, but the presentation is watchable and serves the material well. The Dolby 5.1 Surround audio is similarly good for the film. The talking heads are all perfectly audible, and the mix with the clips is well done.Perhaps ironically for a DVD about VHS culture, this set has a good amount of extras. Things kick off with a commentary by director Josh Johnson, producer Carolee Mitchell, and DP/editor Christopher Palmer that reveals a lot of the stories behind securing interviews and their enthusiasm for the project. The bulk of the extras, though, is the hour or so of additional interview footage. Cut just like the feature, these are segments that didn't make the movie, from pieces on remix culture to video panic. They're as interesting as some of the stuff that made the cut. There's also some bonus animation and a music video.Gordon Sullivan, VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",Positive

"Deadfall was a film that I thought I might enjoy but instead fell in love with.The ensemble cast is the main attraction along with the acting and chemistry between all of the main characters plus it is beautifully shot and thought out.it has it all. Love,action, blood,tested loyalties and much more.I will be buying this because I will most certainly watch it again and again.There are so many moments that resonated joy and pain for me ,it humanizes the villain played to perfection by Eric Bana by showing that he has a heart when he wants to but on the other hand is sociopathic if anyone gets in the way of what he needs at the moment.Charlie Hunnam is amazing as the ex con who also won a silver medal in Boxing at the Beijing Olympics. He and Olivia Wilde have hot chemistry together and this is part of why the film works so well.The love scenes are tastefully done but really hot.There are several relationships such as Father /Daughter.Father/Son.Brother/Sister and a Man and a Woman being explored during the film and some irony  that goes along with it at the end.I can't say enough good things about this film except in closing I would mention Sissy Spacek who is always a wonderful Academy Award winning actress.",Positive

Finished watching Covert Affairs season 3 and had a good time watching this with family. This season keeps you on the edge for some nice action packed drama. The main character is obviously Annie Walker portrayed by Piper Perabo who surprisingly has done some excellent acting. All the other characters has done excellent acting too making this whole season worth watching. Good story-line & never a dull moment.

"- Korra, seriously sleepy and railing against her morning regimen: ""What's the big idea with making me train this early in the morning?"" (voice drops to a whisper) ""The morning is eeeeevil.""So I'm not that familiar with the original cartoon show. When you mention AVATAR I think of giant blue aliens. And, to me, airbending is what you do when you've had too many spicy chimichangas. Except that I saw THE LEGEND OF KORRA on Nickelodeon and was impressed enough that I'm now incentivized to touch base with the source material.AVATAR:THE LAST AIRBENDER was oriented towards a wandering heroes theme, something which THE LEGEND OF KORRA eschews. Our protagonist has it over Avatar Aang by some years, and so I understand that, in comparison, the storytelling is darker and more ambitious. Some seventy years after Avatar Aang's turbulent era, here's Korra, an impulsive teenager, being projected as the next Avatar, except that Korra can only bend three of the four elements. Seeking mastery over that elusive fourth element, determined to learn airbending, she leaves her training outpost in the South Pole and journeys to Republic City to train under the stern airbending master, Tenzin, who happens to be Avatar Aang's youngest child, now grown to middle-age adulthood. Korra brings along her wicked awesome polar bear dog, Naga, who is so awesome I'm compelled to use the word ""awesome"" three times in a sentence.In Republic City Korra is initially regarded as a rube, a rustic, but she's adventurous and high-spirited and so confident. As her frustration at her inability to airbend grows, her notoriety as the Avatar exposes her to public scrutiny and to the twisty politics of Republic City. She becomes aware of the increasing anti-bending sentiment harbored by the non-bending populace. She finds solace in competing in the hotly contested pro-bending sports league. Imagine the hubbub when it's outed that the current incarnation of the Avatar is one-third of the Fire Ferrets. They've just qualified for the playoffs.Meanwhile, looming over everything is the malevolent presence of Amon, the shadowy figure that leads the anti-bending movement calling itself the Equalists. A non-bender (and proud of it), Amon uses his ability to strip away others' bending skills to inspire the Equalists and to foment a violent revolution. He wants to reshape the world. He sets his eyes on Korra. He's a fantastic villain, even if the show does play dirty pool with regards to his true identity.""Book One: Air"" presents this series' marvelous first twelve episodes. Week after week, these episodes keep on topping each other. I couldn't believe how good it was. I dig the backdrop, Eastern mysticism hand in hand with western innovation, a rich blend of the medieval and the progressive. Seventy years had elapsed from Aang's own series, enough time for the way of life to evolve from feudalism to something resembling industrial Shanghai circa 1920s. I love those touches, the vintage automobiles, that voice on the radio that just reminds you of the flapper era. The animation is so visually striking and gets only more dynamic when Korra and her friends spring into action. And, yes, Korra makes friends and, in fact, goes on to form an informal posse that engages in bouts of vigilante justice throughout Republic City.The action sequences are so boss and made even more epic by the presence of metal benders and blood benders and sinister chi-blockers, as well as the more traditional benders. I love that Korra fights with reckless abandon. I really like her character's arc, her growth as a person. I also became fond of Tenzin, Bo Lin, Asami Sato and the stoic Police Chief Lin Beifong. Seeing Beifong and Tenzin unleashed planted a big grin on my mug. That grin only got wider when Tenzin's adorable little kids get in on the act (that young boy is a riot).Did I even mention how funny this show is?Even if there were no more LEGEND OF KORRA episodes after this, I'm satisfied. This is an arc rich in plot development. It's constructed with a definite beginning, middle, and end in mind, and I can't recommend it enough. If there are any naysayers, it's those who demand even stronger ties between THE LEGEND OF KORRA and its predecessor, never mind that Easter eggs pepper the episodes. It's a good thing I don't have blood-bending talents. However, I'm down with those who say that the narrative could do without the cheesy teen romance bits. Mako kind of ticks me off. I can't wait for the next season, or is it the second half of Season One?The DVD set comes with 2 discs. The bonus stuff goes like so:- ""The Legend of Puppetbender Presents: The Making of a Legend: The Untold Story, Part I"" - spoofy interviews with a fake LEGEND OF KORRA cast... as puppets (00:06:00 minutes)- Audio Commentary by Creators, Cast & Crew on 4 episodes: ""Welcome to Republic City"" (with creators/exec. producers Mike Dimartino and Bryan Konietzko and Janet Varney who voices ""Korra""), ""A Leaf in the Wind"" (Dimartino, Konietzko, Janet Varney and David Faustino who voices ""Mako""), ""Skeletons in the Closet (Dimartino, Konietzko, and composers/sound designers Ben Wynn and Jeremy Zuckerman), and ""Endgame"" (Dimartino, Konietzko, co-exec. producer Joaquim Dos Santos and Steve Blum who voices ""Amon"")",Positive

Could there be some connection between Psy-Max and this murderous monster? BRAINIAC is a low-budget remake, loosely based on the original cheeeze-fiesta from Mexico. This version is every bit as ridiculous as the original. Having set the bar rather low for BRAINIAC, I was not disappointed. I especially enjoyed the tough, ""street"" lingo used by the biker dude and the drug dealer! Priceless! Just wait until you see the BRAINIAC him / itself! What a hoot!...",Negative
"I'm crazy about the movies and could talk about different aspects of the film world for hours upon hours. So any serious contemplation about the art of filmmaking has an inherent interest for me. But beyond that, ""Side by Side"" assembles some of the biggest names imaginable to discuss the digital revolution currently underway. Producer and host Keanu Reeves interviews such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Steven Soderbergh, David Lynch, David Fincher, and James Cameron for this piece. And while these are some of the biggest names (those featured prominently on the DVD/Blu-ray cover), there are plenty of other familiar faces willing to weigh in as well. With lessons in film history and film technology, the documentary is also a stunning retrospective of movies that will have you yearning to revisit many of your favorites (often with a new eye). Seriously, you should get a film school credit for watching this presentation! This is no dry lecture, however, but more like a lively and informal debate.Celluloid has been the exclusive medium for movies for over a hundred years. Recently, though, advances in digital technology have changed the game. ""Side by Side"" charts the evolution of the technology using lots of examples and film clips to highlight the historical stages of digital filmmaking. Once the province of low budget student films or experimental works, it now accounts for a large portion of the entertainment shown in modern movie theaters. Does this trend mean the end of film as we know it? This is the big question at the heart of ""Side by Side."" Some proclaim the texture of film can not be rivaled, others embrace the new possibilities of digital, and many fall into the middle of the debate. One thing seems fairly certain, though, there is no escaping this brave new world.Chris Kenneally packs a lot of information into ""Side by Side"" and Reeves is a genial host (bonus points for charting the different stages of his facial hair throughout). What makes the movie so enjoyable is that those who contribute to the discussion obviously love what they are doing. It's almost infectious. Anyone who loves the movies should not miss this one! Rarely do you get a chance to sit down with so much talent and have them wax on about the history of film. And again, the presentation is so loaded with movie clips that my brain went into overdrive compiling a list of classics that I needed to watch again. In the end, ""Side by Side"" adequately addresses its central theme. But unexpectedly, it's about much broader topics as well and has a real universal appeal. Informative and entertaining, this is an essential piece about modern movie making! KGHarris, 10/13.",Positive
"The first half of this movie you're left wondering why RW is such a whimp.If I had a kid like that, I would smack the **** out of him so others wouldn't have to put up with him.Fortunately, that didn't happen.After all the negativity that RW had to put up with, he takes a frown & turns it upside down.The movie centers around sex, & there are some very awkward scenes that are hilarious.If you need a good laugh, this is it.You end up knowing more about what's going on than the people in the movie.RW was the World's Greatest Dad for putting up with his kid, then taking care of business.You'll know the scene when you watch it.",Positive
"The Bay, directed by Barry Levinson, is a ""found-footage"" psychological-horror film surrounding an event that took Chesapeake Bay by surprise, and by terror. When residents of the small Maryland town on Chesapeake Bay are infected by an unknown plague, panic and chaos set in. Told through the narration of a rookie newscaster, the story splits off into multiple characters as they deal with the situation, following two researchers weeks before the event, and even a family who arrives at the bay after the infection hit hours earlier.While I think the ""found-footage"" sub-genre is rapidly dying and becoming more annoying than interesting, The Bay is a much more thoughtful addition to the genre. The acting, while was not award-winning or phenomenal, was still good and believable. Levinson's directing was superb, not completely over the place but instead carefully shot and edited. The visuals, with what little there was, were perfect; the Isopods were not cheesy but very creepy and realistic. The cinematography was surprisingly great, too, for a ""found-footage"" film. The musical score by Marcelo Zarvos was good and worked very well in the film, helping shape the eerie atmosphere and terror of how quickly the situation got out of hand.Overall, The Bay is a refreshing thriller that shows us what happens when we screw with Mother Nature. Now, some will try to compare it to M. Night's The Happening, because the plot lines are similar, but The Happening was not as well-written or directed. Think of The Bay as Contagion on a smaller scale and ""found-footage."" This movie, though, is not for everyone, as it is very violent and disturbing.4/5 Stars****",Positive
"The narrative captures the creative essence which, upon viewing, can accurately be said to have fueled the entire music boom from the early '60's to the '80's. Name an artist. Elton John, Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Allman Brothers, Lynrd Skynrd, Bobbie Jo Gentry, Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon, Wilson Pickett.. the list extends very far. They all recorded at Muscle Shoals and took advantage of the dedicated, craft oriented session players, many of whom were white, middle class boys out of high school, to play on their records. Yet their sound intimated an ethnic orientation beyond the color of their skin. The main figure, Rick Hall, calls it the &#34;human element,&#34; a relentless dedication to perfection. An unswerving dedication to craft. It shows through in this movie. American draftsmanship.",Positive
This was kind of sad as some old maids were stuck on old customs and unreasonable principles.  Thankfully it ended on a positive note.,Negative
This is another show with an original pairing of male and female detectives.  Has good character development.  Good follow through on old unsolved cases as well.  Holmes and Watson were well chosen and have just a little chemistry thrown in.  Highly Recommended!,Positive
"Adventure Time!  As usual, great work.  Wacky and entertaining so fun for many ages.  Some darker themes and jokes are included.",Positive
"This movie is in Spanish only and this director & his producer need to be boycotted on any movie they make. False advertising. They have the DVD cover and title in English... but to watch the movie, you either have to read subtitles or closed captioning. It is a sham to use false advertising to sell  to unsuspecting shoppers. They did the same thing with Pans Labrynth.It also would not have been a huge imposition on the director and producer to provide an Alternate English audio option like we do on our English speaking movies. This is the second and last time this director will ever sell any movies to me. I will never buy another of his movies even if every movie he makes from this point on is in English... because he's used up any trust we may have had. So when his career goes in the dumper in the US... don't blame the economy. Blame yourself for deceptive advertising and printing the DVD cover in English. If the cover and title had been in Spanish to begin with, we wouldn't be so irate because we would not have bought it in the first place. I have thousands of movies in my collection but this will be the last time this director ever darkens my viewing.I have nothing against Spanish. In fact I lived in Panama for 2 years.. but I don't want my movies in Spanish and I certainly don't appreciate the deliberately deceptive False English DVD cover and Title to make us think the movie is in English.If any of our US producers or Directors put a Spanish label and Spanish Title on a DVD cover and tried to pass it off to the Spanish speaking countries ... and then only had the movie in English or French... I suspect their consumers would be very angry as well.They wouldn't like it anymore than the Germans would want to watch a movie in Arabic or Chinese.Amazon is also responsible for this deception by allowing it to be marketed in English. If a movie is in Spanish, then the Title should also be in Spanish. And since this is an English website... it should have a huge warning at the top of the page telling English speaking shoppers that this movie is in Spanish only!And as an added note: This director does cheesy, immature camera effects. Near the end, he just goes nuts with his 360 camera rotating around the main character... it seemed like 5 minutes of nothing but spinning. It got so monotonous I had to fast forward just to get away from it. This is something a 16 year old would do shooting a movie in his garage for a school project.And let's not forget that the kid with the sack over his head was a cheap takeoff on Jason from the ""Friday the 13th"" movie series.Avoid this director and producer like the plague!!!",Negative
I really enjoy this show.  Hannibal is awesome and Hugh Dancey is gorgeous! I would love for him to have a show of his own!,Positive
"This pilot was kinda slow at the start but most pilots usually are,  but by half way I was entertained!  They they made an apocalypse show into some sort of extra terrestrial show, and not even a believable one at that!",Negative
Hey america this is the dumbing down you demand. This show is complete trash. Just glorifies murder and cannibalism. Its not clever or unique and it is repulsive you will love it.,Negative
"The series plotlines are very interesting and well done. The acting is at best mediocore. Why homicide detectives roam the underworld of murder without weapons is pretty lame and why do all these British mystery series need a &#34;doubting Thomas&#34; sidekick/superior that get in the way of the investigations and need to criticize the lead detective?  The ending to season 1 was quite disappointing. It was like they didn't know how to complete the story so they just  .....SPOILER ALERT ....  had the unsub commit suicide. DUMB !!! some reason to  Give the audience someone to root for. I understand &#34;good&#34; doesn't always prevail, but give us hope.The lead character is not at all interesting and even their attempt to make him OCD falls flat. He bumbles his way through each investigation and doesn't make you care about him one or the other. I give this series 2 and 1/2 stars.",Negative
"Season 7 is the last and perhaps best of the Morse series. Afterwards there were several specials filmed over the years but I have yet to find them to view.  Let's face it, any TV series which co-stars a 1960 Mark 2 Jag has got to be one-of-a-kind.",Positive
"Mr. Tim Roth drives this story line although Kellie Martin is probably meant to be a co star. The think I like most is that this is a intelligent TV series because you learn about people in our society who lie, and to some extent learn about reading people with whom you deal.  I first saw Roth in a Scottish film with Liam Neeson called where he held his own which is no easy task. The rest of the cast is alright but it is Roth who carries the film with his strutting and insights.",Positive
"The movie starts out with a movie projectionist reading about the lost colony of Roanoke. Then the power goes off. When he investigates he finds empty clothes where people should be. There are eerie shadows and he too disappears. Hayden Christensen wakes up and finds the city in a similar state, with clothes, but missing bodies. 3 days later (apparently he was unable to walk out of the city in that time, Christensen is walking around the city in the dark scrounging batteries for flashlights (HEY! TRY THE STORES!) and discovering the city has been hit by a discriminating EMF that effects car batteries but not dry cells. He is not yet ready to embrace the dark side of the force.In the midst of it all he finds a bar with the lights still on (own generator) and decides he needs a bracer. People start to congregate at the bar one at a time. Outside, when your light goes out, computer generated blackness quickly swarms around you to eerie music. Sunlight becomes a thing of the past as Detroit becomes Dark City. Apparently these are not the people who know how to set the city on fire every Halloween.The characters discuss tons of reasons why this is happening and the best one was that God/ the universe hit the ""reset"" button and they are the stragglers.",Negative
"Having been a huge fan of the original Primeval series, I can't help but be disappointed by this pallid sequel. I will stop short of saying it's bad, but it certainly isn't good. ""Uninteresting"" is an apt word. A few good casting choices, more bad ones. The dialogue drags terribly: a conversation that should be dispatched in five energetic sentences goes on for three minutes while the viewer loses interest and forgets what the characters were discussing in the first place. Cinematography - what's that? I count four angles, all predictable, with the favorite being neck-up close shots of faces the director obviously thinks (erroneously) are gorgeous enough that the viewer will forgive bad acting and humdrum dialogue just to stare at starry eyes, lip gloss, and five o'clock shadow. The worst fault is direction, which makes adequate and sometimes really gifted actors appear wooden, two-dimensional, and boring. Actors come and go with no more motivation, apparently, than showing off some well-modeled biceps or a perky derriere. Even the dinosaurs - who provide the raison d'etre for the whole series, right? - seem like flashes of action diverting attention from what the director obviously thinks is the main point of the story: post-adolescent social interaction. I don't think I can stand another season of this ennui. Maybe if the producers wise up and hire directors who can really - direct. . .",Negative
"Just, how screwed up can one family be?  This documentary seems to portray a fictional family, that is routinely involved with every degrading, unscrupulous, vindictive, vile, inhumane and disgusting trait that anyone can possess - but it's real!  You can't call this extended family &#34;the other half&#34; because &#34;the other half&#34; could never conceive of a lifestyle that barely hangs onto the threads of our collective humanity.  The Whites are, however, such an interesting and unusual mix that I was entertained, beyond belief.  I'm not particularly a Johnny Knoxville (Jackass Movies) fan but this documentary certainly kept my attention.",Positive
I love &#34;The Mentalist&#34;.It is a well written show and the acting is NOT over the top-- you know how some shows seem to be trying to be &#34;cool&#34; or &#34;scary&#34; or really &#34;with it?&#34; That is getting old in my opinion.Not so with Patrick Jane and agent Lisbon- You can start watching this series anytime and really enjoy it. It has a smooth feel and does not attempt to confuse you or make you guess. It is just a well written and acted series.Thumbs UP!!,Positive
"I love seeing the zombies in varying states of ... umami but this show has really dragged for me and I really hate the commercial breaks BUT ever since the Season 2 finale, this has been a different show.  Having read the wikipedia on the comic, I dreaded Season 3 and while I hated the Andrea parts (unlike her conduct in the Season 2 finale), this season delivered so many more scenes that were just treats compared to the previous two seasons.I would definitely buy this season for the maximum price of $25.  I think it would be awesome to be able to sit through a commercial free marathon but if it is never priced right, I will just watch via netflix.I would never recommend Season 1 and 2 but this season was better than decent.  I noticed that Carol was practicing a la  Mengele when preparing for Lori giving birth but I never learned that this show is named after the musselman of concentration camps until I readMoni: A Novel of Auschwitz.  Unfortunately, that means that this  incredibly entertaining show is the delivery system for what the musselmen were living in the midst of i.e. the destruction and decay of murdered fellow inmates some missing body parts because of the starving prisoners delayed their own executions unlike the cannibalism for unity practiced by the Japanese army on Chinese citizens as well as Allied prisoners of war quarterway around the world at the same time.",Positive
"finish a story, and do it well, very rarely. This show did that, and with style, it should be considered the standard.",Positive
"I can't say this was anything on the brilliant side of writing but the characters, the settings and the dialogue sure keep you watching. The stories are good and wrap up mostly by the end of each episode with a few lines to keep weaving through. Dennis Quaid is spooky as the sheriff - scary grin and all. Good guys vs bad guys always make for a good show, and the lovely cars and airplanes of that era are sure worth added value. I remember when women really dressed up like that... nice series.",Positive

"I love to watch this show with my girls. The recipes shown are classic comfort foods, done in a fun and relaxed environment! I love this show so much I look forward to the next season!",Positive
"Okay, many reviews are stating this was horrible.  I disagree.  If the movies &#34;Blair Witch Project,&#34; &#34;Texas Chainsaw Massacre,&#34; and &#34;The Hills Have Eyes&#34; were combined, they would produce this movie.  You have the shaky filming, faux-documentary style filming, similar to &#34;Blair Witch.&#34;  You have weird, hermit/hillbilly/backwoods killers, torturing people for unknown reasons, comparable to &#34;The Hills Have Eyes&#34; (although in fairness, the cannibals in the &#34;Hills&#34; movies ate their victims; no proof of cannibalism in this movie, just parts of bodies stripped of flesh, tossed into the woods.  I mean, if they were cannibals, would they toss away that much meat?)  Finally, you have some gore, complete with a fat man in an apron - and possibly a mask? Unsure of that due to the filming - similar to &#34;Texas Chainsaw.&#34;  Add to that, although I fully expected the type of ending this movie had, it still made me jump a tad bit in my seat, and that is a rare thing for a movie to do to me.  The acting was more than acceptable, storyline was loose - but there.  No questions were really answered, but it was still a satisfying flick.",Positive
My family and I enjoy watching {and laughing} Duck Dynasty!! Great morals!,Positive
"I watchedV/H/Sdutifully, as a genre fan. Interesting concept. Heavy on the fetishes, light on interesting ideas. So I wasn't prepared for the occasional full-on BRILLIANCE of VHS2. The thing to remember is, you have to take these vignettes for what they are supposed to be--collected found footage of horrifying scenarios. If you view this anthology as a traditional horror movie, you will of course be disappointed. This is more like being in a fist-person videogame with no control over the action. It is unsettling, unnerving, and often enough, downright terrifying. Yes, it's gory. Possibly excessively gory--although I was in awe of how they got some of those shots, like the exploding guy. The wraparound story was relatively weak, but it ended fairly strong. For genre fans, 2 is much more of a must-see than the original was. And I hope they make enough money from this one to make another, even stronger entry.By the way, if you already saw and enjoyed this movie, you might likeThe Bay [HD]. It takes first-person, found-footage storytelling to the most artful lengths I've seen employed so far.",Positive
"I liked the story line this season, i feel like it lived up to its promise. Last season was a little wonky, too many whiplash moments. the sneaky touch of patton oswald was a delightful surprise, and the the actor who played the county sherriff is always a delight to watch. It is fun to see so many Deadwood players parading thru this show, and sons of anarchy. the result is lots of quality acting. I like that they brought Rachael to the front a bit more, and the sniper (sorry, drawing a blank on names this moment). His storyline is fascinating. Keep it up folks!!",Positive

Claymation is wonderful and this is better than a cartoon.  All Shaun the Sheeps are well done with great stories for the PG crowd!,Positive
"It makes statements about the world we live in how we are taught to believe in certain things, to obey authority, get things correct, do what we are told in the workplace, with no worry of the end result/ consequences especially in government type jobs.  How we don't get to chose to be born or where we are born, but we are shaped by that environment.  I thought it was pretty interesting.",Positive
"I am a fan of other crime dramas e.g. Castle, Bones, etc.  I also am a fan of Sherlock Holmes. I love the modern take on Sherlock Holmes. I will admit that reading the stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, I can get a little lost in the references of modes of transportation and techniques that are over a hundred years old. This show helps to bridge that gap, so we are working with cell phones and cars, which is something I can relate to.The acting is great. I love that they chose Lucy Liu for the part of Watson.The story telling is good. The stories are good.I also appreciate the show is relatively clean. The themes can be adult but they don't seem to be trying to push the the envelope with the content.",Positive

"Plunge into the dark, gritty, wet world of the northwest with this murder mystery that never lets up. Certainly this is a plot driven story, one about a girl who goes missing and is found dead. Mix in some political intrigue, family drama, and some wicked cop tension. Now you have a great setup. Use great direction and sound design, you take it up another notch. Keep the pacing going without losing your breath and you're almost there. Finally, great acting of finely tuned characters and you have a great show, which this one is. What I like most is the seriousness of the drama. A murder isn't treated as some abstract thing. It's real for everyone involved: family, cops, and so on. The effects are devastating and far reaching, as they should be. You won't find very many &#34;pretty&#34; people in this show like those handsome and beautiful actors who portray cops and perpetrators in other venues. This one gets down and dirty. So real, you'll be soaking wet by the time it's over.",Positive
I saw a couple episodes when it aired live and wanted to see the whole series.  Really like the show!,Positive
I can't believe I'm saying this but MTV has a winner in awkward. It's genuinely funny and has some pretty great characters. Some of the love plot lines are ridiculous but the characters keep growing on you. Good for a mindless weekend watch.,Positive
This is a really good show. This crime drama real pulls you in. You don't know what flynn and provrnza ail do. They are hilarious.  I like raydor she brings maturity and charm.,Positive
"I was a on the fence with this one when it first came out, but the show keeps getting better and better. I'm glad that Cat gets to be a bit more fierce and a lot less whiney. She can really play that whine card. The cast of characters is awesome. And of course, I love Vincent's character. I'm still not too fond of the graphics on his face when he beasts out. But...they'll figure it out eventually.",Positive
"There will always be great TV shows that get cancelled before their time. But the cancellation of Life was especially painful. The first season, like many other series, suffered from the writers strike, and only 11 of 22 episodes were made. This didn't stop the creators from producing a quality product, but the reduction in episodes made the tail end of that season feel rushed. The second season has 21 episodes, and they make the most of them.Life succeeds where many shows fail in that the show is able to focus on the main characters lives while still delivering interesting storylines that play off said characters quirks. Some shows feature characters with great chemistry, but the creators seem to think that chemistry is enough to hold a show together. Storylines will often take a back seat to the minutia of the lead characters, and hurt the show.In Life the characters personal problems are intergrated into the storyline making them feel organic, and much more enjoyable to watch. The cases they go on are never normal, but they never cross over into being wacky. The criminals are never your cookie cutter bad guys, but instead individuals with their own unique motivations that make them far more dangerous, and alot more fun to watch.Damian Lewis gives an incredible performance giving his character a wide array of emotions that never feel forced. Sarah Shahi is wonderfully grounded when standing next to Lewis and acts as a friend and not just the straight man that has become standard fare, though she does that very well. The new captain, played to great effect by Donal Logue,  complements the cast perfectly and never feels lile his character was forced on us. When Sarah was with child, Gabrielle Union stepped in and delivered a performance that did not try to copy Sarah's, but made the character her own.This is a phenomenal show that was cancelled long before it's time, and you will be doing yourself a disservice if you do not see it.",Positive
"Ok, here's the thing with this show..everyone in it is excellent..I meaneveryone..the story line is fine and the writing good for the set up.I love the parents and always have but the show falls short of evergetting in the least little bit close to what it could be..I don't know whyit's a disappointment but it is..it's got all this gold and for some reasonit's been cast in lead.  Bummer man, because I would really like to watchthese people..and believe me I have tried more than once.",Negative
I can't stop watching this show - it is so dramatic but in a real way.  It is heartbreaking but often redeeming as well.,Positive

I'm not big on spending a lot of time on fiction.  BUT...The wife LOVES drama.  Add a dystopian view to it and she adores it.  This was right up her alley and she would watch another three seasons had they made them.,Positive
"At first I thought it was sacrilegious to create a show inspired by one of the greatest American films of all time.  There was no way I was going to give this show a chance since I figured it couldn't possibly be any good when compared to the film.  But then I saw the trailers and I was intrigued; I had to give it a try at least.  I am so glad I did!  The writing is superb; the acting is phenomenal.  Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton are absolutely stellar.  I don't know how the creator did it; he's managed to stay true to the essence of the film while at the same time, giving the show its own unique voice and style.  My one and only complaint is that it's not filmed in Minnesota.  I miss seeing all the true MN landmarks that were such a great part of the film.  But, that's a small price to pay for watching such an engrossing story and such fantastic acting.  If you haven't started watching yet, park yourself in your comfy chair and hit play.  You'll be glad you did!",Positive
"This show is so good that you CANNOT wait to watch the next episode. The acting and writing are superb. Although the lead characters acting is excellent, I think that Rich Hoffman steals the show.",Positive
"This was purchased for one of my daughter-in-laws as a Christmas present.  She really likes the America's Test Kitchen show, but now has a job where TV time is extremely limited.  This allows her to see the shows when she has the time.  Amazon has a great price for this item as well.",Positive
"The month of October in 2002 was an understandably difficult time for the residents of Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia - not to mention the United States as a whole.  For those that don't recall, this was the time when John Allen Muhammad and his apparent patsy, Lee Boyd Malvo, went on a killing spree in what is now referred to as the ""Beltway snapper attacks.""  Over a three week span, ten people were murdered, while three more were injured as innocent people were struck down by sniper bullets, seemingly without pattern or motive.  Initially, these attacks were thought to have been carried out by assailants using a white van, but it was eventually uncovered that Malvo and Muhammad were using the now infamous blue Chevy Caprice.  The new film, Blue Caprice, attempts to chronicle the psychological driving force behind the killings.Alexandre Moors makes his feature length directorial debut with Blue Caprice, starring Isaiah Washington as John Allen Muhammad and Tequan Richmond as the young Lee Boyd Malvo.  After being abandoned by his mother, the impressionable Malvo meets Muhammad while Muhammad is vacationing with his kids in the Caribbean.  Flash forward several months - Muhammad leads Malvo to the United States, acting as his father figure.  Fueled by anger after his wife takes his children from him, Muhammad plots against the ""system"" by forcing (or encouraging) Malvo to maniacally act on his behalf. The pair travels the United States in a blue Caprice, carrying out random murders, thrusting the country into a state of fear and disarray.  Joey Lauren Adams and Tim Blake Nelson also star in supporting roles.To be certain, Blue Caprice is a chilling, uncomfortable film that chronicles a cryptic series of events.  In all honesty, this is one of those films that doesn't sit well and is more bothersome to witness than anything else.  It almost feels like true stories of this nature should never be used as a means of ""entertainment.""  Films, like Summer of Sam and Zodiac, contain admirable filmmaking contributions, yet they always create an undeniable sense of tenseness during the viewing process.  It's not like the Caprice killings took place 20 years ago.  They are only 11 years old (taking place just a year and change after 9/11), and even more bothersome is the fact that senseless acts of killing have become a norm in the United States, especially with tragic events like the Washington Navy yard, Sandy Hook Elementary, and Aurora movie theater shootings, all looming large.  Will those events turn into movies one day, too?  We should all shudder to think.  For recent tragedies to be depicted on film so soon after the actual events is unnerving, mostly because it appears as though others are cashing in on the events.  It just feels wrong.Aside from the slight objection of this film's subject matter, Blue Caprice features two masterfully acted performances by both Isaiah Washington and Tequan Richmond.  It's not very often that the main cast members of a film are both alarmingly bothersome and absolutely perfect for their roles all at the same time.  Washington leads the way as the cold, calculating manipulator with serious anger and acceptance issues.  He channels his rage to his ""adoptive"" son, portrayed by Richmond - a role that requires very little dialogue, as Richmond does his talking with his eyes and actions.  While Washington and Richmond steal the show, Joey Lauren Adams and Time Blake Nelson are also vital additions to this film, both leaving their fingerprints on their own respective characters - portraying the welcoming friends of the murders.For his first outing, it's brutally apparent that director (and screen writer) Alexandre Moors has a great deal of potential for future projects.  He's nothing short of superb, easily putting to rest any sort of speculation that he might have a subpar first endeavor.  He comes across with a clear vision for the film's characters, focusing on the emotional motivations as opposed to worrying about sticking to a typical historical rundown of events.  He doesn't spend too much time on one specific scene, and quickly gets the point of the scenes across without delay or over-extension.  As the film winds down, Moors uses a gripping and mind-bending montage of the random killings as opposed to spending an excessive amount of time on one incident over the other.  With such an impressive directorial debut, it's impossible not to look forward to his next picture.Overall, Blue Caprice is a film with a difficult subject matter.  At the same time, it's a film with far too many good things going for it to let a beef about the story hold it down.  On the other hand, this is not a typical date night flick, nor is it a film for the casual moviegoer.  This is a film depicting a trying subject matter, portrayed in a masterful, all be it chilling manner.  This low-budget, under-the-radar film will likely go down as more of a critical delight, as opposed to something the masses would enjoy.  There's really no recommendation to be had here unless you're a lover of slow developing, high reward films with no-name actors that will never fully receive the accolades they deserve.GRADE:  B+FNDNreview.com",Positive
It was a great a show on TV. Was nice to be able to see the episodes I missed. Should have kept this series going longer.,Positive
"i have enjoyed it very much and I am looking forward to more seasons of Arrow, please continue adding more scene of this series I can't wait to buy them.",Positive
Some overly dramatic situations and often unbelievable. Like the transformations but difficult to believe some people that stupid. Still has some entertainment value.,Negative

"This started out as an amazing, wonderful show and seems to have devolved down into soap opera.  The mysteries are solved off-screen and explained, rather than seeded throughout the story.",Negative
"This was absolutely my favorite episode of Glee yet.  I especially liked Corey Monteith's version of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, but everyone was in top form.  Several versions brought a tear to my eye.  Santana is an absolute star in this episode.  And Coach Beist can sing, which is the biggest surprise of all.",Positive

"First, decide which media device you want to watch these episodes on.  If you want to watch them on your computer, you get the view-on-demand option that lets you watch on your computer -- but not your TV of course (unless you can run a cable from your computer to your TV) -- or you can get the ""burn on demand"" option here that lets you watch on your consumer electronic DVD player but NOT on your computer.  Seems like a scheme the gophers would come up with.My kids love this show, and do their ""screen time"" on the computer, so there's really no need for this.  If you are a dedicated consumer electronic DVD player person, then these work, but it looks like there are no special features.

"Say this much for the Brits they sure know how to make great Armageddon movies i.e ""Twenty Eight Days Later"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"".  ""Perfect Sense"" works for the most part but doesn't quite hit it out of the ballpark.  Where it is most successful is in portraying the world breaking down.  Director David MacKenzie probably didn't have the resources of your typical Hollywood disaster pic but he successfully melds scenes of his own creation with news footage to create a society in chaos.  Where the film falls short is in its central conceit of the world falling deeper into the abyss as the passion between the central lovers(Ewan McGregor and Eva Green) intensifies.  Are these events the result of the lovers actions or despite them?  The film, to me, doesn't give a satisfactory answer.  This is no fault of McGregor and Green whose scenes together have a charged eroticism.  Ultimately, though, ""Perfect Sense"" is an interesting film that falls short of greatness.",Positive
"I think this is supposed to be a comedy?  I wasn't quite sure since there were a couple funny lines, but not anything to make me laugh a lot.  The plot was really dumb, and the characters were typical stereotypical characters.  How many times are we going to see a soccer player as the kicker in football?  Geesh.  I'll pass on this show.",Negative
The fourth season was great! Just like the television series but without the commercials and pop-ups. The commentaries were great. I just wish the people that make decisions would have ended it differently.,Positive
"I have to admit, I started watching this show half-expecting to hate it. The idea is well-traveled science-fiction terrain, with last year's 'Oblivion', starring Tom Cruise, being one of the closest and most recent comparison's. But that happens all the time in Hollywood, with nearly identical film concepts racing each other to theaters to end up playing simultaneously: 'Armageddon' and 'Deep Impact', for example, or this year's 'The Double' and 'Enemy', both about emotionally crippled young men who have their lives upended by extroverted doppelgangers. But I thought 'The 100' seemed like a cynical cash-grab counting on fans of 'The Hunger Games' and 'Divergent' to tune in. Well, it certainly will appeal to the same demographic, but this series, based on a book by Kass Morgan, is much more than a cynical cash-grab.It begins on 'The Ark', where a small remnant of humanity have lived for nearly a century, waiting for the radioactive aftermath of a nuclear holocaust -- which came close to rendering mankind extinct -- to dissipate. As the Ark, a cobbled-together amalgam of various space stations like 'Mir' in geo-stationary orbit, nears the end of it's life-expectancy, the ruling council makes a desperate decision. In a society where the punishment for virtually every crime is being blown out an air-lock, or 'floated', they still don't execute their young offenders. But when the series begins, following 17-year old Clarke as she and her fellow prisoners are taken from their cells, her mother -- who is a Doctor and member of the ruling council -- tells her that she and 99 others are being taken to a Drop-ship bound for Earth.What follows is an exciting and well-written tale that borrows liberally from film and literature without seeming wholly derivative. There are elements of 'Lord of the Flies' and 'Lost', of course, which seem like the story's primary influences. When the 100 discover that the Earth is not the wasteland they thought it was, but is instead teeming with life (including unlikely but entertaining monstrous mutations straight out of a 1950's B-movie), they have no way of contacting the Ark to report the good news. In a remarkably short-sighted move, they did nothing more than equip them with metal bracelets that send back telemetry limited to heart monitoring, which would theoretically inform the Ark of a subjects' death, but not how that death occurred. As the kids on Earth come to terms with their new life, the situation on the Ark becomes dire, as the CO2-scrubbers fail, and the only way to buy time is to reduce the number of people breathing...The first several episodes deal with parallel power struggles on the ground and in orbit, as Clarke battles the charismatic Bellamy over their course of action; Clarke is determined to tell the Ark that the radiation is gone, while Bellamy does everything he can to convince them otherwise. Commanding the loyalty of the more hardcore delinquents with an anarchistic philosophy, he takes measures to mislead the Ark into thinking they're dead and dying, fearing that if anyone from the Ark makes it to Earth, his time will be up. But when they discover they are not alone, and these mysterious 'Grounders' (who are reminiscent of 'The Others' from Lost) kidnap and injure one person and eventually kill others, the idea of having more people from the Ark to help them against their newfound enemies seems like a good idea. Meanwhile, Clarke's mother fights another council member ('Desmond' from Lost) who believes that 'culling' 300 people is their only choice, while she desperately searches for proof that the 100 are (mostly) alive, and the ground is safe.Over the first 13 episodes the cast, the writing, and the production have been excellent; while it's clearly targeting a younger teenage demographic, the stories are told with a maturity that any fans of science fiction should enjoy, filled with the heartrending dilemmas and impossible ethical decisions good drama is made of. There are typical problems with the science getting a bit fictitious, and it occasionally falls back on SF cliches -- every series I've seen does an episode where the characters start hallucinating that they're talking to dead people -- but for the most part, the writers and producers come up with fresh ideas for every episode, utilizing the tension between the Ark, the 100, and the Grounders effectively. The relationships have an honest, natural feel, and the dialogue is actually quite good as well; so many shows fail with the dialogue, when writers in their thirties or forties have already forgotten their high school years, and write terrible, snarky conversations for the young actors that sounds like bad, embarrassing parody. I'm not going to say there's none of that, but it's kept to a minimum. Highly Recommended.",Positive
"I love this show, it keeps me on the edge of my seat with every episod, can't wait to see seson 5",Positive
"I was so excited for season 2 to start back up. Had to wait a very long time, and it was well worth the wait. The first episode draws you in instantly. Intense battles, passion, honor, and family. I have truly been waiting for a series like this. The Cinematography is beautiful. The acting, outstanding. Highly recommend.",Positive
"This series is well worth the time invested in watching Charles Dickens' classic unfold.  I never understood it so well reading it in High school. Until I saw this version, which is so well acted, the incredibly complex characters of Dickens world do truly come to life.  There is so much merit in the many messages projected in this series from what brings real happiness in life to who is a real debtor, to what constitutes a good and noble person.  I will watch this series again and again, as there is so much wisdom and insight to gain from seeing it over and over.At first the different English and French accents may be hard to follow, as we are not so accustomed to hearing these dialects but with patience it becomes clearer and more easily understandable.  Well worth the time and patience.",Positive

"Controversial as this film already is (the critics hate it, those who have watched it either hate or love it), it is a solid stretch of cinematic art by writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn. He is an artist who challenges audiences and takes enormous risks: his 1996 film, the extremely violent and uncompromising PUSHER became a cult phenomenon and won Refn instant international critical acclaim. That was followed by BLEEDER and the now cult classic DRIVE. Each of these films is highly stylized and focuses on introverted reactions to outward situations. ONLY GOD FORGIVES pushes those traits even further: completely set in Thailand it weighs in on Asian symbolism, spiritualism and response to revenge or own hand rights. It is very dark, both in the cinematography of Larry Smith and in the ever-present veneer of killing and death and mutilation. The entire film is a study in color manipulation, slow movement (as in Noh theater), minimal dialog, and even more minimal character development. And yet somehow Refn makes all of this work to his advantage to hold the audience, as though imprisoned, to examine the extents of evil.The setting is Bangkok. Ten years ago Julian (Ryan Gosling) killed a man and went on the run. Now he manages a Thai boxing club as a front for a drugs operation. Respected in the criminal underworld, deep inside, he feels empty. When Julian's brother Billy (Tom Burke) murders an underage prostitute, the police call on retired cop Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) - the Angel of Vengeance whose other obsession is Karaoke singing. Chang allows the father to kill his daughter's murderer, then 'restores order' by chopping off the man's right hand. Julian's mother Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas) - the foul-mouthed nasty head of a powerful criminal organization - arrives in Bangkok to collect her favorite first son's body. She charges Julian to find his killers and 'raise hell'. Despite being beaten severely in a fight with Chang, Julian's inability to react to anything - even to the physical relationship with a strange girl Mai (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam) - leads to mayhem that in many ways does not even seem to affect him.The casting is strange: obviously Ryan Gosling was hired for the role of Julian because of his works with Reyn in DRIVE. He is called upon to do very little and as a result we are not able to appreciate his motivation or his presence in the story.  Kristin Scott Thomas is a brilliant actress but here she is merely a source of filthy accusations and Kabuki-like poses. The star of the film is Vithaya Pansringarm, and even though we loathe him and his malicious manner he alone gives us an idea of why he is doing what he is doing, framing it all with obnoxious Karaoke singing in a garish nightclub.  Everything about the film is slow and dark and yet for some obscure reason it works.  Grady Harp, July 13",Positive
"While I have only watched a few episodes it is a well done show by Investigators who all a have experience from others show such as Destination truth and Fact or Fake, it is shot in a style somewhat like the Ghost Adventures with a touch of the Blair witch project tossed in.  The investigations are new and fresh not just rehashing of the same subjects seen on other shows.  For the price it is worth watching.  If you like myself are an aficionado of the genre then it is worth a watch.",Positive
"I read the book a while back--all 1,000+ pages of it--and as a long-time Stephen King fan, I enjoyed his verbosity and virtuosity.  The TV version promises to be as long-winded as the book, since it will be coming back for a second season, so I wonder what exactly King will add to it to make us care that these people are still trapped under the dome.This take on UTD is soapier, sexier, and with nastier bad guys.  I kinda sorta like it--it's entertaining enough for a summer evening--but it is what it is:  an escapist TV series, soon forgotten.  I'm feeling more claustrophobic every week just thinking about all those disparate characters trapped together. Don't know if I'll last through the second season because I can't really identify with any of the characters.",Negative
"I have been playing the game along with watching the TV series and the link between the two is inspired. As this review is about the TV series lets get into that now:The characters are interesting, the pilot episode wasn't really showing the best of the series so far as they tried to fit in a Romeo & Juliette side story and a big battle, it gets better in the 2nd episode. The characters develop quickly and the real story starts forming pretty quickly.The art style sometimes looks CG and even animated at times which when you hear it sounds like it could ruin a TV show but when you see it in practise the art works really well with the setting.",Positive
"This is one nicely filmed but mean as heck crime thriller with as many twists and turns as your favorite roller coaster. The two kidnapping criminals play the main part. These unsavory individuals are not there for the viewer to like or to identify with. They are innately repugnant. The worst of the two of them is suspicious of everything and ready to get crazy violent at any second. The victim is pretty, but she is no more pleasant than the criminals. The bad guys have the whole thing planned out and practiced really well, but a lot of unexpected stuff happens and the plan gets desperate really quickly - and the viewer has no idea who will survive this scenerio. There are some really suspenseful moments that will keep the viewer on the edge of the seat. There is a ton of tension and drama between the three characters. The acting is all around very good. Beyond the kidnapping, a few tussles and some bondage, there isnt much violence. There is no need for extreme blood and gore. There is some (hetero and homo) sexual content, and there is a healthy dose of (male and female) nudity. If you start this movie, you wont want to stop until it concludes and you can finally stop holding your breath.",Positive
"It initially was difficult to like the characters in the first season of ""Sons of Anarchy"". The criminals were violent with little about them to like. The surrounding characters seemed to have been drawn into their bad situations at their own choosing. Even the ""good guy"" law enforcement personnel were deeply flawed and generally despicable. As the season progresses, the story lines and conflicts became more intriguing. The season ends well with one wanting to find out what the future holds.There are some general plot lines of ""Sons of Anarchy"" that are reminiscent of ""The Sopranos"". Both series had mother figures with a strong presence where one realizes that, in a family feud, the mother has deliberately and potentially let her son be placed at risk. That is some wake up call for the main character. In both series, the main characters need to consider how to handle ""a rat"", yet to give ""Sons of Anarchy"" great credit, their story line on this is gripping. This is a series that slowly grabs the viewer and pulls the viewer in.",Positive
"Black Dahlia features an excellent cast working off well written scripts. The concept: is there s copycat killer following the details of long unsolved LA murders, allows for wink and a nod to cop shows of the past while remaining fresh.

"This show takes an exciting look at a crucial time in history.  If you can get past the sex scenes, the show does a great job showing this complex time in England.",Positive
"Season Two of the TV series ""Jericho"" wasn't supposed to happen... the taut, terrifying post-apocalyptic drama had been canceled due to weak ratings, but was revived by the network after intense lobbying by fans.  In this second season, the claustrophobia of Season One gives way to paranoia as the town of Jericho is taken over by a provisional Federal government based in Nebraska. As it turns out, this new government is the result of a political conspiracy, and the citizens of Jericho, like Kansans in the 1850s and '60s, are caught in the middle of a chilling civil war.The ensemble acting of the first season is replaced by a fast-moving, plot-heavy political narrative over which contemporary (Iraq War-era) politics cast a long shadow. The new government installs a Halliburton-like mega-corporation in charge of all economic activity in the town; this company also owns a private, mercenary security force (ala Blackwater) which terrorizes the locals. Finally, the townspeople have to take a stand: are they going to knuckle under to a powerful, remote dictatorship, or will the spirit of 1776 survive?  Action junkies and fans of political conspiracy-theory films will dig this.  Although it may feel a little rushed, this short season (only seven episodes were made) ties up most of the loose ends, and should satisfy most fans.  Fun stuff, and a little scary, too.

"I am a big NCIS fan.  Excuse me, I WAS a big NCIS fan.  I have seasons 1 through 7 on DVD.  I may have season 8 also, but I can't find it at the moment.  Starting in season 6 I noticed a falling off in the quality of the show; the writing just didn't seem as good.  Now with season 9 on DVD I see a huge falling off in picture quality as well.  The DVD picture quality is blurry, and in no way compares with the sharpness of the earlier seasons on DVD.  What?  Are they trying to get me to upgrade to Blu-Ray by deliberately selling me inferior DVDs?Between the inferior picture quality, and the sub-par writing, I'm sorry, NCIS has lost me as a fan.  @hg47",Negative
"The show starts out strong but the constant, never ending struggle with Lulu (she seriously should have gone to Berkeley and STAYED) and the fact that Nick never gets ahead. Not once. Is just depressing.This isn't gritty realism. It's sadistic storytelling and masochistic tv viewing. It reminds me a lot of the tragic train-wreck  Queer as Folk:US became in its final season. (Dear God was it bad).  It's like the writers of The Guardian knew the show would be cancelled so they decided to send the Fallins down in flames.  A shame really.  Sure Nick is not in jail (oh, that a spoiler?) and he is where I figured he'd be when I started watching the series but everything else? It wasn't even interesting to watch.  Sort of like watching those mandatory car crash videos in drivers ed.In the end, the only people I could stand to see on screen were Nick and his father. They'd even managed to make Shannon unlikable thanks, in part, to her behavior towards Burton.I don't know why US TV Shows destroy themselves when they are cancelled.  Learn from the British guys and class it up. End it right and realize you still have to sell streaming and DVDs.",Negative

"I was a little disappointed in the 2nd season of Heroes.  Not because of the acting, but because it was so short.  Turns out this was filmed during the writers' strike, so they had to cut the season down to eleven episodes.This meant that the story-lines weren't as fully explored as they could have been, and there was a lot less content.All of that detracted from an otherwise entertaining show.Moving on to Season 3....",Positive

"Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Big Ass Spider!&#8221;1. This enjoyable, ultra-low budget Z-movie is kind of like those movies made for the SyFy Channel, except better.2. It&#8217;s about, well, a big ass spider.3. A spider eats it&#8217;s way out of a dead body at a hospital, and goes on a rampage, growing really fast, making webs, and spitting acid on people.4. A goofy exterminator named Alex and a Mexican security guard named Jose find themselves competing with the military to find and kill the spider.5. The movie clearly wasn&#8217;t trying to take itself serious. It knows exactly what it is, and revels in it. As proof that the director knows what he was making, Lloyd Kaufman has a cameo (if you don&#8217;t know who Lloyd Kaufman is, don&#8217;t worry about it. It would take too long to explain).6. The budget is so low that apparently the director actually cast the film from his Facebook friends. The special effects are pretty bad, except for the spider. I think all the money went to making the spider. It looks pretty cool.7. It&#8217;s also really funny. The main characters, Alex and Jose, have a great chemistry and comic timing.8. It&#8217;s an homage to other monster movies, and you can find references to many other films here.9. If you are expecting an actual horror monster movie, you will hate this. But if you&#8217;re in the mood for a stupid-smart, good-natured monster comedy, then this is something you&#8217;ll want to check out.",Positive
"This &#34;con-man with a heart of gold&#34; is sexy, smart, charming and a cautionary tale that men like this are high-risk involvements so don't expect much in the way of commitment.  What saves this show from moral ambiguity is the basic goodness and sense of justice toward the individual.  My favorite show, by far, due mostly to Matt Bomer.  Yeah, he's gorgeous, but he's also a great actor.  I love watching him act, that subtle weight shift with the slight smirk (and many other such moments each episode) just blow me away.  Plus twice a year there is a fabulous, original stunt.  Love the show.",Positive
"When I caught bit of her show on TV, I didn't get it.I never really liked her character on The Office either.Once I started watching the DVD from the first episode, I fell in love with Mindy and the entire cast.Nobody was shocked about that fact more than I but oh what a joy!  What a find!Ike Barinholtz is someone I did not like when I saw him on TV years ago.Well now I LOVE his character and his acting on this show.I love every single cast member, even Beverly.Whoever cast this show, who ever wrote an episode or directed, pat yourselves on the back.Bravo!I love love this show.

Love the familiar faces, especially the funny folks from MadTV (Will Sasso especially).The producer of the show gets drunk with some local dimwits and asks them to explain some part of history relevant to their town.

"Once Upon a Time has become the most original and moving fantasy on television, reinterpreting the old fairy tales yet remaining true to their message of hope, courage and grace under pressure. The residents of Storybrooke Maine are fairytale characters who have been enchanted and transported into our world with no memory of their lives in the Enchanted Forest. Emma Swann, daughter of Snow and Charming was sent away before the curse struck so she could fulfill her destiny of breaking the curse. The first season alternates between the present in Storyville and the past in the Enchanted Forest, retelling all of the tales that we love so much.In the second season, the curse is broken, but a new curse has taken its place, trapping the residents of Storyville, with their memories, but unable to leave. Snow and her daughter Emma are now trapped in the Enchanted Forest looking for a way back to Storyville and a way to break the curse. In this episode, Rumpelstiltskin and his past are under the microscope. Just how did Rumpel become the dark one and why did he trap the residents of Storyville again just as the curse of Regina was lifted. The answers may surprise you but they will always delight. A wonderful backstory for a classic villain. Captain Hook makes an appearance as well and we finally learn just how the crocodile got his hand.Watch Once Upon a Time, start with the first season and keep going as this reinvention of the classic tales is enchanting, well written, well acted and all of the production values are superb. In particular, the costumer and set designer must be having a field day of fun. Just wonderful.",Positive

"This show is interesting to me since the featured mountain men (and associated women) need to do certain things in order to survive due to their chosen lifestyle.  Still, the recaps when the show switches from one person to another are tedious.  For instance, one mountain man's dog keeps getting &#34;lost&#34; and a bear could eat it.  This goes on for several scenes but interspersed is another mountain man's need to fly his personal airplane to a remote cabin in Alaska, so viewers will be reintroduced to the &#34;missing&#34; dog scenario several times before the dog comes bounding home.  The dog goes missing twice in two different scenes - once out hunting and once at home - I found this to be contrived.To be fair, many shows do this now.  I suppose it is done to add airtime padding when no new film footage exists but I so dislike it.  For shows like Mystery Diagnosis which keeps my interest such that I want to find out what is ailing the person(s),  I record it so I can fast forward through the recaps.  What will transpire with the contrived scenario of the &#34;missing&#34; dog does not hold my interest enough for me to bother with it.

"Creative,  a very different take on an American classic. Love the Raiders of the Lost Ark feel.  The tie in with scripture is fun but hardly accurate.  It leaves the viewer with the false notion that we can control the end of the world events in a tangible way. Irving's Crane was very different from this, but trying to do this story without the broad background of Sleepy Hollow would have impossible odds for success. Five stars for creative effort, three stars for staying close to the original, four stars overall.",Positive
"The war ends and with it this series which is one of my favorites.  Strongly suggest watching the at least the first series, before watching this one, because otherwise you won't appreciate some of the relevations.Besides, the entire series is great, so why jump ahead to the end?",Positive
"If you like dogs or cats, this is the show for you!  It's interesting to learn about new breeds and see them grow up. You'll fall in love!",Positive
"I love getting to see all the different countries and seeing what the homes look inside, helps me decide where I want to visit.",Positive
"It's hard to get hooked on a show with just one episode, but with this, having watched just 30 minutes is enough to entice you. It's a satirical take on how today's Media is controlled by big corporations and ""the wealthy few"" (as if you had doubts). It's humorous, witty, and full of twisted characters that make you go ""WTF LOL"".Also, the humor of this show reminds me of Naked Gun. Awesome!P.S. Pun intended, of course.",Positive
"I really did love this show, until the characters started changing and the story line took off in a different direction.  Bring back all the old characters.  They were great.  The new ones are ok, but don't think I&#34;ll be watching this show if it continues on the same path.",Negative
"I liked it more in the beginning than towards the end as the main character, Maria Wern and her huge hair, became more and more irritating. Good supporting characters and excellent story-lines for each episode.",Positive
"A solid 4 stars movie! Great creature, but with too many roars. Not a very predictable movie and definitely not predictable as to who will survive and who won't. Wish the creature didn't die that easy. Wishing for a sequel! It's a very good movie, and definitely very well made. Could be greater, but it's really, really good as it is now. Oh and by the way.. it got me at least twice. And it wasn't super awfully gory, which I like. A must see!",Positive
"Loving season 2! The first few episodes of season 1 had me watching with lights on. Season 2 hasn't been as frightening in the ""ghost story"" sense, but it has been terrifying on many other levels. The asylum setting (and the people who may or may NOT belong there) gives me alot of anxiety. The storylines are interesting. The writing is sick, twisted, and brilliant. And the acting is superb--Jessica Lange rocks it once again as a deranged and vindictive nun and Sarah Paulson is a sight to behold. This is not a continuation of the first season (come on people, do you NOT have internet access?!). Some of the actors are the same, but their characters--and the storyline--are completely different. If you are not enjoying season 2--you're doing it WRONG!",Positive
"I was disappointed to find that this show was a complete set up.  I guess I should have known, but the characters are obnoxious and out of control.",Negative
"Overall, really loved it. Again, Timothy Olyphant and Walton Goggins did  a great job. I really enjoy the humor and sarcasm that Raylan is so good at.",Positive
We have really enjoyed watching this program. All the things people think of to do is so funny and sometimes very intense.,Positive
"The town of Chester's Mill is sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible dome. The inhabitants - and various visitors - have to manage dwindling supplies and social disorder whilst trying to figure out how to escape.We live in a golden age of television, with TV shows pushing further in crafting excellent narratives and creating compelling characters out of even the most mundane of situations. Rising budgets and production values mean that TV shows now often look like movies, sometimes with big movie stars opting for the less-lucrative but more creatively and artistically rewarding opportunities to slowly explore and develop characters over hours and maybe years. It's a great time to be a TV fan.Under the Dome therefore stands as a stark warning that we should not be complacent or overconfident that this is a state that will last forever. Under the Dome is a horrible show, so terrible that on a fundamental level all involved with it must know how bad it is, and therefore can only have made it deliberately as a warning to others to stay on the ball and avoid this show's pitfalls.Under the Dome is based on Stephen King's quite excruciatingly awful novel of the same name, but in a move that is actually impressive, is awful for completely different reasons. The primary weaknesses of King's novel - the ludicrous implausibility at how quickly everything disintegrates and its unhealthy obsession with raping Twilight fans (seriously Stephen, we know you're a Harry Potter fan but that's just juvenile) - are fortunately missing from the TV show. Brian K. Vaughan - the man credited with saving Lost from a dip in form during its early third season - has great credentials and is a good enough writer to know what to change from the book (i.e. almost everything apart from the dome itself and a few character names) to make it work on TV. But pretty much none of it does work.The biggest problem is the total lack of decent, compelling characters. Our main lead appears to be Dale 'Barbie' Barbara, but he is a rather unsympathetic killer and thug. Actor Mike Vogel initially gives it his all, but after a couple of episodes seems to realise that the inexplicable lurches in his character's motivations aren't going away and decides to sleep-walk through the rest of the series. Rachelle Lefevre also gamely engages with her character of Julia before realising she doesn't have a character, just a cliche (unconventional journalist from out of town with totally amazing hair), and likewise phones it in. The young kids are more enthusiastic and get some credit for being the only people in town actually bothered about what the dome is and where it came from, but their lack of experience and some poor direction results in them lurching from painfully over-acting to massively underselling big moments.There are some good points in the cast. Natalie Martinez's character of Linda has some bizarre character turns and is rather gullible at times, but she at least just about manages to sell the idea of a character cracking up from the stress of the situation (whether that was the aim or not). Dean Norris also brings some much-needed charisma to the antagonistic role of 'Big Jim' Rennie, even if some of his quite astonishing lines are delivered through teeth hugely gritted as he tries to forget he went from filming Breaking Bad to this mess (a drop in quality only comparable to Natalie Portman appearing in Black Swan and then Your Highness). However, the good work of others is undone by Alexander Koch as Junior. His utter lack of acting talent and the way he seems to have only three stand-by expressions he moves between, sometimes randomly, is almost hypnotic. It's certainly the worst performance by a regular in a TV series that I've seen in many, many years.The writing is also awful. Brian K. Vaughan has some seriously good work to his name, but he seems unable to employ it here. Dialogue is expositionary, unconvincing and wooden in the extreme. You can predict how entire scenes will go - sometimes down to lines - from their opening moments. The show also starts back-pedalling from its premise - a bunch of people trapped together in a dome - immediately by periodically bringing in new characters and unconvincingly explaining they've been in hiding since the dome came down. When the writing doesn't even have the courage to deal with the basic premise of the show, there's a huge problem.Under the Dome's first season (*) is almost irredeemably bad. The writing is almost completely bad, the acting is mostly bad, very little about it (from character motivations to the supply situation to the utter lack of contact with the outside world after the third or fourth episode) makes any kind of sense and the whole thing feels like a big, dead, inert weight. A few flashes of competence from a couple of the actors are the only thing that makes watching it even remotely bearable. Still, it's a vast improvement on the novel.",Negative
This series was so heartwarming.  The setting was very beautiful and authentic to the time period.  The stories were very interesting and uplifting even though some one died in every episode.  The series made me laugh and cry.  It was a series that my husband and I watched marathon style....We couldn't quit watching.!!!!,Positive
"I lived in Iceland for 6 years and learned the culture and folk lore of the country as well as vikings, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.  This series comes pretty close to nailing it but it could use more sex, songs, and dark poetry.  From my readings as well living among  these people I think Viking culture was more violent than portrayed here,  andreciting  dark odes in the night with lots of red wine would be a very commkon ways to pass away the brutal winter months.  The womem would have been as sexually agressive as the men, independent spirits, and  very capable/skilled fighters.  That being said I really enjoyed the 1st season and do look forward to season 2.",Positive
"This series is about siblings (two sisters and a brother) living separate lives in L.A., who are summoned to their father's house for a family dinner so that he can make an announcement.  Without giving anything away, this was a great start to what I think could be a fantastic series.  Each character has his or her own personal issues they are dealing with, but when they are all together it is such a joy to just watch them interact with each other.The casting was great, from recognizable actors/actresses (Jeffrey Tambor, Gaby Hoffman) to ones I was not familiar with, but who seem like perfect finds.  I think it will probably have a nice balance of humor, tugs at the heartstrings, and cringe-worthy moments.I could easily imagine this as an HBO, Showtime, or Netflix series.  It has that premium cable quality that I've come to expect from those networks.  The closest comparison I can think of is Six Feet Under, which is one of my all time favorite TV series.  No surprise, since the creator of Transparent was a writer on Six Feet Under.If you are a fan of family* dramas/dramedies (ex: Six Feet Under, United States of Tara, Shameless), or just dramas/dramedies in general (Orange is the New Black, Enlightened) you would probably like this show.*By family, I do not mean family-friendly: this has mature content, including sex, language, and nudity. I mean it is centered around a family.I hope Amazon orders more of this series.",Positive
This one is what i expected of green arrow.  Though so far im hoping for more change and developement in the character.  I liked smallville how the character developed.  Though so far its doesnt have too much development toward the character.  So I gave it a 4 star.  Hoping the character developes a bit more as the story goes otherwise the story goes stagnet.  Where its a numerous stories but no change to the character starts to bore me.,Positive
This show seemed like something that would be right up my alley....it just falls flat in my opinion. I've already removed from my watchlist.,Negative
"This show is my guilty pleasure. This season we are no closer to figuring out who A is! It's like a train wreak, you don't want to watch but you can't look away! I started reading the pretty little liars books and now I'm more aggravated! But I won't stop until I reach the end of either one!",Positive
"I was expecting bad. Ok, pretty bad. However, I have been pleasantly surprised.It started off strong and has continued strong. The actors have done a good job and the storylines are interesting. At this point, it is difficult to tell where all the subplots are going. Nothing appears cheap, cheesy, B rated nor low budget.Honestly, I am kinda shocked that it is as good as it is.Is it just me, or does the actress that plays the deputy remind you of Jo from Eureka?",Negative
Fantastic concept. If this was a series... I would have watched it in a weekend. Certainly a show worth making.,Positive
"the series was really good, so i watched the first 2 seasons.then when i got to season 3, amazon wants to charge for each episode. if amazon starts a series ==== all episodes should be FREE FREE FREE FREE",Positive
"No spoilers here.  Simply a great family show with humor, good, evil, bravery and sacrifice.  We could use more shows like this.",Positive
We have thorougly enjoyed this series. I plan to watch it until they have stopped running episodes. It downloads right away with no issues. Thanks Amazon! reat movie!,Positive
A good story line and good acting.  It's a good thing I don't have to wait for a whole week before catching the next episode.  I was working nights when this was originally on TV so never got to watch it then.  It would have been very hard to wait for a week before seeing the next episode.  This series is very addictive.,Positive
"As promised, the acting, cinematography, and general production values are top notch.  But like the Sopranos, I find the content toxic and depressing.  There is already a pattern of a buildup of tension and a narrow escape.  This chemistry teacher is going to have to come up with more complicated strategies to pull off this double life.  But he seems to have a sociopathic disregard for the lives he's destroying even as his own body is wasting away.  I'm simply not up for 40 more hours of covert drug manufacturers.",Negative
"I like science fiction series.  I am an avid fan of arrow.  I expected this to be a three star feature at best.  I am glad to be wrong.  I eagerly go home to watch this series.  I started it on a weekend, cand finished 10 episodes before the weekend was done!  If you like movies about extraordinary people, you will like this series.",Positive
"A strong contender, as far as original series go.  I thought the second half of the episode had more laughs and caught my attention.",Positive
I have been a big fan from the beginning.  Like the characters who have grown and changed from season to season while still remaining &#34;who they are&#34;.  The humor is fun and not mean.I find myself laughing with the characters and the situation they get themselves into and not at them or someone else.,Positive
I love this show. It's funny and interesting and not boring. It's different than any other show out there. I would recommend this show.,Positive
Shallow Bio's to much WWII revisionist histrionics. Lot'a old footage seen a 1000 times.  Not a scholarly epic.,Negative
I love this show its always so entertaining. I would def recommend it this show been watching it for the past few seasons.,Positive
"Although I watch the first episode with a huge grain of salt (the topic seemed a bit of a clich&eacute; for the sci-fi person), I was immediately caught by the acting, the nuances, flaws, and chemistry of the characters in themselves and interacting with each other. Dorian, the humanoid cop, is fantastic, surprising, and emotionally compelling. His human pal, detective John Kennex, plays well the conflicted, not too good at communicating detective, who is more sensitive, good-hearted, and compassionate than his thick-skinned, damaged cop surface shows. The two of them working together are a pleasure to watch. So are the characters around, all rich and intriguing. Lily Taylor as Captain Maldonado is just royal. Detective Stahl is more than eye candy, and the in house robotics expert played by Mackenzie Crook, is fun. The tough to annoying cop Det Paul, is right on the note as well.The big problem is that while casting and acting are top notch, the writing seems often an afterthought. The fascinating world in which the live is hardly delved with. The terrorist group that has costed Det Kennex his leg, his men, and a broken heart, are not a thing that one can pin down during season 1. The crazy criminals and crimes they pursue are always too superficially addressed. No topic grows or is a thing except the friendship between Dorian and his human colleague. The central topic -- what  is to be human? -- is hardly addressed by anything else than Dorian's moving reactions to some crimes and use of androids by humans. The chances offered by potential conversations between him and others androids (Danika in the finale for instance) are cut by action scenes that often seem too long. The pischo who killed people to get more views for his game was just one more villain to get obsessed with John, as if there were not other humans in the city. The writing is so superficial, inane, and clich&eacute; that you can often write the plot of the entire episode after two or three scenes. A shame. The show has great potential. They should hire people who can make it happen.",Negative
"Can't give a good review. Couldn't get into movie. I know it has a good lineup of stars, but interrupted and could not get back into movie. Slow start.",Negative
"Yes, I understand that this is technically &#34;kids&#34; programming but you know what? The &#34;kids&#34; grew up and were replaced by new ones with new TV tastes. It would be really interesting to know just what percentage of viewers who watch Marvel & DC related shows are actually 6 - 14 years old?So forgive me if I insult or omit anyone's favorite program when I opinion that it's a pretty pitiful state of affairs when cancellations and subsequent new programming have left us with not much else to consume than this irritating buffoonery. IGN rates this show 5.8 out of 10 while IMDB is slightly more generous in its 6.5 ranking. Either way, these numbers add up to a series case of &#34;mediocrity&#34;.Where are the creators like Bruce Timm & Christopher Yost, or the shows like &#34;X-Men&#34; - &#34;Spawn&#34; - &#34;The Maxx&#34; - &#34;Batman: TAS&#34; - &#34;Superman: TAS&#34; - &#34;Justice League (Unlimited)&#34; - &#34;The Spectacular Spider-man&#34; - &#34;The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes&#34;? Does anyone even understand how the same writer (Paul Dini) who produced &#34;Batman: TAS&#34; can also be involved in this &#34;Agents of S.M.A.S.H.&#34;? How did this all go so far astray?",Negative
"It ultimately fails to deliver on the pretext of the ""The Future of Digital Film"" since it's really an analysis of the history and current state of film production. That aside, it's absolutely fascinating to hear from a dozen or so very big names about their thoughts on the subject of digital versus celluloid. I even thought Keanu Reeves was much better as an interviewer than I expected.The digital notables are there - James Cameron, George Lucas and Robert Rodriguez - to promote the digital revolution but actually all of them make some extremely insightful comments. Whatever you think of George Lucas, you have to admit that the man has the finger on the technology pulse in movies and his opinions are almost prophetic in this regard. When pressed about the 'unreality' of digital processing, James Cameron gave an awesome response along of the lines of ""How was anything in the movies ever real? The raining downtown midnight New York scene was shot in daytime Burbank with a rain machine and 30 people in the background"". Rodriguez, whom I was lucky enough to meet at RISE Austin this year, sees digital as an enabling tool - and this is from a man that shot a feature film for $15K so if you enjoy movies, you must listen to the guy.There's a good balance from film purists too, and I was surprised to see Chris Nolan in the celluloid camp. There are some valid criticisms of digital filming and processing but the documentary leans towards suggesting that the chemical method of the past is really coming to an end. Some of the newer professional movie cameras are shown and it's fascinating to hear the DPs talking about their pros and cons historically.This is definitely a big hit for film fans who love the technical stuff though not so much for the rest (my wife fell asleep). Personally I'd love to see more industry topics covered in this format since almost everything that's a DVD extra is basically:- Actors saying nice things about each other and the director- Green screen magic without showing any post-production whatsoever- Plugging the next installment or merchandiseAfter watching the whole thing, it's pretty clear that since sound and editing went digital years ago, the camera is going to follow the same path and you'll be telling your grand-kids about how actual film worked.",Positive
"I watched the entire series in one day! It was really full of adventure and new things, with a 85 b.c. background.  Loved it.",Positive
"there is no way a blind person can do what that character does, which makes it fiction and not realistic.  she is to much into her self and is really not that bright.  too make believe.  there are two excellent actors in this series; however they have minor roles which is too bad.",Negative
It was not what I expected and narration was boring. I could hardly stay connected and was glad when it was over.,Negative
I love this show. They did so well on the animation and h Jon Benjamin is amazing and hilarious. Awesome!,Positive
Could not stop watching.  We are definantly hooked on this series and have our DVR set for Thursday nights now.  But it is nice to know that if we do miss a show we can catch up on Prime.,Positive
"This is a great series with a very realistic premise, excellent script and acting, and super special effects and make up. The  character development  is great from Day One and progresses to the point one feels they personally know the characters and experience many of the same emotions as the characters do so within the show....Enjoyable and one I look forward to viewing...",Positive
"Actually found this series to be more interesting than expected. Some of the cases were familiar. For this type series, it is well presented.

"This film lost me in the first 5 minutes, but I gave it a chance because I loved Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek. This movie does nothing to showcase her amazing talent.  And her chemistry with Seth Rogen was non-existent.  Totally insipid movie.",Negative
Dynamite series with all kinds of relationship nuances.  The Russians are much more interesting than the counterpart Americans!  Can't wait for Season 2 to begin.,Positive
I must be out of touch. My sex life was not this active when I was in high school so I am unsure if this is JH/HS appropriate. But I guess this is what they watch on MTV. Was interesting enough as a study of what teens are watching.,Positive
"we still have the show in high school AND new york city. although i am enjoying the musical numbers in the high school, i am enjoying far more the adult story in new york. i am especially enjoying the story with kurt where he has gone into the fashion industry with sarah jessica parker instead of ahow biz like rachel. he means for this to be a temporary detour but he is very well suited for being in the fashion industry. at this point if they wanted to spin off a new show with kurt in the fashion industry, i would be following right along with the new show. having half a new cast in the high school version is jarring, they are still not melding very well. also, making sue sylvester into a nicer person may be a mistake.  i for one miss those funny segments where she was editorializing on tv with her utterly outrageous views. in short, this show needs to recover its equilibrium but it still does great musical performances,",Positive
"The special effects are really poor, even for SciFi. This series is tied into a computer game, something that is going to be the next con job (like action figures became, where the made a series just to sell toys). Maybe the graphics are so bad because they wanted to match the 8 year old consoles graphics? I watched the pilot in 3 sittings because I got bored and started doing something else.They should have kept Alphas, or some other good series, instead of making this.",Negative

He can create emotion with a lift of an eyebrow.",Positive
"My husband and I absolutely love In Plain Sight! We started watching it on Netflix a while ago and were super disappointed when Netflix didn't add seasons 4 and 5. Luckily, we were able to buy it on Amazon Instant Video and watch it that way! It is a good, clean show about 2 US Marshall's working in the witness protection program. It's action packed, suspenseful, and just enough drama. We have nothing but good things to say about it!",Positive
"good acting, good storyline, engaging. dont need any more words that this. the clothes and styling were boring though not very believable.",Positive
Just continues to go down hill.  I can see why the network did not renew.  A disappointing finish to a show with a great potential.,Negative

I HAD NO  IDEA HOW OVER THE TOP with sex and violnce this series would be . i will not watch again,Negative
I liked this program because it shows there is always another side to people and things we put on pedestals.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know more of the truth about an individual or religion.  Because the whole truth will never be in the history books.  Very interesting and informative.,Positive
From this show I am learning how to read micro expressions this is a very interesting study and like many others I am choosing to learn threw watching tv rather than reading.,Positive
"I hope Discovery doent keep this up in this new package. This new Spec ops guy is annoying. I'm not sure if Disc. channel is doing this on purpose or what, but the additinal DRAMA is not that interesting. This new guy is cocky and doesnt appear to know much about survival. He might have spec ops training and all, but this is supposed to be a survival show, not combat show.It seems to me like he thinks that just beacuse he was Spec ops, he know everything about evrything including survival, which coulnt be farther from the truth. Spec. ops have a limited survival knowledge, they are trained to survive a couple of days, until rescued, Cody actually lives in the wilderness. I think Cody and Dave have a lot more knowledge about surviving in different enviroments that this guy, and frankly his Spec ops cockiness is annoying, I feel like I'm wathing Nutnfancy on YT.",Positive
"British actors do a great job with this unusual alien invasion story.  What is it like?  Well, don't expect state-of-the-art special effects; don't expect elaborate costumes, spaceships, or aliens.  Rather, you will find a delightful British cast who makes the story line work, because you like the characters.The storyline?  It starts with WW-II when a strange craft and ""being"" crash... but very soon we are transported to out current time period and must figure out what happened with the WW-II discovery.  I won't share much more of the detail of the story except to say that aliens have come to invade...both good and bad aliens.Note well: it is a short series, but I was involved in it after the second episode.  The storyline builds from episode to episode, as does the excitement.  For anyone who likes Sci-Fi and also for those who like good acting, this series is worth the watch. It isn't spectacular like ""Falling Skies"" on TNT, but it will pleasantly surprise.  I give it 4 stars.",Positive

"Nothing original here. The boys do science, the girls do fashion. There's the stuck-up blonde girl character, the teacher with fifties eyeglasses, the rough-voice bully, the intrepid person of color, the evil scientist villain.

When he was floating in the air. - per 5 year old.the show was cute, I loved the crab at the beginning, it was very Little Mermaid of his use of the kite and my child was happy to describe the real use for the item.  the show was bright and colorful and a lot of fun to try to help.",Positive
"I enjoyed this TV show and glad I was able to catch up with season 4.  Its a great show and just wanted to see what happened in this season, my best description is wow.",Positive
Watching it on Amazon Prime is even better because you don't have to wait for next week or next season to see the next episode.,Positive

"The Rebels is fast paced,and funny as hell ( Spoiler Alert!! Don't give your pet monkey cocaine and access to firearms.) the lead character Julie played by Natalie Zea inherits a dreadfully bad Football team after her husbands passing. She is in over her head but she is also a fighter who isn't about to be bullied by the good ole boys who run the league. If you are an NFL fan you will love this show. Raunchy , smart, well written shows are rare. Enjoy this show, good ones like this are usually few and far between !",Positive
"The main character very charismatic, gritty and very rough around the edges. I am most intrigued by Copper and look forward to what happens next. Tough guy with a sensitive side, most interesting.",Positive

"The only thing worse than having to watch a movie you never really cared for to begin with is being forced to watch it again and then realizing you can't stand it. That's exactly what happened with first time director Nicholas Jarecki's ""Arbitrage."" Starring Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, Brit Marling, and Tim Roth, ""Arbitrage"" is the story of a billionaire named Robert Miller (Gere). Robert is the manager of a hedge fund empire that is supposedly one of the most profitable in the business, but Robert altered his books and committed fraud. Even though he's covered his tracks, the fraud is still there. On Robert's 60th birthday, a deal that will tie up all the loose ends and keep Robert and his family very happy and wealthy is on the verge of being negotiated. But that's when things begin to get a bit more complicated in Robert's life and his lies begin to get the best of him.""Arbitrage"" was one of the first screeners sent out to critics during the awards season. The movie is getting a ton of buzz because of Richard Gere's performance, so it was thrown into the nearest movie playing device and watched as quickly as possible. Needless to say, it was a huge letdown and was passable at best. So many screeners are sent out to critics every year, but this was the first year that the majority of the pile was watched on this end. So after viewing 30 or 40 movies since its initial viewing, ""Arbitrage"" shows up on Blu-ray in the mail and since the specifics of the movie had become so blurred since the last viewing another one was in order. Its second viewing only makes the experience feel even more mundane.Robert Miller isn't exactly an upstanding citizen. Hell, he isn't even likeable. Robert Miller is only watching out for Robert Miller. He only does what benefits himself. He tries to make it seem like he's worried about his family, but he's honestly just obsessed with money and is afraid of tarnishing his reputation. Richard Gere's performance isn't bad, but it doesn't really deserve a ton of accolades either. He's a guy that's buried himself in his own grave who's now mimicking a cockroach who won't die while scurrying along and trying to find any escape route that he can. Gere mostly just seems to throw temper tantrums and has a few emotional outbursts, but is nothing special overall. He yells a lot, but his go-to method is yelling completely belittling things to whoever he's talking to before whispering that they should come sit next to him so he can show them something. This happens on at least three different occasions with two different individuals.The movie is also a total waste of Tim Roth. Going into this, you may think to yourself that maybe Roth will at least have some enjoyable scenes. That unfortunately isn't really the case. Det. Michael Bryer (Roth) is a cop who plays dirty without actually being a dirty cop, if that makes any sense. He pulls strings to do things that aren't by the book, but it's to put the ones who deserve to be behind bars where they belong. Roth mostly just acts tough without ever doing anything to back it up or possibly never really having the chance. The most enjoyable part of his performance is his handlebar mustache. Brit Marling and Susan Sarandon feel wasted as well, but the wound doesn't feel quite as deep. Marling portrays Robert's daughter Brooke who also works for him while Sarandon is Robert's wife. Marling's only real shining moment is a shouting match with her father in a public park, but the scene only makes you wonder why nobody is stopping or taking notice of the argument even though it gets extremely heated. Sarandon's highlight is acting too busy to talk to Tim Roth even though she doesn't really have much going on, but honestly anything feels like a step up for her after her appearance in ""That's My Boy.""""Arbitrage"" attempts to be this thrilling and compelling piece of cinema and it just isn't. There are several different storylines going on throughout the movie, but it all just feels very ho hum; you don't care about any of it. Robert tries to be portrayed in this light that he's a wolf in sheep's clothing, but he's more of a rat in a skin suit. You have no desire to see his story go one way or the other. Not to mention that he bleeds internally for like a week and barely acknowledges it after the first night. With all of the cheating, the lying, the backstabbing, and innocent people who are trying to turn their life around and yet are getting hurt because of Robert, ""Arbitrage"" is the story of one rich man's downward spiral where both sides lie to try to get what they want but both walk away empty handed. It all results in a standstill that is about as thrilling as a staring contest.Special features on the Blu-ray of the film include Commentary with Writer/Director Nicholas Jarecki, the 12.5 minute ""A Glimpse into Arbitrage"" featurette which features the cast and crew discussing the film, the 7 minute ""Who is Robert Miller?"" featurette, and 10 minutes of Deleted Scenes with Optional Director Commentary.",Negative

"All I have to say is &#34;Why&#34; Amazon.  You take something really good & have good potential of becoming the first show to take over &#34;Dead man Walk&#34; and turn it to a trash.  I really wish they didn't put the nude scenes.  I understand it is not a regular TV, but still I would've liked to be more realistic than someone is scared to death find the time to enjoy a swim naked.",Negative
"""Bluebloods"", about a family of New York policemen, returns for a second strong season with CBS in 2011.  Having vanquished the corrupt and lethal Blue Templars last season, the Reagan family, led by Police Commissioner Frank Reagan (Tom Selleck), will face new challenges on the streets of New York City.  The family includes his daughter Erin (Bridget Moynahan), an assistant district attorney; son Danny, a hard-charging detective; and youngest son Jamie, a new beat cop learning the ropes.  The fine supporting cast includes Len Cariou as Frank's retired policemen father and Jennifer Esposito as Danny's detective partner Jackie Curatola.The show continues to offer a nice balance of crime-of-the-week excitement and family interaction.  Scenes around the Reagan family Sunday dinner table are a key component of the series, in which job squabbles and sibling rivalries get worked out with a little collective wisdom.  Erin will juggle her legal duties with single parenthood of a restless teenager.  Danny will be challenged throughout the season to balance his hardnosed, relentless conduct of his job with the demands of his family, including the fears of wife Linda (Amy Carlson) for his safety.  Jamie, who seems to have a talent for undecover work, will be invited to infiltrate a mob family, at considerable risk.  Frank Reagan will work with a new mayor and will face some gut-wrenching challenges, including the overturning of an old conviction on DNA evidence and an inflammatory racial incident involving a black mosque.""Blue Bloods"" is highly recommended to its fans as a solid, family-oriented police procedural.",Positive
"In its strong third season, NCIS-Los Angeles continues to capitalize on its excellent cast, as the NCIS LA-based Office of Special Projects conducts undercover operations against terrorists, spies, arms-dealers, transnational criminals and other threats to the Department of the Navy.Linda Hunt returns as diminutive and mysterious Operations Manager Hetty Lange, who continues to overawe the agents each week.  The original superb buddy team of Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J as agents G. Callen and Sam Hanna is joined by a second field team, consisting of Agent Kensi Blye (Daniela Ruah) and LAPD detective Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen), who are still working on their often hilarious love-hate relationship.  Computer geeks Eric Beale (Barrett Foa) and Nell Jones (Renee Smith) form a third team.  The mysterious Nell seems to have an additional hush-hush role as cat's paw for Hetty, and will materialize on at least one mission brandishing a firearm with unexpected skill.The season opens with the thrilling conclusion to last season's cliffhanger, which had the team on an unauthorized rescue mission in Romania.  The four field agents will attempt to storm a criminal gang's headquarters to rescue Hetty.  In the process, they will have to cope with the manipulations of secretive acting Operations Manager Lauren Hunter (Claire Forlani in a recurring role), who seems to have her own agenda. The fallout of the mission will include, at long last, some shocking insights into the unknown past of Agent Callen, including unsuspected ties to Hetty.  An extended story arc in mid-season will feature a visitation by a sinster assistant director from headquarters, whose purpose will only slowly be revealed, and it won't be good for the team, especially Kensi.  An extended season-ending cliffhanger matches the team against a clever chess-playing villain (and blast from the past) who leaves the team in desperate disarray.""NCIS: Los Angeles"" is highly recommended to NCIS fans as a lighter and hipper version of the original show.  It offers its own exciting weekly storylines.  Its fun emphasis on character interaction will include Kensi's poorly-hidden jealousy over Deeks' relationship with an attractive female Mexican police officer, Sam's hunt for his missing and highly-prized personal classic car, or Nell tempting Eric to ""break the internet.""",Positive

"This show is great fun.  You get to see historical and unusual and antique objects restored.  Season 2 spends a bit too much time on the cast dynamics.  I wish they'd spend more showing how the actual restorations are done, which is what got us watching Season 1.  In any event, it's one of our go-to shows because it's always satisfying.",Positive
"I like the film and it's expression of similarily grouped people in extraordinary circumstances from &#34;events&#34; of some unknown origin. I would have given the film (or TV series) a higher mark if the series plot had said why they were in the same group linked together through an event (unknown) other than saying they have the same birthday. Weird? Yes, but interesting to see the twists from future series productions.",Positive
"Again, for anyone like myself who likes decent good guys that aren't degraded or broken in some fashion, this is the show to watch!

A local station started reruns of Heroes.  I never watch the beginning of the series when it was on TV.  I got hooked on the reruns and decided I needed to watch it from the beginning.  I got Season one and decided I needed Season Two.  I now have 3 & 4.  I will get 5 & 6 at a later date.,Positive

It was a great beginning with a lot of potential. That the series was not granted more than one season is unfortunate.,Positive
This is a very interesting show.  I like the real-life stories.  Definitely entertaining and I'll be watching more for sure.,Positive
"If you did not see it, this episode totals 50 minutes.  I scanned forward after the credits and ran into a scene with Woolsey and Todd.  But, there is no sound.  I think this may have been cut from the episode and why it is here I do not know.  I just wish it had audio.",Positive
"as one of their own is shot and killed by the terrorist Gibbs has been hunting Ari.  The season also shows how the different NCIS members are dealing with this tragic loss in a two part episode Kill Ari.  This in turn leads to the new characters, Ziva David and the new NCIS Director (who has more than a little history with Gibbs).This all blends in well and the new members of the team pick up right where they left off.  With all the quirkiness and fun that they have in each show, it only helps to show much the actors/actresses have grown together and it makes NCIS one reason that i love to watch not only this show.  But others of the same caliber.  I am looking forward to season four as well as the 3rd season ended in a particular way.  It leaves a lot of things open for the following season.But it also answers a few questions before the season is up like Gibbs past and how that affects him in his job today.  I love all the characters in the show-Abby, Ducky, Dinozo(sp), ""Probie"", Ziva and the like.  As each of them has their various moments throughout the season from killing an undercover cop, to a prisoner dying in custody or a mentally deranged ex-boyfriend that just won't go away.Along with some cool special features, NCIS is a show that is best watched from the beginning so that you get the full effect.  So buy the 1st seasons and start from there.  By the time you get to season 3 you'll be well versed and know what all the buzz is about.  NCIS is the real deal when it comes to TV shows period.",Positive

"CUTIE AND THE BOXER is a no-holds barred documentary focusing on the 40-year marriage of Ushio Shinohara and his wife Noriko.  Ushio established his reputation in Japan as a leading avant-garde artist before emigrating to the United States; since his marriage in the early Seventies, it's clear he has assumed a dominant role as artist and alcoholic, seldom taking much notice of his wife, also an artist.  Zachary Heinzerling's film shows how Noriko carved out a niche for herself by creating designs for herself, focusing on a character called Cutie and her struggles for self-determination.  The subjects of such designs are very closely related to Noriko's own life; it's clear she has experienced a difficult time trying to put up with a difficult husband - who throughout his life has found it hard to make a living through his art - and a son who drinks too much.  It's a tribute to her stoicism that she not only manages to retain her artistic voice, but creates designs of her own that satirize her husband.  Ushio, by now a reformed alcoholic, views his wife's paintings indulgently; they don't represent a threat to his masculinity, nor his status as an artist.  In truth Noriko's designs are far more expressive than her husband's - although Ushio claims to produce material that will show a &#34;new&#34; artist, he only ever produces copies of work created several decades previously.  Director Heinzerling makes no judgment on either of the protagonists, but leaves us to make up our own minds,  What is perhaps most admirable is the way the couple have stayed together through thick and thin - despite their differences, they are obviously still in love with one another.",Positive
"The characters seem to be stereotypical and there are too many of them. The premise of the show seems good but it's very unclear and unfocused. There are weird creatures, mass amnesia, loud sounds that break glass once in a while, selective power outages, strangely locked doors, and an unclear timeline. If there was more orginization instead of the producers trying to throw every scenario into a 50 minute time frame, the show would be successful.",Negative

I bought this series to bring me up to date  as I've started the latest shows on TV & realized it is in a second season!  I enjoy the shows as I can compare the police procedures between Canada & USA .  Home come our US cops are always shooting & banging people around??  I like the format for showing Victim & Killer in the beginning & then putting the puzzle together to show how these seemingly random people end up committing a crime.  Another study in the strange workings of the human mind.,Positive

I decided to watch this after a friend recommended. And I really liked it a lot. I love the girl from American Horror Story she is such a great actress. It was great to see her on something more than that tv show. The movie was well done. I didn't get bored like I usually do. It was very entertaining and definitely worth the watch.,Positive
"Vera is totally unique.  She is unlike any British detective past or present.  She wears unfashionable clothing, her hair is always a mess, she uses the word &#34;pet&#34;  when speaking to everyone, suspects, victims and subordinates.  She has fits of temper.  However, she solves cases brilliantly.  Watch this, you will enjoy it.",Positive
"One of the hallmarks of the first two seasons of ""Friday Night Lights"" was the show's ability to really use its ensemble cast to the fullest.  Each week would shine the spotlight on a different character scenario or two, and if those weren't the ones that appealed to you...well, you knew that the next week it would be something different.  While this third season does a good job of moving certain storylines forward, it also turns rather repetitive at times in terms of the areas it really focuses in on.For a basic summary, Season Three is one in which we (as viewers) say goodbye to some established figures and welcome some ""new blood"" into the fold.  Because the writers strike of 2007 completely screwed over Season Two's ""ending"", the beginning episodes of this year basically just get us back up to speed.  From there, a few things given to us in this installment include:-Mrs. Taylor's new role as school principle and the new perspective it gives her on certain issues.-The continued evolution of the Tyra/Landry & Tim/Lyla relationships.-Jason Street doing everything he can to provide for his new ""family""-The ongoing foibles of Buddy Garrity.-A new QB threat to Matt Ceracen.There are some parts of Season Three that work very well.  The chemistry within the Taylor family is still the backbone of the show, and it still never fails to produce emotion in nearly every episode.  The ""new QB in town"" angle is also probably the strongest one of the entire season.  Tami's new turn as school principle also brings up some moral dilemmas that prove quite interesting.The trouble with this season, though, is that all the other angles fall under the following two categories: Either they are done too quickly (Smash Williams, Jason Street), or they linger on for far too long (Tyra's rebellious streak, the ticking time bomb that is Tim Riggins).  More specifically, the characters of Tyra & Tim (who really stood out in the Second Season) are given more screen time but less character development in the sense that they don't seem much different from beginning to end.  It is probably a case of the writers knowing that such drama works with most viewers and being a bit scared (in the wake of cancellation) to stray too far from the formula.Overall, then, I can't rate Season Three of ""Friday Night Lights"" nearly as well as its two predecessors.  Whereas those earlier seasons were high drama with pockets of repetition, I felt that the formula was flipped in this case.  The ending of the season set up a scenario that looks like it has great potential to produce an entertaining fourth season, so I'm not giving up hope just yet.  I'm just a bit concerned that the show has ""slipped"" a bit with each subsequent season so far.",Negative
This feels like a different take on a mix between Entourage and How to make it in America. Topic is right on point for the times and it's funny and has a real good plot.The cliffhanger at the end is scary as it almost feels like the creators don't know where they are taking this show themselves. So I hope they do and I hope they maintain the quality!,Positive
Great for background noise. keeps you interested and entertained yet you do not have to sit and watch the whole thing.,Positive
Plot twists never end! I really like Scott Foley -- his character is developing well. I keep hoping for Huck to find his way out of his trauma and the most recent episode gives me hope that his strength and intelligence will carry him to victory. This is such a fun series -- good to watch episodes a second time to catch nuances. I have never been so hooked on a TV series.,Positive
"It has some language and sexual situations, but the fact that they point out that some of their behavior is wrong is refreshing.  The story line is interesting and keeps your interest which, in my opinion, is rare these days.",Positive
"I loved the ending and it alone makes me want to see the next episode.  However, that's the only thing that's really new about this.  It's a different portrayal of apocalyptic creatures.  Other than that, this story has been told over and over again.  It looks like different people, different title, same story.  I'd have to see something more that's different in order to stay interested.",Negative
This show is really smart and entertaining.  I enjoy the characters and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys police procedurals.,Positive
"This show never fails to entertain me. I'm just a little disappointed in some of the characters this year, but not enough to stop watching. This is one of the few shows I'll pay to download to my kindle fire.",Positive
"You know, with each season, it keeps getting better. Mystery, time travel, mayhem, chaos, and less we forget, lots of running around. Sonic screwdrivers aside, if you haven't watched any of these episodes, then you are truly missing out on some of the best weekly sci-fi that is currently out there. Yes, I know, it's BBC but come on, they have managed to carve a clever corner of the market on good programming and I don't miss a single episode.So in closing, watch this show, but not while your eating anything, so that if you gasp or laugh, you don't choke. Because you'll do that a lot. I know, it's happened to me.",Positive
"Here we have a series with an interested premise and a few standout characters that flops because of low budget and/or bland writing.  Never a lot of urgency.  Never a lot of cool encounters with new and weird &#34;Alphas.&#34;  Never a building of tension that drives you to catch the next episode.  Which is a shame, because there are a few very skilled actors in this series.  It could have evolved into a very imaginative, action-packed series.This is a tame show that is more of a Marvel Extra-Lite or Diet DC (0 Calories) than its own spectacular take on superhumans invading/integrating into society.  If you enjoy stories about superhumans, you are much better off reading some of the excellent anthologies or graphic novels out there now.  Or, of course, just wait for the big budget Marvel and DC movies.LOOKING FOR GOOD SUPERHUMAN STORIES?Check out George R. R. Martins' Wild Cards series, anthologies like The Mutant Files (edited by Greenberg), graphic novels like Preacher, The Sandman, Garth Ennis' Punisher Max series, The Punisher: Franken-Castle, Marvel Universe vs. The Punisher, etc.On TV, check out Penny Dreadful.",Negative
"This series is surprisingly good since the premise and the characters could easily make it simply formulaic. Here's my one criticism: if you're going to write a crime series which supposedly takes place in SE Florida given the constant reference to the Everglades, try checking a map and a few facts now and then. Too many sloppy references to cities on the west coast of FL as if they are right next door. Also, the episode about the hurricane is ludicrous. A high school reunion during a hurricane? A category 2 storm causing the type of wind damage portrayed?  Fact checking helps with credibility.",Positive
Very good. Can't go wrong watching this. I recommand this to everyone. I love parking wars because it's different.,Positive

"I have never before (and will never again...probably) seen a show as delightful as this.  NYC has been integrated.  Demons, zombies, werewolves, robots, koala men, kongs (as in King Kong) and a never-ending parade of weirdos, misfits, and unidentifiable creatures all live together in peace and harmony.  Well, not so much peace and harmony, but they would if Mark Lily had anything to say about it.The show follows the rather inept - albeit good-intentioned - social worker as he tries to make a life for himself while doing his best to help the underprivileged & mentally, er..., &#34;special&#34; newcomers integrate into the wild city.  The antics the viewer is privy to already make the show a fantastic piece of work.  But what gives the viewer that sort of giddy feeling when they watch is the fact that the artists and animators have crammed every frame with sight gags.  From wacky posters, to the most random, off-the-wall, background characters/scenes, to easter eggs that reference past episodes, there isn't a single frame that doesn't convey just how creative (or crazy?) the people involved with this show were.It's a shame this work of art received only two seasons, but they're both superb and worth watching again and again and again...",Positive

"By putting on former contestants who have already been through the wringer, the show is narrowed to a more able group of designers.  Those who show up here have already passed the crucible of being able to design and sew a high fashion garment.  Where they fall down, which is where any designer does fall down, is when their personal taste interferes with their design sense, or a design idea goes hideously wrong.  This is a universal to anyone who does any creative act.  Every creative person creates some real stinkeroos and you're never even quite sure how it happened. We've eliminated a good many contestants already and so far I see Anthony Ryan and Emilio as the two standouts.  I think Anthony Ryan is more consistent than Emilio is but when Emilio hits, he hits big. You will really see some great fashion creating in this season with these two. My next choice would be Uli who I just saw do a bang up job on unisex fashion.  These three have all grown enormously since they appeared on the regular PR.I like these judges as much as I do the PR judges.  I think they do the same basic job and there have been some really great guest judges on the All Stars version.  The judges on All Stars seem to be primarily designers, which I prefer to using actresses as guest judges which PR often does.Some watchers miss Tim Gunn being in the workroom.  His job is taken here by a woman.  The difference is that she is a great deal cooler and less personal with the designers than Gunn is. Gunn actually becomes quite emotionally attached to the designers and invested in their results.  This woman does not do that.  I am not sure which method I prefer.  His method makes for better tv but her method of professionally critiquing what is going on with their garment, and nothing else, is probably very close to the real life studio environment of working in the fashion industry.The model hostess is another good looking blonde like Klum. I don't really find any radical differences between them.  These models are primarily familiar with wearing fashion design. Although this is important, it is not as important as feedback from key designer talent.",Positive

"Stephen Amell seems like he'd be a good guy to have a beer with, but he doesn't project much of anything else on the screen. No anger, no outrage, no affection, no enthusiasm, just ""I'm a nice guy"". That's still leagues better than what everyone projects, which is angst and fecklessness. It's hard to care about any of them.A few of the story lines are pretty good, others rather stupid, even if you accept the premise of a comic book world. The screen writers apparently feel a need to end each episode with a syrupy moral lesson, each of which is forgotten by the start of the next show; it wouldn't do to have the characters change and grow.I'd be surprised if the series lasted more than the first season.",Negative
"Backyardigans is a very innocent show for young children.  It lacks the subtle double entendre of some cartoons but it's good to have a resource that is just nice.  It is more than suitable for my littler guys and I never feel a need to monitor their viewing or censor any of it.  But the best part is the music.  I've never really thought of children's fare in terms of the music before but this shows what can be done in the right hands.  Perhaps it isn't for everyone, but my kids really enjoy singing along.  Bang up job, guys!",Positive
This is a really good series.  Interesting plot twists.  Really look forward to each new episode.  One of those rare series in which I like the #1 bad guy as much as the #1 good guy.,Positive
The first shows had too much sound going on and no closed captioning. It was hard to follow. Later they stopped playing music and conversation in the background besides what they were saying. It got easier to understand. Didn't have a rapport yet with the actors.,Positive
This show gets better and better. Each season I am amazed at the quality of writing and acting. This season does not disappoint. If I could recommend just two shows they would be The Walking Dead and Justified.,Positive
"Roy looks like a mountain man.  He's earned a bunch of patents, but his property in the Redwoods has all kinds of beat up cars on it.  He's accrued 20 MILLION in local fees.  Now clearly no one would be able to pay that.  ""Hoarders"" tries to clear his cars and their equipment gets stuck in the mud!  If this guy is such the genius, why doesn't he have a lab, rather than a heap of junk!?  The show never says if his hoarding hurt the redwoods or was in some way anti-green.Now Loretta was a trip!  She looked like Marla Gibbs on crack!  She was pregnant and the show concludes by saying she had a healthy baby girl.  Still, I'm seriously worried that the mother's nuttiness may hurt the child eventually.  Loretta didn't wanna throw away nothin'!  It was funny, and exhilarating, to see her sistah-gurl relative snap on her and walk off in disgust.  Her husband stood by her side, regardless.  He must have loved her strong, or just had extreme passive tendencies.  Many of the non-hoarding husbands on this show threaten to leave, but this guy never once indicates that he'd abandon his nutty wife.  Good for him, well, in a way!",Negative

Another show where good is pitted against evil.  In this case the big corporation heads who have only personal agendas with no compassion for their underlings.

Really!!!Even though the opening of the show, shows them at a local lake hunting ducks...with their duck calls.If they want to test their calls, why not just go to the lake? Instead they flood their loading dock, with a hose. That had to take a couple of days easily.Dumb show.",Negative
"I encourage the creators (Matt Shumway and Company)  to continue creating Sci-Fi movies. This Sci-Fi movie had a lot of potential and for an independent film; ""excellent"" set design and good use special effects!However, the ""acting"" delivery of the lines could of been better. It sounded like they were speaking from the script. As an professional actress (who has worked for independent film makers in the San Fran / Bay Area); I can tell by their line delivery.I think there needs to be more rehearsal time and work allowing actors to ""be in the moment"". The quality of the acting could of been a whole lot better. A lot of film makers/ directors totally do not get that.The story writing was ""ok"" but not sure if the intention was to ""cheese out"" towards the end. Also the VIP prisoner ""fight scenes"" did not make sense. If she was that dangerous, she would kill, not think, and move toward her next agenda. So those fight scenes felt empty.The story also seemed rushed. Nothing more captivating than, allowing the audience ""to be in the moment"" considering the films set design supported it.Sci-Fi if done well is one of the most difficult and rewarding art forms an film artist can accomplish. Like Horror; it is also one of the most difficult genres to be successful in.Sci-Fi is one of the most highly desired genres that people seek to watch and if you have the set design then take advantage of the ""environment"" that you have created. Sci-Fi is about tomorrow and the unknown. Its not about being scary; it about humanity and non-humanity in the future.This movie didn't give us any of that. It was a rushed story with no background for us to hold on too.If you look at ""high budget"" TV shows like Stargate SG-1. You will notice that this movie (Enigma) had a great ""Sci-Fi set design"" to work with (similar to big budget Sci-Fi TV shows) and a decent baseline story to work with.Low-budget does NOT = rushing the storyline or trying to finish the film in one day.For the next film you guys make: Please allow actors to fully understand the scene and the environment in which they are working in and also....please put more energy into the ""story"" itself.Lots of promise for you guys to hit it big on the SyFy network one day!!",Negative
"The 10th anniversary season ofProject Runway: The Complete Eighth Seasonopens in Times Square with Heidi Klum, Tim Gunn, Nina Garcia, and Michael Kors. The competing designers bring their own outfits, and they are tasked with making another design for the Tomes Square catwalk. It's a creative concept and it works. It's a relief to see Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn back after their absence in Project Runway All-Stars. It was great to see Mondo Guerra's win in Project Runway All-Stars... but the absence of Heidi&Tim;, there was a void. Luckily, Heidi&Tim; are back for the new flock of contestants. The contestants talk about the worldviews behind their designs. Dimitri is very precise; Buffi is into wildness&animal; prints; Van is into elegance. It's a great comeback!",Positive
the movie was about monsters that are foreign to us and how the governments  and people decide to react to the situation,Negative
"I am going to continue with my request that amazon not require comments in order to rate something! I can understand why you would like products rated and I do read reviews when considering a purchase, but not when watching tv or movies! I pretty much look at the stars only!",Positive
This is one of the best quality shows on TV.  I really truly cannot wait for next season to start,Positive
This show certainly has potential.  I hope that the CW will renew it for next season!  It's got some really good up-and-coming actors.  I'm anxious to see where this show will take us.,Positive
Do sad they stopped production at 2 seasons.  The producers had finally taken the corny and juvenile schlock our of the Star Gate franchise and given us an Adult Show with complex chatacters and then...  And then...  Some doofus pulled the plug!  So sad!  My wife and I really enjoyed binge streaming Sg-U for the second time.  Very enjoyable characters and story line - though rescuing Chloe gets tedious!!!  The other characters remained engaging.  Sorry it ended so abruptly!,Positive
"I had seen several of the later episodes when they aired, but was a bit confused in a few places as to how, when and where. After purchasing Seasons 1 and 2, the blanks are filled in, and while I have found some episodes sort of ordinary, others make it well worth while to watch.The presise isn't new - not matter who or what we are (or look like) we deserve conpassion, but it's taken over the top, and pushes that point. A bit quirky, especially with a reformed Jack the Ripper, and Tesla popping in and, but totally enjoyable.If you like fantasy served up as possiblity, you'll love the series.",Positive
"I want to preface this by saying I am a HUGE WH13 fan. I love everything about it from the cheesy jokes to the awesome purple goo. This season is no exception. I was worried and nervous about what direction the show was going to take coming out of season 3. Although I personally would have gone a different direction, I was pleasantly surprised by what they did with the show this season. There was a lot of suspense and intrigue. It's sad that season 5 is the last season, but hopefully they will tie up all the loose ends nicely.",Positive
"With the impending death of network television (as we know it), all too many great shows have been canceled.  The shocking lack of intelligent and engaging shows is sad.  Small wonder a great many viewers rarely watch network television, choosing instead to view programming via the internet.That said, it's wonderful that high quality shows such as Blue Bloods are still available to discerning viewers via network television AND internet viewing.",Positive
"We can only hope Amazon picks up this series as it appears to have A LOT of potential to be GREAT!!!!! The pilot hooks you within the first fifteen minutes. The actors are excellent and a few faces you'll recognize from Heroes and NY PD Blue (to name two). Amazon is showing a lot of promise in their series development, but now its time to see if they follow through and actually make a series out of any of them.",Positive
"""When you take him down you take him down hard and I'll make sure the whole world is watching."" Max Lewinsky (McAvoy) is a detective who is good at what he does. When he finally gets the chance to stop Jacob Sternwood (Strong), the man he has been looking for, he ends up getting shot and Jacob gets away. Three years later Jacob's son winds up in the hospital and Max again sees a chance to take him down but the closer he gets to Jacob the more truths he begins to uncover. I have been a fan of the British crime dramas for awhile now. I was looking forward to seeing this one. This one isn't too bad but I have seen others that I have liked more. The acting is great and the story keeps you involved and interested to see what is going to happen. There are enough twists in the movie to keep you guessing. It does seem a little slow in some parts but for the most part this is a good movie and if you are a fan of the genre then you will enjoy this one as well. Overall, a movie I enjoyed being a fan of this type of movie. I give it a B.",Negative
"I can't say enough about the Walking Dead show.  It is new, well-written, and completely different from anything already on TV.  I am completely hooked.  I felt it was worth it to buy the third season so I could watch it while waiting for the new season to debut.  The product itself was fine and I am very satisfied.",Positive
"Totally stupid show . Spencer is a talentless actor , Kinney has the acting ability and personality of a brick wall , the rest of the cast is wooden and as for the stories , oh yeah there are none . Brain dead series for a brain dead audience .",Negative
"I enjoyed season two.  Shocking end, but very well done.  I used to think only here in the USA that we had gangs, illegal guns, terrorists and good old fashion poverty, but this series is set in Toronto and shows human nature at its most vulnerable and that these human condition exist everywhere to one degree or another.The characters are very likable.  You see just enough of their private lives to be interesting and engage your interest without overwhelming the show.  Enrico Colantoni, is a spectacular actor and never disappoints no matter the role.  I have seen him in Veronica Mars, Just Shoot Me, and most recently in Person of Interest.  He is able to adapt to a role and make it believable.  Hugh Dillon is wonderful and David Paetkau is just plain HOT!  Where's the fan?  :)This is a police procedural with all the trimmings and well worth watching.",Positive
"I feel like it's a show you would find on Adult Swim.  Not exactly my style.  It's not that creative, and somewhat predictable.  Things kind of just drag on too.",Negative
"Great pilot episode.  The writers have done a brilliant job striking a balance between ruthless business, romance, and the daily grind of life.  I eagerly await the next installment.  Quote of the day: ""I would never say damp; it makes my vag sound like the Dagobah system."" - I practically peed myself I was laughing so hard.",Positive
"Johnny Lee Miller's portrayal is so endearing: his Sherlock is damaged and quirky, without the overpowering condescension we seen in the British TV version. The storyline is genius: Watson = female sober-companion, and subtly played by Lucy Liu - whose character has her own damage-stuff going in. The cases are interesting. Aiden Quinn is lovely in his role - he always brings such gravitas. It's a GREAT show.",Positive
"My issue with this series and for the &#34;Onion News&#34; in general is that they believe that crass humor is the way to go in their fake reporting. While people do seem to like some of this I do not. I find it offensive for the most part. When a company thinks it is okay to attack a young child that is up for an Oscar you start to question their taste level. This show made me question it further. What could have been a rather interesting &#34;News Show&#34; pilot falls flat because of its attachment to the Onion News. I enjoy the actors in other shows and even enjoyed the introduction of the segment producer that I hadn't seen anywhere else to date, but this is not the show for them to find their next move in the business because simply put it is a horrible show about horrible people. There was simply nothing redeeming for this show because of how crude and crass it decided to be.",Negative
An interesting look at the forces of Nature and how they are constantly reshaping our planet. A well done documentary.,Positive
"We have been glued to every episode of every season.  The show is so well written and acted, with amazing sets.",Positive
This show was a nice surprise. The story lines are interesting and the characters and story have depth. Very interesting,Positive
"Excellent presentation of the story of a developing Las Vegas and the players that shaped the city. The acting, costuming, sets, plots, scripts and casting are all top notch. Highly recommended.",Positive
the series has a complex storyline great characters good acting addictive fast moving why does amazon require such long reviews,Positive
"I was concerned with what direction this show would go after Red John, but it is holding up extremely well to a difficult transition.  Still fantastic writing and acting!",Positive
I have ordered all the seasons of NCIS so far and have had no problems with any of the DVDs. All have come fast and when they said they would come.,Positive
"This is based on the movie Legion, and I am just not getting it.  The instructions have finally transferred to Alex from Jeep.  Jeep has never learned to read the instructions, and he also hasn't found the prophets.The show has started out slow with Alex, the chosen one, living in Vega (Vegas anyone?  What is up with the stupid name change?) under a feudal type of system.  They have all heard of the Chosen One, but no one was aware that Alex was that person.  And once they learn the identity of the chosen one, they really don't care.  Chosen for what?The show is slow.  Even the actors appear to be slow.  Alex has a love promised to another.  The feudal lords are always trying to figure out how they can become king.  There is treachery.  There is a secret group with one of the children of the ruling families who heads it that is secretly helping Gabriel to defeat humans.  I can't even figure out how that makes sense.  I watched three shows, and I am still waiting for something beyond petty human bickering and angel angst.",Negative
Plot got muddled as I recall. Not memorable.  Forgot why I watched it. I don't think I watched it all the way through.,Negative
"I find little growth in the characters--each one continues to act in the roles they initially played:  Harvey tough and always right, Mike bright and insubordinate, the character played by Rick Hoffman predictably despicable with some redeeming qualities.  The red-haired secretary is always sarcastic--it's hard to see who she really is as a genuine person with a gamut of emotions.I'd like to see change and development in the characters.  I want to be more moved by the stories.",Negative
"Grey's anatomy is a well known &#34;medical drama&#34; having made it to its 9th season at this point. That said, the only updates it seems to have received in the last 8 years are that it has moved further from &#34;medical&#34; and far more into plain &#34;drama.&#34;Grey's has moved further and further away from the actual medicine. These days almost every episode is about the drama of the main characters themselves and their personal lives. While that has always been a theme, it always took place within the greater backdrop of the hospital. By the time we hit Season 9, the setting of the show almost doesn't matter. These could be workers at a Starbucks and the basics of the show would be the same.The problem here is that so much drama has happened to these characters at this point that it is hard to feel any connection to them anymore. There's hardly a doctor among them who hasn't been stabbed, shot, died, brought back to life, married, divorced, remarried, re-divorced, sued, pregnant, leaving, returning, etc. There's only so much that can happen to one character before you just become disconnected from the whole thing.If you're a fan of the series, this season  is probably worth watching. If you're iffy on the whole theme to begin with, it might be time to just say enough is enough and find something fresh.",Negative
"Do No Harm is an inventive update of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story.  The medical drama is satisfying, and the science is fascinating.  The romantic tensions in the script are delicious, especially between Dr. Jason Cole (the main character) and Dr. Lena Solis, played by the lovely and talented Alana De La Garza.  Dr. Cole's Dr. Hyde alter ego, Ian, is an edgy and believable bad boy.  Ruta Gedmintas is the simmering hot, yet vulnerable, girlfriend -- primarily of the alter ego character.  Though not totally original, this show is surprisingly good and good fun.",Positive
"I watched this and thought it would be funny, but most of the recycled jokes and lack of any truly funny moments made it boring.",Negative
"I like the show, it forecasts a kind of apocalyptic future if electricity is turned off. But it eventually evolved into something different - a kind of fantasy with fairies and other stuff. I lost interest in it and got busy so I missed the last season.",Positive
It took me some time to get used to the mix of modern day and early Times. But it was a great idea. I enjoyed every episode and would recommend this series. There was few slow moments but it kept my interest had it not then I wouldn't have purchased or watched all the parts.,Positive
"The overall premise is well a bit out there but overall the episode is entertaining.  The lead characters were funny and the banter between them was a definite win - however the overall plot seemed a bit short sighted. Obviously, the show is going to focus on the two ladies and their experiences. However, I felt they needed more development or back-story to make you really want to care for them in the long haul.  Humorous=yes, entertaining=yes, potential=yes.  Let's see where it goes from here.",Negative
"I really enjoyed this.  It's well-made, it builds all the way to the end.  I didn't so much care about the characters, but it's a story told quite well.  Gritty and realistic look is nice.  The girlfriend wasn't into it at all, but I liked it.",Positive
"Sorta pokes fun at horror movies while keeping a story line while taking one on an external acid trip and teaching you what it can be like, with twists and all.  Just good fun.",Positive
"This is absolutely SciFi at its best. Good actors, good story line! Can't wait until the next season comes out!",Positive
"Well written show, great actors. The subject matter is very deep & makes you think. Eric McCormack is excellent in this role. I don't think they had to add Scott Wolfe to the mix & push him in our face this season. Even though I like Scott as an actor, Perception doesn't need him. It's just fine without him.",Positive
I would watch it again. Funny moments that crack you up.,Positive
I've been looking for a good standup comedian that knows how to deliver real laughs without making me cringe or change the channel for fear that someone (my grand kids) would see me laugh at crude humor.,Negative
"While I'm a David Tennant fan (Doctor Who #10!), I am also an Alan Furst fan, and I was surprised to see Tennant cast in the lead role here.  Tennant is a fine actor but seems a bit young and insubstantial as a French spymaster here.  Still, the story is well adapted, and one gets used to Tennant in the role.  The episodes are exciting and do a good job of conveying both the history and the feeling of Furst's novel.",Positive
Still a great show and ending on a high note but Tina Fey called it right. It was time to go.,Positive
Am so ready for season 7 wish it was not the final one,Positive
This show highlights the increasing surveillance culture we are living with. It is chilling to realize how many of the surveillance features predicted by the show are now commonplace.,Positive
As this was the last season of the series I was expecting the writing to be a lower caliber than the rest of the seasons. it was not. I liked the way they wraped it up.,Positive
"My little one loves the Wonder Pets, especially Ming Ming (she steals the show...and she knows it). I do wish there were more than three seasons, though.",Positive
"Season two is great. I hate the opening credits, seems kind of cheesy to me. The shows are great though and the mysteries they are trying to solve are always exciting.",Positive
I like the premise of this show but I think that it didn't move at an even pace.  The end of the pilot episode was quite captivating making Bosch more human.  I would watch it but I'm not intrigued to know what happens to any of the characters in the show. It could be great though.  It's hard to judge a show by only one episode.,Negative
The most consistently entertaining series I've seen. Love the cast and the story lines . Witty dialog funny situations. I've seen all 4 seasons and am waiting for the 5th.,Positive
"This episode was very enjoyable.  It has all the &#34;usual suspect&#34; bad guys, it ties up old plot lines and has action as well as humor.  I know some have blasted this online, but my family enjoyed it very much.  Sad to see Matt Smith go, but then I was sad to see David Tennant go.  Was not a huge fan of the 9th doctor.  Regeneration sequence is very interesting this time!  I would buy it again.  Look for the surprise cameo at the end - very touching!",Positive

"Well, basics;  Main character was a &#34;mentalist&#34; going around pretending to have psychic powers.Managed to royally torque off a serial killer (Red John), who then proceeded to kill off the main guy (Patrick Jane aka Simon Baker's) Wife and daughter...  Because basically Red John was just that mean.Jane then goes on to join a police department as a consultant and for years they've danced around who / what Red John is / was.It's been entertaining, a goodly amount of humor, some reasonably intelligent plots, good characterization and interactions.Well, this season they close out the Red John plot line and came up with a way for Jane to continue.Had wondered if they could pull it off or not, but so far the plots continue to be entertaining, though you have to wonder at a person with Jane's purported intelligence working for a bunch of (technical term) douche bags that comprise the FBI.Some of the plots are starting to get a bit thin;  One episode, a guy (off screen, most violence that occurs is off-screen or tastefully handled) is chopped to pieces on top of a building and planted in some potted ferns....  So, where was all the blood?  and seriously  do they have any idea of how hard it is to break down a substantial mass of &#34;meat and bone&#34;?Anyway, turn off about 1/2 your logic circuits, go in for the character interactions and reasonably intriguing plot lines.  Worth a look see.A lot more could be said, but not without giving away major plot spoilers...",Positive

"I really likes Aldis Hodge in Leverage and when I saw that he was starring in this show, I had to watch. We all love this show, and I hope the next show(s) will be coming soon.",Positive
"If you are very new to the topics you may enjoy this series. And although there are some tiny portions of genuinely new and informative content, it is too little and too infrequent. It is frustratingly condescending and even silly at times for those who are familiar with the topics. None of the episodes are worth watching for veterans of these sorts of documentaries except perhaps the ""Is there a God"" episode.The ""Is there a God"" episode is surprisingly less condescending. The vocabulary is not dumbed down at all and the there are only a couple silly sidebar explanatory analogies. But the approach to the topic is brazenly insensitive, arrogant and potentially offensive to just about anyone who adheres to a religious Faith.From that episode, it looks like Stephen Hawking has chosen to join the ""there is no god"" crowd.",Negative
"I am a big Law & Order Fan, loved the connection of Bobby * Emmes , and the other role players that followed. Jeff Goldblum , a few Captain changes but the strong writing and Dick Wolf who is still going strong with a new series based on real DA's . I was sad to see the CI series end , SVU still in production with major role changes and lets not forget the original 20 seasons of Law & Order which is my next purchase. Great to have in your library. You can watch them over and over a catch something you missed. Well Done great that Amazon has them available.",Positive
"V/H/S 2 (or S-V/H/S) is the sequel to the horror anthology last year, and damn if it still isn't one of the most entertaining horror movies to come out in recent years. The structure is identical to the original where some people break into a house and find a bunch of VHS tapes, with some more mythology added on to the overarching story without explaining much. The shorts themselves are one-less then the last one. So how are the shorts overall? Well, none of them were really scary, instead they're more just fun and creepy at times. Also the tapes themselves are all basically average instead of the wild variety of quality from the original. So while there's no short on here as good as Amateur Night, there's none as boring/terrible as Second Honeymoon. Let's go over them, worst to best:Slumber Party Alien Abduction - While the kids were good at playing kids (and not dumb horror kids that quietly stare at the camera) and the set-up was fun, the actual alien payoff was overall disappointing. Maybe it's because grey aliens aren't automatically spooky for me but after the aliens are there the aftermath is run/hide/run/hide, and the camera simultaneously shows too much of the aliens while showing too little with the atmosphere. Could've been much better if the camera followed the kids up into the saucer or something. However the CPR scene was pretty damn creepy.A Ride in the Park - A guy with a camera on his helmet goes for a bike ride and runs into the living dead or something. The zombies were pretty well designed and it had an interesting twist on the genre by showing a first person perspective of a zombie. Also like Slumber Party Alien Abduction, there could've been more. Instead the short ends after the zombie gets a call from his girlfriend and kills himself, or something cheesy like that. However one thing that caught me by surprise was that this segment was pretty funny at times, and I don't think it took itself too seriously with some of the stuff.Phase 1 Clinical Trials - Basically the Sixth Sense on camera. A guy gets an experimental eye-camera put in his head where he can see dead people around his house. The premise was pretty creepy and some of the designs were unsettling, I liked this one more than the other two since it was pretty spooky in parts. The main actor had some pretty funny reactions to the stuff going on and the girl had an interesting yet impractical method of avoiding the ghosts.Safe Haven - The craziest of the segments by far, similar to the orignal's 10/31/98 where insane stuff happens on camera. In this one a crew of cameramen go to a cult in Indonesia where the leader promises the usual shangri-la stuff. The cameramen are pretty weirded out and try to extort some dirty secrets about the place, until the time comes for the cult to claim absolution. When that happens the entire compound turns into a suicide-cult, and that might be a weird enough place to end the segment, but the director goes above and beyond afterwards, where the aftermath is straight crazy. This segment has been a bit over-hyped by people but still, Safe Haven delivered on the goods.So all in all, V/H/S 2 was a consistent ride of average segments, none too terrible, and none really amazing. Maybe I've been spoiled by Amateur Night though and was going into this expecting more horror than anything, but for what it is, V/H/S 2 is still a hell of a fun time to watch.",Negative
"I watched this show with my daughter who is 7. She was struck with the idea of being able to wish anything into being. I love that there was dialogue between the characters on 'choices', which is something I'm am always talking about with my daughter, i.e., every second she can make a choice, from what to wear to how to respond to someone who is unkind or rude. She can't wait to see the next episode.",Positive
Debated between 3 and 4 stars. This could be quite good if they don't try too hard to be edgy at the expense of being genuinely funny.,Negative
"I really had to work at the number of times I had to 'suspend disbelief'. I wanted answers as to how Carroll's followers managed to afford sophisticated technology, a helicopter, weaponry, and a huge mansion stocked with enough liquor and food for about 100 people. I also wanted to know where all these followers who came pouring out of the mansion at Joe's arrival, conveniently disappeared to at other times; there only ever seemed to be a handful around at any given time. On a separate note, as others have noted, while I could see the followers pulling one over on the FBI once...no way I can buy them so effortlessly doing it time and time again. This is all just the tip of the iceberg, of course. Having said that though, I was a huge fan of &#34;Lost&#34;, where I had to take 'suspension of disbelief' to a whole new level...but absolutely loved the show.This show is a wild ride, and while much more gory than it needs to be (one of most terrifying movies I've ever seen is Halloween, which had very little gore at all), it had me on the edge of my seat continually. James Purefoy is the star of the show; he has incredible magnetism, and is 'quietly' evil. He didn't rage all the time, and was mainly rather soft spoken, so when he *would* engage in a blood thirsty act...it rocks you back on your heels. It's not hard to believe how one horribly evil man can profoundly influence so very many, as history has shown us time and time again. It's this fact that actually creeps me out the most, in watching this show unfold.",Positive

"funny thing. My brother's been trying to get me to watch this show forever. As it turns out, I get the videos of the day, everyday, and one was Charlie Day giving the commencement speech at his alma mater, Merrimack college in New Hampshire. it was then I realized that its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, was his show, and he's from New Hampshire where I'm from also.of course, this is what prompted me to actually start watching the show. I really enjoy it, it almost seems unscripted. The best part is, it's on Amazon Prime for free. How can you beat that!",Positive
I enjoy the mindlessness of watching this show.  The charactors are funny and the stories of the items brought in are interesting.  I always learn some things new and am suprised by what's valueable.,Positive
"One of the most precious atributes that distinguishes us from any other species is our ability to empathize with our fellow man.I was barely able to get through the first episode of THE FOLLOWING, at which point I decided I would not be able to bear the agony of continuing to watch -- and vicariously experience -- the gut-wrenching terror of one person after another being so realistically tortured, then brutally murdered.Shameless, unpardonable trash, which can only serve as ""creative"" inspiration for the most deviant among us.",Negative
"I haven't watched TV since 2007 and only watch DVD's. I have to go by product description (for anything new) and this sounded pretty good. It's not a bad show. Although I could do without the bad language and showing people retching. (That's not entertaining to me and I want to be entertained.)  The main character talks a little too fast so I have to back up the subtitles to see what was said. But overall it isn't too bad a show.  I enjoy the 2 main characters (Jim and the Medical Examiner). Good chemistry and good for a few laughs in between the drama. Sorry to say that for me, personally, it isn't anything to get overly excited about but it's not too bad a show. I will more than likely buy the second season. It was entertaining enough. I would probably rate it at least 3 1/2 stars, almost to 4 stars.",Negative
"I became a regular watcher of these and was sorry when the series was not renewed. Some of the best never get renewed, maybe because they cost too much $$$ to produce? After all, networks can made a ton of money turning out mindless babble the masses will watch, instead, made much more cheaply. These were actually thoughtfully written and produced.",Positive
"NCIS is at the top of the list of TV series.  The cast is wonderful, talented and makes every episode interesting!  Of course, Mark Harmon is one of my favorites.  Highly Recommended!",Positive
Sounds like one of her better efforts.,Positive
"It's hilarious and brilliant. They get people drunk, then have them tell the stories of historical events - while big-name actors, in period costume, act them out. But the best part is that the actors lip-sync the dialogue to the drunk storyteller's words. Difficult to explain - you gotta see it!",Positive
"It is a great show, I love the Brits and this is about 2 officers relationship, a younger guy who amazes the older copper as they call themselves. They solves murders together and have only their wits to do it",Positive
Slow moving and very hard to understand what was being said.,Negative
"When I first read about this show, I was intrigued by the premise, and I haven't been disappointed yet--not in one single episode.  The whole cast is terrific, the writing is amazing, and it manages the balance between funny and sad and frightening really, really well, so that I always feel satisfied with the quality of the story telling.",Positive
"Wondered how were they gonna improve the new season after last season. Which was Amazing!! And here they are episode 1 and blew me away, anxiously awaiting next episode. Easy download great streaming and NO commercials!",Positive
One of the best shows on cable. Not only was it funny but in a way educational as well. Too bad SYFY canceled it.,Positive
The Unit season 4 has really up'ed the ante for a secret military action packed series.  I have not always cared for the wives part in the series but was amazed with a well put together series that showed their intelligence and &#34;stand by your man&#34; character.  It got a 5 star rating because it produced a solid written story that was interesting and amusing. It caused me to become addicted to what happens next.  A great series you won't want to miss.,Positive
Good escape!!,Positive
"We thought that the kids in this show were very clever, and were glad to see that they allowed a girl to play a role as a smart kid. If Amazon picks it up, we will watch it.",Positive
"Good episode and an interesting idea for a pilot, I hope Amazon decides to pick up the whole series, decent quality stuff, I was a bit surprised actually.",Positive
See for yourself.  Season 2 is so good my wife will not allow me to watch it with out her.She and I highly recommend this TV series.,Positive
"I won't write you a &#34;book&#34; on this one, others have already done that. This was one well done series, in just about any aspect. Well written, it even &#34;looked&#34; good- unlike the typical SYFY Saturday movie. I always wondered why religion came into the plot line the last couple of seasons, negatively portrayed at that, but maybe the writers were running out of material. Well written even if you don't like the subject matter sometimes, or the enemy ( I &#34;liked&#34; the Goa'uld- seasons 1-8, better than the Ori- 9-10, and even then the stories had something to them.Start at the beginning of the series, not the end, and always be sure to watch the extras each season.This was the best of the three Stargate series.",Negative
Justified rebounded in this 3rd season after a disappointing 2nd season. Hats off to the writers for ending the Raylon/Winona relationship and introducing a group of new villains. This is a well-written and well-acted series. Top notch entertainment. Thank you FX and Amazon.,Positive
"I enjoyed the series, but if you're looking for serious drama, this isn't for you. Pretty unrealistic-apparently one detective on the force, and his ride along partner is the medical examiner.",Negative
Very good series too bad its not shown in America but excellent show with great story lines with lessons to be learned at the end,Positive
"Unlike the Green Arrow in ""Smallville"" this one will kill the bad guys. I never liked the comic book Green Arrow but this one I do enjoy watching as long as they don't start watering it down.",Positive
The evidence is clear we are not alone and have possibly never been must see I have the entire series and it is a good one. Worth the money and the time as the exploration of space may begin and end at home on earth not in the stars.,Positive
This show is perfectly suited toward youngsters who don't need the over stimulation of ridiculous shows like SpongeBob and the ilk.,Positive
I find this seasons very entertaining and the interactions between Sam and Dean refreshing.  This is one of my favorite series that I never get tired of.,Positive
It is a fun show if you like parody and humor. It's likely that you have seen it or why would you be looking it up? I paid for each episode instead of waiting 6 months till it was here on Prime or on Netflix. That has to tell you how much I enjoy it.,Positive
"Too complicated, too unbelievable (who really believes Jane would choose Owen over Grayson?), Stacy has gone from ditz to doctor of emotions, Margaret Cho, such a great sidekick, has been reduced to running errands. Kim has lost her edge for motherhood.  Grayson seems more silly than ever.  Where did the real ""Drop Dead Diva"" go?  Addendum:  Just watched ""Missed Congeniality"" and barely got through it.  Case premises were ridiculous, resolutions even more far-fetched, not even qualifying as fable,just silly.  The show does not know when to strategically use the Grayson-Jane dynamic and continues to place ""interruptions"" to their progress only exhausting the viewer and leaving them wanting.  Each episode is devolving.  I am only watching to see how bad it can get!",Negative
Excellent!,Positive
"Again with the Twilight crap, a lot of boy meets girl stuff, sexual tension, and all, doesnt really concentrate on the tactical, strategic stuff, action,...bla bla. You know another thing, in the beginning of the series they portray the aliens as vastly superior to us, more intelligent,... and then now it seems you can kill them by stabbing them in the mouth, shooting their limbs off,.. also didnt they find that new material for making bullets? So why didnt they just cast bullets and reload for all their weapons including AK's??. The reason I say this is cause some of the guys in the camp keep saying from time to time human weapons are ineffective?? I dont get it, I thought they found new bullet material, and not to mention that Tom blew half a mother ship with target seeking RPG (which doesnt exist in real life) other target locking weapons but not a RPG-7).Now the producers are trying to get you to think that the aliens are some killing machines (at one point Tom says that they can rip you apart with bare hands and....)  but I just cant get into the feeling anymore, cause producers already showed that you can kill the aliens with a knife, shoot their limbs off, kill them with high frequency sound, .... Just saying, it would have been better if they were actually body ripping/dismembmering aliens like the ones in the movie ""Alien"". Same thing with the ""Mecas"" the shows producers are trying to make you believe that there is pretty much nothing that the resistance can do to fight them, then how the hell did they just shoot the crap out of the 3 ""Mecs"" back at that school with Ak's??. I dont get it, are the AK's (with the new bullets) effective ? or not? whch one is it. And if the aliens are body ripping monsters, then how come in every hand to hand combat, every alien got killed by simply being stabbed in the mouth?? Not much of a alien soldier if you ask me..Also, one thing that absolutely annoys me with every alien invasion movie,( and I love alien invasion movies) how come they are supposed to be vastly more intelligent (millions of years ahead of us ) and yet they dont appear to be very good tacticians. If they are universe  conquerors would they have tactics and plans waaay more effective?? These aliens dont seem to be too smart, or capable. IMO the shows producers should have made them more mean (think ""Alien"") smart (you know they outsmart us almost every time) and should they have some kind of force field, of personal shields, they dont seem to be very advanced, besides the flying Toyota Priuses they got...",Positive
My two year old is self identifying letters! Wherever we go she is pointing out at least 6-8 letters and is consistently correct.,Positive
Our family loves this show.  We think the chef's are amazing and it opens our eyes to culinary possibilities we haven't considered before.  It also inspires our 7 year old to experiment with new foods and he's even started making things himself which is fun.  Keep up the great work.,Positive
"Kind of silly and low budget, but watchable with a twist at the end that saves the entire show from being a bust.  Only it leaves to many unanswered questions, but then again I think that was the idea.",Positive
The Housewives shows are my guilty pleasure. I love watching to see what's gonna happen next! It is so addicting!,Positive
"I seem to be in the minority, but for me season 3 represented a bit of frustrating fall off from the preceding years,although it still has it's share of strong moments, and the last 2 episodes are very powerful. But some of the earlier weaknesseshave gotten more prevalent; twists that seem a bit arbitrary, rules of its world that seem to shift to fit story convenience, storylines that get dropped, character choices and complex morality that aren't really explored or are over-simplified, episodes thatseem a bit disconnected from the others.And some of the strengths are less played too; fewer ironic or emotional uses of rock music, fewer visually inventive scenes,and most importantly, less genuine emotion, and more slightly histrionic soapy-ness. (Suddenly the characters seem tocry in every episode, which starts to make those powerful moments lose their impact). And the questions of 'what are goodand evil in a complex world' seem to be less deeply explored than before.  (There's tremendous room to explore 'what is guilt''what is mercy' and 'what is evil' in this particular season, and in the end the answers given seem a bit too neat.)There are also episodes in the middle that feel a bit dull, as if treading water. Perhaps this season would have been strongeras 5 or 6 episodes.Certainly good television, and worth watching, but for the first time I found myself less emotionally moved, and more apt tofind my mind wandering. The climax (which in some ways feels like a natural ending to the series) certainly makes up for alot of that, but not all of it.",Positive
"What is it with Tacoma, WA, anyways?  After all, Ted Bundy lived there when he was a child, and Lee Malvo and John Muhammad lived there as well.  I've been to Tacoma quite a few times, and I will say the following:  it's not a nice place to visit, and I surely wouldn't want to live there.But for some strange reason, Mr. Muhammad and Mr. Malvo did want to live in Tacoma.  The opening scenes show some really beautiful shots of Antigua with Mr. Malvo, and this film did a really good job of showing how he could have been bored while living there, even though it's probably paradise compared to most places in the U.S.  While I've never been to Antigua myself, I've been to enough of the islands within close range to say that I would most likely choose Antigua over Tacoma.  Heck, I'd probably live on the worst island in that region over Tacoma.  (My apologies to Tacomans, or Tacomaites, or whatever they're called.  Kinda.)And this film does a great job of not playing with the viewers' emotions.  So many films use overbearing music for manipulation; not here.  As a matter of fact, I only recall music during one scene:  the pair were driving along the freeway, headed for D.C., and mildly depressing church choir music was in the background.  I thought that the musical selection -- and the director's complete restraint of music throughout -- was perfect.But I believe that this film's strongest quality was:  not exploiting the tragedy, or glorifying it, in any way.  And it does so with real three dimensional characters -- watch ""Frozen Ground,"" where John Cusack was at most a two dimensional character, or maybe don't watch that film even better as I panned it -- which helps you understand what the killers' motivations might have been, even though they didn't seem to completely know themselves.  Sure, Mr. Muhammad wasn't happy that his children were taken from him after a divorce; would you be?  And while I do believe that men in the United States are placed at a huge disadvantage when children are involved in divorce, this film doesn't push an opinion either way on the viewer.  Rather, you are left to your own devices there, and most likely, you will come to the realization that the pair simply targeted the wrong people.  And went overboard doing it.This film made me think about another pair of serial killers:  Leonard Lake and Charles Ng.  Mr. Lake was the father figure, analogous to Mr. Muhammad, while Mr. Ng was the son figure, analogous to Mr. Malvo.  It's hard to say which pair was worse -- to me, these types of arguments always devolve into moral relativism, which is not only a waste of time but also potentially invalid -- since both groups could easily be called ""evil.""  But this film did a very good job by simply concentrating on the father/son relationship between the characters here, which makes the film even stronger.Really strong performances by the leads plus true restraint by the director equals a very fine film.  I'll give a big recommendation on one of the better films that I've seen in a while.",Positive
Definitely a little different season than I would have expected. Mary get pregnant in real life since she is pregnant on the show. New idea in the last episode for the cliff hanger. This shows grows on most people till they get addicted.,Positive
Each episode gets us closer to the answer (most of the time) but the mystery is unraveling faster and faster.,Positive
"Pointless in the very end is all I can say about Pompeii. It really just seemed to go nowhere while trying to mix the ancient times stuff with the &#34;Oh no, it's gonna blow&#34; stuff.",Negative
"Snow recovers from her whack on the head to discover Cora talking to Emma, and immediately goes into protective mother mode. Both ladies get a surprise when the leader of the lost island literally throws them a rope to get out of the pit. It is Snow's old friend Lancelot, and he is glad to help Snow, Emma, Mulan, and Aurora continue on their journey. When an ogre attacks Emma, Snow slays him with an arrow to the eye and the ladies reach their final destination - Snow's castle. The magic portal tree is still there, and Lancelot shows up to help carry the tree back to the lost island. At that point everything goes awry, and Snow and Emma are back to square one. Back in Storybrooke Henry is being hardheaded, and Charming has to save Henry from his own reckless actions. Sebastian (The Mad Hatter) finally reunites with his daughter Grace, and Charming teaches Henry sword fighting, while an old foe watches from his car. There was too little Regina in this episode, but the thought of Regina and Cora going head to head somewhere down the line is extremely tantalizing.",Positive
Probably too close to reality to be a sitcom.  And it really doesn't play well as satire even though one of the songs does riff off the old theme song from the Mary Tyler Moore show.  Really don't care for any of these characters.  Just superficial fluff without a solid center.,Negative
"I did like the Hailey character, but her story reminds me of the Jennifer Beal character in Flashdance.I didn't really care for anything else. It all seems like it has been done before.Highly unlikely that I will be watching anymore of this show.",Negative
the ending was so great!! I cannot wait until the next episode. i also see myself buying blu ray and instant video.bring back alpha house,Positive
started out better than the finish but it was fun and entertaining. liked the strong female influencing characters. i would get another season,Positive
Love dana Delaney in this show. Interesting to see how her family gets brought into the show more this season.,Positive
"Like most musical shows, I enjoyed it as a fun, lighthearted, quirky comedy.  It may not be something I'd get hooked on, but I do think I'd take the time to watch it.  I enjoyed it more than most of the other Amazon pilots.",Positive
"I enjoy Alton Brown's GOOD EATS on so many levels. First, the obvious - the food. He shows you many ways in which to cook a particular food, or within a certain category of food. Second, AB comes from the school of Harold McGee's &#34;On Food and Cooking&#34; where the science of food becomes applicable in understanding why foods react the way they do. How certain foods react with different metals and why some foods get along and others do not (depending on what you do to them). So Alton extends this information in a fun, visual way. AB's humor, to me, really makes this show a fun way to learn about cooking. He has silly characters throughout, running gags from show to show, and has a geeky mannerism that makes his character charming. His style of directing is very well controlled and organized. His panning shots along a counter-top, with ingredients lined up, makes for easy &#34;digestion&#34; of the recipe. He includes little bits of history throughout the show about food or some interesting incident concerning the food. All in all, AB packs a high amount of information through both visual and his hyper-verbal manner of spewing information. If you enjoy cooking or are thinking about it - look no more! This is your source. I also recommend the three books which covers every episode in an almost as informative way.",Positive
"you know I love it, I keep buying the seasons these guys are smart and fun to watch and Danielle is great!",Positive
I watched all of the possible new Amazon Programming that interested me. I thought this was very good. I would like to see Bosch developed and produced also. I do not have the FX channel so I will have to wait until the new season shows up in Prime.,Positive
One of the best seasons of Dexter besides 4 and 7 in my opinion. With a great villain and awesome story this was a perfect start for everyone's new favorite serial killer.,Positive
"Season three opens, with Gibbs going after Kate's killer, Ari. And to try to throw alot at us, NCIS gets a new director, Jenny Shepard played by Lauren Holly. Now Shepard and Gibbs do have some history, since both were partners at NCIS at one time, also. To proclaim Ari's innocence, is Massade officer Ziva David. And I'm sorry, I didn't like her then. And I don't liker her now, She and pretty much all of Massad is built up like they are the only agents that are extremely tough, they're unstoppable. So Ziva and Jenny try to convince Gibbs that he's wrong, and Gibbs even makes the only logical argument against Ari's innocence. That if he were innocent, he would turn himself in. So, after much arguing, he gets Ziva to follow him. And Ziva kills Ari in Gibb's basement, And we get each persons view of how they saw Kate in this episode. Now, I would have inserted Paula Cassidy to the team after this. Since there was some obvious chemistry between her and tony, but no. We get Ziva, and she is built up like I said. As this unstoppable, lean mean killing machine. The best of the best, and I'm sorry, but she's abrasive and annoying. And I still have a hard time accepting her to the team, Gibbs magically trusts her more than any other member of the team. season three is a good season, and Ziva is the on;y reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Although season three does end with almost getting blown up, going into a coma. Waking up from that coma, and thinking it's 1991. And we get to meet Gibbs's mentor, Mike Franks. Which leads to gibbs trying to stop a terrorists attack. Only the generals won't allow it, and Gibbs ends up Quitting NCIS. All in all, season three is still awsome. Like I said before, my only problem is Ziva. The introduction of a new director, and then Gibbs leaving.",Positive
"This series is awful. If you like looking at very faint dots of refracted light taken in photo, or Blankets that were obviously tied to a string in a manner to move them then you might like it. Everyone claims to see a ghost, but their footage is so poor that a ton of other explanations could account for what is presented. Like Bigfoot and UFO's... When real concrete, scientific and fully documented proof is discovered then all this is just non-sense.",Negative
"As a music lover, the pilot for this potential series got enough of my attention to want to see what else they could do with this story.  While I am more interested in the music and less in the personal lives of musicians, I found the competitive aspects of the story to be its strength.  I would like to see more.",Positive
love this show. too bad this is the last season. love watching it anytime I want too. I love it,Positive
The Pilot made me want to see more for sure !!! don't want to go in details to make any spoilersbut worth watching for sure ..First I was thinking .. Revolutionthen Walking Deadthen Terrorist attackthen only one was left .. and I guessed rightbut you have to see it for yourself .. :)Amazon ... I would like to see more !!! please!!,Positive
"Hell on Wheels is set several years after the USA Civil War and concerns the struggles of building the transcontinental railroad.  An interesting time period to explore and very well done set pieces.  It's just shy of HBO's Deadwood in terms of authenticity and character but if you enjoy this time period or ""the old west"" you will enjoy this show.  Good job AMC!",Positive
Great show and I am glad to see season three finally here It was about time been waiting a while keep them coming.,Positive
"I would definitely watch more episodes of this.  The Office-meets-the-Death-Star premise was really well done and very funny.  The characters were distinctive and the voice acting was top notch.  The claymation look was fun to watch.  Perhaps part of what makes it so funny is that, while the setting is fantasy, the emotions and dilemmas, and therefore the jokes, spring from real life: How many of us, after all, have had to work for an ""evil"" (or at least not very inspiring) corporation to pay the bills?  I very much hope we get to see more episodes of this.",Positive
This show is far better than you would expect. John is a legend in the paranormal field and it goes far beyond hokey and is down right intriguing!,Positive
terrible - how do people even get money to film this PC garbage? why must i drone on about how bad this is just make the minimum word requirement?,Negative
"Fargo was an excellent series and more than lived up to the movie that it is based on.  Everything about the series was awesome and the acting quality was on par with such shows like Game of Thrones, Turn, and The Walking Dead, just to name a few.  Since the details of the blu-ray have not been released yet, this is a review of the series only, but when I receive my copy I will update my review.  If you haven't seen it yet and you liked the classic film of the same name, then you will love the series.",Positive
I enjoyed it till I figured out it was all faked.....the plot would be very interesting and compelling if it were true.  Money down the drain.,Negative
I don't always get time to cook for myself so late at night I watch shows like this because they are fun with competition and I get to see new things I would like to cook when I get the time.,Positive
"""This is where the rubber of government meets the actual road of human beings."" Or not.Being produced by the same people as the gutsplitting ""The Office"" gives mockumentary/comedy ""Parks and Recreation"" a lot to live up to. Fortunately its first season is a solid little intro to a promising series -- the first couple episodes are a bit scattershot comically, but it really takes off by the middle of the season. And Amy Poehler is nothing short of amazing.Ambitious Leslie Knopes (Poehler) is a middle-level, rather clueless manager in the Parks and Recreation department. When a nurse named Amy Perkins (Rashida Jones) tells her of a vast abandoned pit that caused her loutish boyfriend Andy to break both his legs, Leslie smells an opportunity.Her goal: fill in the pit and turn it into a nice little park ""even if it takes two months"" (as Amy puts it). So she forms a little committee including Ann, the cynical, lecherous Tom (Aziz Ansari), her indifferent crush (and onetime fling) Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), and perpetually bored college intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza); their committee is overseen by anti-government government official Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman).Unfortunately, they have some problems on the way: Attempts to canvass supporters go awry when Leslie ends up alienating a bunch of people, and Pawnee Journal reporter gets ahold of some very unflattering information about the project (including that Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit). Then Leslie's attempts to get some clout at her mother's award ceremony go painfully awry (along with her fashion sense), and trying to join the boys' club leads to an alcohol scandal courtesy of the wine-guzzling April. And Andy's first post-cast rock concert is disrupted by love life problems that lead to a nasty breakup.""Parks and Recreation"" takes a couple of episodes to warm up to its full comic potential, since the first couple episodes are sort-of-funny-but-not-hilarious, and sprinkled with mockumentary dialogue. Halfway through, the writers really hit their stride, and the show becomes very funny.It's got the mockumentary mix of awkward situations (Leslie and an embarrassed Ann being mistaken for lesbians) and weird dialogue delivered with a straight face (""I'd go to a banquet in honor of those Somali pirates if they served bacon wrapped shrimp"").  And it's got lots of hilarious jokes that are played absolutely straight at all times, such as the macabre and disturbing historical murals that fill the town hall (""That's the great thing about Indians back then -- they used every part of the pioneer""). You don't see most of them coming (example: a pro-park person who is gradually revealed to be a sicko pervert).Amy Poehler is absolutely brilliant as Leslie, a clueless but kind woman, who vastly overestimates her own importance and that of local government. Sometimes Leslie crosses the line between naive and dumb, but Poehler makes her likable and passionately conscientious. And she can say the weird stuff (""To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises"") with a straight face.She also has a very good supporting cast, particularly Jones as the straight-woman who is just immersing herself in the world of politics, Chris Pratt as the lazy Andy, and the deliciously barbed woman-chaser Tom. But some of the characters aren't really fleshed out in full -- April has no dimensions beyond bored snotty teen, and Mark only really gets some good development in the last episode.""Parks and Recreation: Season One"" starts off rather slow for a few episodes, but it has plenty of promise and loads of funny (""This is a childrens slide. You're not allowed to sleep here""). And it shows signs of getting really, really good.",Positive
looking forward to renewal for season 5 as season 1 through 4 were very interesting and i loved them all.,Positive
"My hubs loved the HBO series Deadwood. I couldn't get past the gratuitous cursing. Not that I am opposed or without sin-but it was too much. I went on to enjoy its star, Timothy Elophant , in Justified. Cause..cowboy in tight jeans, bad boy vibe. Not the best TV, but something I could watch with hubs. Hell on Wheels is exceptional TV. Yes, it is gory, and there are whores and cursing..but in the amount that likely reflects the time period. There is great character evolvement..and acts of compassion and love that balance the whole tawdry feel. An excellent study of racial tension, hardship, struggle for dominion over the West, and yes, a handsome, (albeit grubby) cowboy in jeans. A win-win for my spouse and me.",Positive
Always loved watching this series.  Also watched latest Veronica Mars movie - it was great.,Positive
"yeah okay, so it's not a masterpiece.  But it's a nice story that showcases the love between Liz Taylor and Richard Burton.  I loved it and will watch again, and after the scathing reviews on here, it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.",Positive
"2012PG: Excellent production - sort of a mix between a concert and Cirque du Soleil (and the Australian babes were smokin hot.).Lots of upbeat stuff, and a beautiful solo piano performance ('Great Escape') by Pink. She also does a nice acoustic rendition of Time After Time with her lead guitarist. Much more than just a concert. Enjoy MFJLabs 4x",Positive

"My four year old granddaughter loved this film. It is every little girl's dream, pretty clothes, magic, magic wand, ability to make dreams come true.Bianca, the little girl in this film, is very cute,wears frilly colorful clothes, has a cute little voice and likes to have fun. During this 13 minute film, we follow her adventures, under sea, with her friends, singing and dancing. And, all the while Bianca is thinking of her friends and how to make them happy. This is a feel good film, filled with color and lots of movement. The music is Great, easy to danced with and I could see toes tapping, and arms waving. My granddaughter liked Bianca's voice and her easy way of doing things. She could be a Princess or a Mermaid or a singer or dancer. She is everything a little girl would want to be, a little girl's dream.A series with Bianca would attract a lot of attention.Recommended. prisrob 02-10-14",Positive
"This show has some charm about it. It seems to branch off into two storylines -- two mobile app developers try to sell their dating app to a Silicon Valley legend. One short, chubby programmer tries to get a date with a coworker with the assistance of a older, uninhibited pal. The show had a nice balance of technology and human elements. It's very similar to Big Bang Theory, a show I don't like, but isn't bogged down by the laugh track, odd relationship between 4 successful adult males, and focus on sexual obsessions -- well, at least not entirely, not yet. If it can not become BBT, it could be interesting.",Positive
"Ghost Hunters started very modestly but has become something of a showhorse. The exit of the humble Grant Wilson was a foreboding of a slicker production lead by Grant's less humble buddy, Jason Hawes. the strange hirings and firings of last season break open with a new season of celebrity guest stars and questionable evidence. Ghost hunters must be credited, though with the current interest and methods of paranormal investigation copied by so many others.",Negative
This show is addictively good. Watch seasons 1 and 2. You won't regret the choice. I can't wait for Season Three.,Positive
I am looking forward to how this gets wrapped up. Michael and company have some obstacles to overcome and I will not be surprised if there comes some personal sacrifices.,Positive
"ABC should be shot over and over again for not keeping this show. I LOVED IT! I only watched it because of the Amazon ratings. Someone at NBC should try to get it back. This was a gem with great plots, great characters, genuine emotion, and lots of humor---- all so very rare on tv. They made only a couple of mistakes: they needed a little summary at the beginning of each episode so you could get caught up if it was your first episode...you have to do this with continuing story lines. And, sorry, but I thought the lead should have been a bigger, gorgeous guy, although the guy in it was a great actor.BRING IT BACK!",Positive
I really enjoyed this movie (must be my Celtic roots).....good comedic parts and nice emotional pace.  Loved the small town setting!,Positive
"It's a little slow; but, picks up a little towards the end.  If you like Dempsey or Judd, you'll probably like the movie.",Negative
It gets better and better each season.  A few surprises this season that were unexpected.  Never a dull moment.  The life on a crab boat is always so full of tension.,Positive
"I heard a whole lot of comparisons between this film andThe Cabin In The Woodsbefore I decided to give this one a try. And why not? The latter film is probably one of my top three favorite ""horror"" films of all time, and definitely the smartest nod to the genre I've ever witnessed, regardless of how funny or scary you think it is. This film, written long before CABIN IN THE WOODS, tries to approach that same level of wit and insight into the genre, but the problem is that the script is just too shoddy to pull it off.The film follows two gentlemen in a cabin in the woods (natch). One of them -- a young husband and father-to-be named Michael -- has come to visit Chris -- his old, estranged, meth-smoking friend -- in an attempt to finally wean him off of the drug. Michael takes an old-school approach to rehab, handcuffing his friend to a pipe and letting him sweat it out, and as the two bicker (with fairly repetitive and awkwardly curse-laden dialogue) and relive old times, strange pictures, films, books, and recordings begin popping up around the cabin. Where are these things coming from? What do they mean? Will Chris -- the healthiest-looking meth-addict you've ever seen (check out those biceps!) -- be able to kick his habit? Will Michael allow his own pride to blind himself to the fact that something seriously creepy-deepy is going on?The idea behind the film is great. I give it five stars. I don't even fault the film for its low-budget execution, which is pretty solid, all things considered. The film is a mediation on the art of story-telling, especially with regards to horror films, and its constant nods to various horror tropes -- aliens, strange disappearances, Native American burial grounds, ghosts, creepy religious types, foreign scientists -- is cute enough, but none of it is particularly compelling. Even when something pretty creepy does happen -- a mysterious person stares at our leads through the window or a recording of them appears unannounced -- one or both of the characters inexplicably doesn't care, which effectively neuters the response of the audience. If viewers are supposed to be yanked to the edges of their seats, so should our characters, and what they mainly do is just argue about drugs, friendship, and life.Not until the last twenty minutes of the film do things begin to gain some kind of steam, but it's an old fashioned case of too-little-too-late. By then, the bizarre occurrences of the film have become very obvious (i.e. heavy-handed) symbols. This is further hammered home by Michael's insistence on referring to every set of photos, every scratchy record, every cave painting as a ""story."" This kind of overdone symbolism is especially weird considering the film's general insistence on remaining aloof from the typical spoon-feeding you get from most scary films. Smart viewers will get what's going on, but there's bound to be a sizable chunk of the audience who will finish the movie and wonder, ""What was that last shot about?"" In case you missed Michael pounding it into the dialogue: it's about something, somewhere that wants a story.The trippiness of the overall story just doesn't hold enough water to compel the plot, is the problem. And in a movie that is all about the things that make a story worthwhile and that even cause stories to exist to begin with, it's a shame that the producers focused so much on creating a powerful ending without thinking about what it takes to have an equally powerful beginning and middle. As a result, you have a movie that's too smart for its britches, that seems to have been made backwards, with its strongest and greatest ideas placed at the end. But like a powerful anchor attached to sewing thread, this film's ending is stuck to an hour of quiet nonaction that is not particularly creepy, interesting, or even all that sensible (did I mention that our film's meth-head looks like he could be a lightweight boxing champion?), and so the density of the finale makes the preceding hour of movie seem even fluffier and more pointless than it already is, rendering the entire experience kind of a rip-off.",Negative
Bones is always interesting. The cast works so well together and the technical aspects are really quite impressive. I find myself watching re-runs in between seasons. Looking forward to the new season!,Positive
"The past several years have witnessed multiple science fiction movies come out based on a great premise, with top notch special effects and acting to boot, but come up short due to the script.  I would classify this movie as one of these.  The premise is simple, a group of international astronauts are traveling on a spaceship to Europa, moon of Jupiter, to look for life under its frozen ice surface.  Over the course of the mission, both before and after finding life, they suffer various accidents and episodes of bad judgement that lead to their deaths.  The movie's plot of going to Europa to find life is intriguing and original.  The background of story as laid out in flashbacks in the movie are all quite plausible.  However, the movie fails by the very nature of all the accidents that plague the crew.  Everything from the ice cracking under the feet of our intrepid explorers, to hazardous chemicals spraying onto their space suits, it seems this mission was plagued from the start with one mishap or another.  And so the film came out feeling contrived.  Hence the 3/5 stars.",Negative
"Funny show if you like frat-boy humor. A bit raunchy and very immature but the cast delivers, they are all pretty talented.",Negative
Look up Bubble Guppies in Webster's and it will say &#34;See also: unwatchable...&#34;  The writers are obviously from either Colorado or Washington and too stoned to get a story together.,Negative
"Those who grew up watching Johnny Carson will enjoy this the most. Its been 20 years since he was last on the air, and it brought back a lot of memories for me from the 80's and early 90's when I was growing up and my parents watched The Tonight Show nearly every night.Johnny was obviously not a perfect person, but his style of entertainment was so successful, most of us that watched him perform live will always be able to reminisce and realize that somehow the show became an important part of our lives, even if we didn't know it at the time. No matter how bad your day was, you knew you were going to come home, turn on the tv, and laugh. My parents have since passed away, but even something as simple as The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson was a large part of my life growing up, and I found watching this was both sad because its been so long since he was on the air and people like my parents were still around, and it also made me smile because I have so many memories from watching the show many evenings.People like Jay Leno and David Letterman have been extremely successful with their own shows and styles, but nothing will ever replace Johnny, and I feel bad that those who were born after he went off the air will never really know him or The Tonight Show. Overall this American Masters episode did a good job of giving us a small look into the imperfect life of someone that was part of many of our lives for years, and it brings back the memories once again.",Positive

I love cop shows and criminal drama's but private detective shows are great a little few and far between but great. The scene is D.C and two former government agents as private investigators. Great interaction with FBI and local police makes this show a great watch.,Positive
"Im not a chick but I do enjoy ""drama"", when it's done right, and I absolutely love sci-fi. Real sci-fi not that mystical magic crap that makes up 99% of everything that comes on the SyFy channel. This show does have a bit of a slow start but it is worth the wait. Season 2 is even better. Other than Stargate: Universe ""V"" is the top show on tv!",Positive
I enjoyed this show from the first one I watched and will continue buying the season DVDs to watch uninterrupted by commercials until they quit making them.,Positive
An unusual pair of antagonists in somewhat contrived situations. The last episode of the final seasons makes one realize how deeply invested the viewer has become.,Positive
It's an interesting study in characters personality changes for good or bad and how people are friendly when they are opposites.  I am amazed at how awful some people are but also realize that there are people in the world that bad.  Also normal people can ge good and bad at the same time.,Positive
I'm suprised they would make a series like this.  A person would need to be very bored to make it through even one of these.,Negative
Absolutely love this show. Great story lines that will keep you hooked. I love law (I even have a paralegal degree) and every once in awhile they sneak in a legal maneuver even I don't see coming. Can't wait for season 3.,Positive

This was a very enjoyable series to watch. Well done and well acted.  We wish there were more of them - or more like this one.,Positive
"This show is both entertaining and enlightening.  There is a reason this show is in its 11th season, the chefs are amazingly talented and the challenges are exactly what you would expect from a professional chef.",Positive
Am waiting for the final series to be available on Prime.  I have enjoyed this series very much.  Timothy Olifant is the perfect fit for the lead.,Positive
We thoroughly enjoyed the tournament. The rest of the episodes were very enjoyable. Some we liked more than others. On the whole it was great.,Positive

Throughout this day, Jack teams up with terrorist who wants peace, there is an attack on President Wayne Palmer, the Vice President wants to bomb another country, Jack must find 5 suitcase nukes, stop his dad and brother, help his nephew, and a whole lot more! This is one of the better seasons. One of the characters I don't really like at first is Tom Lennox, then later in the day, I start to like him. Then, I don't really like Vice President Noah Daniels, but toward the end of the day, I kinda like him. If you love 24, and Jack Bauer, you'll love 24: DAY SIX!!!",Positive
"I chose this rating because I dreamed the people, the battles and the treatment of aliens by Archer and his crew.  I love this show, it comes very, very close to what I dreamed years ago... I thought Captain Kirk was it with Spock, and I was sorely disappointed, but it really was Archer... thank heaven,,, I love this show...",Positive
Even the Mystery Science cast can't make this movie worth watching. It has got to be one of the worst ever.,Negative
"Not really a plot spoiler, since we have it developed in the first episode of the second part of series 7, where the doctor is basically stalking her, where there is fixed points with the first two incarnations of her as the 'shuffle girl"", Oswin, and then as the governess (Miss Montague)Clara, preventing him from investigating them.This seems to be the thread developed in these subsequent episodes, of the doctor taking opportunities such as the 'empath' to discover secrets about who Clara 'really' is.",Positive
This was a neat first show with it's little twists and suspense. I'm also glad about the the Booth/Bones relationship and I'll say no more as it would be a spoiler. Good show and I'm looking forward to the rest of season 9. I see Pulant (sp) sticking his ugly little head up in one of the next two episodes. I sleep a lot so before I know it I'll be watching episode 2.,Positive
"I'm right there with the Captain...&#34;this is the first time I've seen you since you boarded&#34;...or something to that effect.  I get the feeling that some heavy editing happened before release.  We don't get to see any detail of what those scientists are up to, at least not that I recall. I thought it odd that there was radio silence (except for a select audience of one).  More fiction than science I guess.  I was hoping to get that feeling of urgency that you might have felt in Legend, Outbreak or possibly the Andomeda Strain (the original, not that sad replication for TV).  Pass...for now. I'll wait until it's free on Netflix.",Negative
"(spoiler alert)I was delighted that the winners were a come from behind. My dream was always to try out for this show but it looks like I'll just have to be content with watching it. I like that there is very little back stabbing on this show. Having visited some of the places they go to, it is amazing what they see that I have missed. Good ideas for my next trips.",Positive
It is very enternainig though not realistic. There aren't any parents that would allow their children unfettered sexual freedom at 16.,Positive

"This season is better than the last two. Seasons 1 and 2 were excellent, this one is outstanding. Both main characters are unique. They portray such complex and flawed individuals. The writing is believable and the direction keeps the pace at the right speed, slow and sometimes painful. This is no copycat predictable show. I hope we get a 4th season.",Positive
"It is one of my top 3 television series on TV.  I wish that it had more episodes each season.  By the time, I get caught up into the season; it is over.",Positive
I just finished watching this and I'm sad it's no longer on. I would of watched this for years. The acting the script the scenery and the wardrobe. I was hooked the first episode. It's a refreshing show to watch. It was much more in depth than expected! I loved the characters the actors made me feel like I knew them and they got me involved with each one!,Positive
"We're midway into the season so far, so I'm waiting to see how this all turns out.  Hope I'm not disappointed.  Billy Campbell is not my favorite star, but he's doing a decent enough job.  The young female lead is pretty good, as well.  This is a scifi show that's all premise.  The writing is good, and they've built up a decent amount of suspense about what this helix is.  The acting is mostly mediocre, but everything revolves around a good story line.  I hope that I'm not disappointed by the ending.",Positive
"I give this 3 stars, as I like Jeff and his puppets, but his show could be better. its a little dull.",Negative

"I'm not going to waste much of your precious time with this review. 'Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie' is quite possibly the worst film that I have ever seen. Will Farrell and Adam McKay are credited as producers, and should have known better.The film follows the monumentally untalented duo, Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, as they set out to make a film for one billion dollars. They end up wasting the entire budget, a fact which the film's producer - Tommy Schlaaang (Robert Loggia, obviously working for the paycheck) - is not entirely thrilled about. The two idiots decide to renovate an old mall in hopes that they will be able to pay off the large debt. In the meantime, we are introduced to some of the most annoying, disgusting characters ever written, and are treated to insanely crude jokes involving pedophilia, feces, and body piercing.The writing is horrendous, the ""jokes"" are beyond disgusting and incredibly unfunny, and the two leads are headache inducing morons. Rarely have I ever been tempted to walk out of a film mid-screening. 'Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie' is a waste of celluloid. I hated every single second of it.Magnolia Pictures has given the film the royal treatment on Blu-ray, which includes an audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a gag reel.Directed by Tim and Eric, Rated R, 94 minutes",Negative
"I really enjoyed this show and had several LOL moments while watching it. The show is so completely tongue in cheek satire that it doesn't surprise me that some people just don't ""get it"", but I'm happy to see that most of the reviewers here so far do indeed ""get it"".The show can be completely over the top, while maintaining complete dead pan seriousness and I love that. There is no winking to the audience or any characters that show any awareness as to how absurd some of it all is. The commitment to the caricature of crass, ratings driven media where facts don't get in the way of message is impressive.If you can't accept that hyper-exaggerated anti-politically correct satire is indeed satire, rather than a disguised platform for insensitive or hurtful speech, you might find a way to be offended by the show. I guess the same might also be true for those who's thinking is so extreme that they can't recognize this show as satire. For those of us who can appreciate biting satire, there is a lot to love in this delightfully subversive show.This pilot was among the most slickly produced of the Amazon Original Pilots to debut recently. The movie like look and feel just enhances the sense of satire. Great acting, writing and directing. Very promising and a show that would be at home on any of the better traditional TV or cable networks.",Positive
"I'll bet you never wondered what goes on behind the scenes in your local supermarket: why items are placed where they are, what equipment is used for the checkers, when specials are planned and how careers are made or ruined based on the success or failure of these decisions.Screening audiences attending this 2012 Seattle International Film Festival entry from the USA will never wonder; we got to watch these corporate shenanigans in living color!We saw:* Parker Posey (""Inside Out"") is a recently hired dynamo brought in to re-energize this mid-size supermarket chain. Her take-no-prisoners style is immediately obvious when she fires a high-timer unjustly, simply so she can re-invest his significant salary on promotional material.* Eric Mabius (Lots of TV) is a frustrated music industry professional, temporarily (he hopes) side-tracked into supermarket management. He is seduced by the siren song of success, with a salary increase and unexpected temptation. All his boss wants in return (she says) is his loyalty.* Annie Parisse (""The Amazing Spider-Man"") is our hero's wife, proud of his work ethic and really proud of his promotion! She even might be willing to overlook a thing or two....* Cheyenne Jackson (""Lola Versus"") is a man from that dynamo's past, who has nothing nice to say about her! He stands his ground with her though, which is more than most men.* Julia Bray (Lots of TV) is quite the surprise. Downtrodden, overlooked and derided, she suddenly finds her inner loyal employee and delivers a great motivational speech.As a veteran of the corporate world, I felt the discussions around the planning table had a ring of authenticity, although the percent increase they are discussing sounds waaaay out of line for the grocery business! Safeway and Kroegers should be so lucky!I'll be glad when Amazon carries the DVD. I want to add this to my Cheyenne Jackson collection.",Positive
"I'm kind of ashamed that I love this show so much, but I really do. I always do a Storage Wars marathon when I'm sick (for free through Amazon Prime, yay!), so I've seen quite a few episodes. It's nothing fancy, but always entertaining.",Positive
2 groups fighting arguing and in my opinion have nothing to do with weaponry.  I wish they would have included some normal people instead of guys who thinks they're a big shoot.,Negative
"If you like this series, then, of course buy it. The only problem I had was that it was only eight episodes long. And I attribute this to the fact that Mary McCormack had her third daughter in the real life and wanted to spend more time with her.If it had been a full 12 or 13 episode season, I would have rated it 5 stars.",Positive

"The movie is short, thank goodness for that. The plot was too silly (over an hour stuck in a ATM). The acting was stiff at times, if I was a killer I'd just stand outside the whole damn time????The movie obviously has many flaws and if it was released at a Box Office it would have bombed. I expected something better but just like P2 and other junk films called ""Thrillers"" this movie was not that.",Negative
"There are a number of improbabilities and gaps in this plot. For one thing, I don&#8217;t think forensic voice recognition programs are nearly as precise and targeting as they are represented as being in this drama. What&#8217;s more, the ending is likely to strike viewers as being too generic and unlikely.Nevertheless, the plot set-up is gripping. I identified with the District Attorney&#8217;s dilemma from the start. In a bonus feature interview, co-star Samuel L. Jackson says that this movie project interested him because it promised to be everything he seeks when he himself goes to the movies. It promised to be entertaining, to take you out of yourself and put you directly in the plight of the characters in the movie, to challenge you afterwards to consider what YOU would have done in the same set of circumstances, and, as a bonus, to provide a sort of moral. The movie delivered for me on all those points.What&#8217;s more, there&#8217;s the added attraction of Gloria Reuben&#8217;s outstanding performance as a police detective. She does a wonderful job of showing the guarded suspicions her character has about what&#8217;s really going on. If I were guilty, I&#8217;d get chills from just her look. Her piercing gaze suggests to me that she knows &#8211; and that she knows I know she knows&#8230; Who&#8217;s going to make the next move?",Positive
"Saturday morning is my Roku streaming British tv shows. Husband is asleep. I sit in my recliner with my breakfast sandwich and coffee and flip on Amazon Prime. I've watched Vera, Midsomer Murders, Jack Taylor, but then I discovered Luther.  Without divulging any plots, this is an extremely interesting character, his personal life, and the brilliant detective he is.  In many series you watch, you see characters associated with Luther that you think will last through the whole series.  Don't count on it if you get into watching Luther. It's a suspenseful, gritty detective show, and I look forward to seeing more of the same.",Positive
This is the best show of everything Aamzon is offering and I sincerely hope it gets picked up.  Our entire family will be watching every episode.,Positive
"A bit over the top at times, and somewhat predictable occasionally, but just go with the flow and understand its not a reality and you'll get some decent laughs and have fun watching this movie. That being said glad i watched it.",Negative
"Well, first off this program is actually creative in many ways, but several of reasons is be cause this show is about real people living real lives, and isn't about (A) cops, (B) doctors, (C) lawyers, (D) MURDER.....The Hugh & Rick team seem to have mellowed a bit, and I think that Alex is (and continues to be) a great guy. Pork chop was an interesting infusion this season, and it seemed that he was cut loose just about the same time he was starting to catch on. Good luck to you Pork chop. The duel between Jack J. and Darrel was interesting, but it seems a bit overplayed. It was interesting to watch Justin grow a bit wiser as the season progressed, and swap out &#34;get there i-tus&#34; for safe, sane, and successful.One thing that this season was missing (is missing) is Lisa. Still interesting and I like that the focus was a bit more on the drivers than it was just certain parts of the &#34;haul road&#34;.",Positive
It is one of the best performances ever captured on film. The depth of the ensemble cast is mind blowing.,Positive
"Although they killed off my favorite character (Donna), I believe that was her name; I still enjoyed every moment of this show.  Great series!",Positive
"Season Three presents us with more of the same. The Town of Lunenburg continues to be a major character in the series and the brothers who co-publish the local paper still steal every scene in which they appear though their part in the goings on in town becomes more and more ambiguous and sinister. The byplay between Nathan and Duke continues to amuse and as the season begins it becomes apparent that the shot fired off camera at the end of season 2 as the two were struggling with one another was a tease. New twists include seeing Nathan shot to death and resurrected and he and Duke tele-ported back to 1955. We get to hear the same music featured in October Sky. Somehow the plots seem to become more contrived this year. The mystery of who Audrey is and how she came to be in Haven continues to develop and we are left wandering how long she will remain, will she disappear as mysteriously as she came, and will she reappear. I cared more about the outcome in the first two seasons but it would be a rare show that killed off one of its three main characters.",Negative
I don't have really a beef with this show. Other than these people are really doing this. I do think that being prepared is important. But to go to this extent is a little extreme in my eyes. and it's kind of frightening some of the things that these people are doing. the amount of firearms shown in the homes is disturbing. And if you tend to be a worrier or you're easily rattled. this show isn't for you.,Negative
"My mom said she would like to see this.  Once again, we saw a movie that neither of us knew anything about.I know who Diaz and Mann are, two great actresses.  Kate Upton was one whom I&#8217;ve never seen.  She did a good job for her part.The movie is really about three women, who learn to be strong and stand up for them selves for the fact that they are all important and deserve to be treated like people instead of objects.There may be spoilers below.Mann&#8217;s character is married.  At first, her husband seems like a nice guy.  But, he is cheating on her.  Over the first part of the movie, you really get to see how bad of a guy he is.  He does not think he is doing anything wrong.  His marriage does not mean a thing to him.  He is also seeing Diaz&#8217;s character.  He treats her like she is the only woman in his life.  One day, Mann&#8217;s Character sees Diaz&#8217;s characters number and calls her.  They realize what is happening.  First, they do not really seem to get along.  Diaz&#8217;s character is a bit heartless.  She is a busy lady who has little time for friends, while Mann&#8217;s character is the exact opposite.  She has that grandmother thing.  Super nice, loving and wants to have fun and be kiddy.  They do a good job of expressing the characters personalities.  Thing happen and they start talking.  Slowly, they realize that they only really have each other.  That is until they both realize that the man is cheating again.  This time of both of them!  Then they meet the third lady.  They start hanging out.  Mann&#8217;s character learns that though she is a nice person, there is a time when you have to forget about being kind and take up for yourself.  Diaz&#8217;s character learns to open up a little and be friendly and trustworthy.  The third girl, well, hey, she is beautiful.  Haha You&#8217;ll see.  The movie is all about them finding strength in and from one another.  Though I am a 29 year old guy, I like this movie.  It just leaves you with a happy feeling.  I laughed so hard at many parts of this movie.  I will pre order the blu-ray as soon as it is available.  I look forward to seeing outtakes.  So, check it out.",Positive
"Very Good program. Well suited cast. Good writing. Keeps you watching. Never a dull moment, I wish It was still happening.",Positive
It was a bit bloody and becomes a soap opera with the heroine trying to get her husband to sign off on their divorce papers.  But otherwise just a fund shootem up bang bang type story.,Positive
"I didn't even make it through this.  It was not convincing, scary or intriguing.  Sorry I paid for it now.  Now I am watching Paranormal Witness and that is quite a bit more interesting. Go watch that instead.  Especially the Curse of Lonergan Farm episode in Season Three.",Negative
"Love this show.  There is excitement, romance, suspense . . . all the elements to make you want to keep watching the show.",Positive
This series was a great show/series!  I find it hard to believe it got cancelled after only 1 season.  It was not shown or promoted because it is much better than shows that have made it for years.  The humor is fabulous...very similar to the M.A.S. H. television series.  The major networks all want criminal minds and csi type shows...we loose  with this all the same philosophy.  I wish they would make more seasons to THE UNUSUALS!  Maybe Netflix or Amazon will make their own series of this show!,Positive
I had no idea what I was missing when I didn't include Glee in my shows to watch.  I am making up for lost time and catching up on it now.  The characters are so well played and I am a big fan of anything that includes music and dancing.I highly recommend it as a &#34;must&#34; show to watch.,Positive
"Two fun loving guys (Ariel Levy, Nicol&aacute;s Mart&iacute;nez) and Gringo (Eli Roth) meet a hot Russian model and her two European friends while vacationing in Chile. Character is built for half the film, about 10 minutes too long. We get to know the characters fairly well in this time and they are all flawed. The earthquake hits and anarchy reigns supreme as criminals escape from a prison.Outside of Nicolas Martinez as a Chilean Zach Galifianakis, I found the film boring, even with the young hot chicks. I didn't feel the horror or terror of what is more like a bad street snuff film.Not recommended even as a rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb, rape. Brief nudity-Male butt nudity, scrots, woman with pasties.",Negative
We really like this show it gives you ideas if you are planning to buy a house. We like seeing all the different houses.,Positive
"I really really wanted to like this pilot.  I love all things apocalyptic so I was super excited to see this in my list.  However, I only made it through maybe 20 minutes before I turned it off.  I don't know if the script sucked or the actors sucked but the line delivery was bad, the lines themselves were bad and I had zero investment in any of the characters.  There's the French actress with the perfect husband/child and flawless morals who also happens to be beautiful.  The rich old white lady who whines a bit much for my taste.  The expensive call girl who takes offense at being called a hooker.  The handsome attorney.  The incompetent Latina cop and of course, the black prison escapee who is brave beyond comparison, smart beyond belief and keeps his word when all others wouldn't have.....I waded through 20 minutes of bad character development and even worse plot development before I changed the channel.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.",Negative
"THis is a somewhat low key, hard scifi film.  It doesn't go for cheap thrills or preposterously silly outcomes, but instead follows a mystery to the end with few frills.  That being said, there is plenty of action and legitimate fear, the joy of discovery, and realistic tensions and relationships within a team that lives in close quarters for a long time.  It is well done.As with many goods works of scifi, there is a mystery that must be solved that is essentially scientific.  Beyond the question of searching for ET life, you have to wonder what happened to the mission.  Their work is extremely dangerous, which is very well portrayed, but their inspiration and mission propel them forward.  I liked the way that the recovered transmissions were put together in a kind of retrospective documentary that reveals what finally happened in tiny bits, saving the most significant for last.THough there were few known actors, I also thought the acting was well done.  It's just that they were techies and scientists, whose concerns were rather recondite, but whose passion is apparent.  They bonded as a team, cared for each other, and felt losses very keenly.Overall, I would recommend this for renting but not purchasing - you probably won't want to watch it more than once because it is so low key.",Negative
"Seemed overly campy.  But, I am willing to watch just about anything John Goodman stars in.  These are good actors, the writers just need to settle on some better comedy and they'd have a great show.",Positive
"Dario Argento's ""Dracula"" has a few neat facets here and there that make it interesting, but on the whole it's nothing to write home about (literally or figuratively).Thomas Krestschmann (""Downfall"") does a good job of making Count Dracula seem solemn and dignified and two seconds later seem like a rabid rat.  Rutger Hauer's turn as Van Helsing did absolutely nothing for me at all, and there's potential there.  Half the time, it seemed like he was sleepwalking.  I can't say I ever mind seeing Asia Argento, though, and she does a turn as Lucy.The reason I gave this three stars instead of one is Argento's amazing cinematography (and some of the acting).  He is a born filmmaker, and can make even his most mediocre turns catching because of the lighting he employs and the settings.  He makes ancient Transylvania look like a hybrid between Friedkin's Iraq in ""The Exorcist"" and a few passages from ""The Mists of Avalon"".Recommended for Argento fans only.",Negative
I find it interesting that they were successful in making a show about math actually entertaining. My son liked it and there are no math shows that I know of so I glad this is around for and truly hope it stays.,Positive
Not funny. How many puking gags can you put in one episode??? I'm guessing the target audience for this series is 9 year old kids. They *might* think it's funny. Most of these pilot episodes seem to be targeted for the under 25 crows. Older people watch TV on the web too. Please develop something for grown ups!,Negative
Another full year of Nikita and Percy playing cat and mouse. The ongoing chase becomes boring and predictable. If these folks are so highly trained and skilled how is it they cannot finish a job? This becomes laughable and greatly annoying.,Negative
"There are a lot of reviews on here, and I have to say I am surprised at the number of 5-stars for Season 5.  Seasons 1-4 are the pinnacle of modern cop shows.  This show actually thinks about competing with NYPD Blue in the pantheon of great cop shows.  That's high praise, at least from me.  Of course, Southland follows the contemporary formula of upping the violence levels to ultra-realistic and disturbing heights--yet it has always done so in service to the story.  Either it was realistic and largely unexplored in the genre, so they explored it.  Or it was disturbing, and it affected or corrupted a character, so it served the story--and it was done well, even if it was ugly.  But it worked--and the gritty realism, whether the f-bombs (unbleeped on the DVDs) or the violence, were always used in service to the story, which was generally a show about heroes doing terrifying work and still living their personal lives out around it, even if they were flawed or the work itself ate them up.As a tremendous fan of the show, I went into Season 5 excited and ready for more.They lost &#34;it,&#34; in my opinion.  Characters went too far and were driven by a storyline, but it wasn't what this character would have done a season ago.  I could take that, because sometimes people just make stupid mistakes, but it was part of a pattern of pushing the envelope just for pushing the envelope's sake. At one point, the show just went and did a terrifying episode that was monumentally gripping but pushed the thing over into almost the horror/thriller genre rather than cop show.  It may have even been realistic, but it was clearly the shock-value driving the story, and, at this point in Season 5, the show was driving somewhere I didn't want to go anymore.I finished it out as it aired, hoping things would level out, but it ended on a sour note, and there's no resolving things with no Season 6.  But, with where the writing went, I may have skipped another season of this show anyway.  I never checked to see if the writers changed or if the show was being given notes from the network to be even more over-the-top so TNT could out-do other cable shows that went for shock value, but I really suspect that's what happened here and where the show went off the rails a bit.All that stated, if you like the shock-value shlock stuffed into otherwise decent shows, you might still like this season.  If I was going to recommend a cop show to someone, Southland would still be among the top shows on the list, easily.  But I would really only recommend seasons 1-4 and tell someone not to ruin things with Season 5.  I'm sure it had it's moments, but they really were not worth the less appealing parts, and Season 5 overall is not the way I want to remember the show.",Negative
"This is one of the ""better"" series I have EVER seen on television.  I just watched the last episode and I'm sorry there aren't going to be more.  Excellent acting.",Positive
A Good BBC Police procedure drama. I like it- my wife thinks it is a bit &#34;dark&#34;. But she dislikes &#34;Criminal Minds&#34; also. She thinks that series is way too &#34;dark&#34;.This series is much better than &#34;Wallander&#34;. I like the action in &#34;Luther&#34; and I can understand the characters when they speak. It is not too &#34;English&#34;.I think you will like the series!,Positive
One of the best seasons of one of the best TV series ever. Love that the entire series is now available through Amazon Prime.,Positive
"The Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave in southern France contains the oldest known cave paintings -- works of remarkable beauty and detail that are all the more amazing for being more than 30,000 years old. Since access to the cave is highly restricted, Werner Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams 3D is the next best thing to being there, and what a delightful, awe-inspiring tour it is. The 3D is used to terrific effect here -- you can practically smell the dankness of the caves, and you'll constantly feel the urge to duck stalactites -- and the paintings are gobsmackingly beautiful and haunting -- ""the birth of the modern human soul,"" as Herzog describes it. If you don't have a 3D TV, the Cave Blu-ray/3D Blu-ray combo still allows you to check out the movie, but be aware: this is one movie that really does look better in all three dimensions.",Positive
Both my wife and I enjoy this show immensely! It's tough to find shows that everyone in the family will watch.,Positive
"I really had no clue going into this one. But the show works. I somehow have become invested in a traitorous, murdering, pseudo couples lives.",Positive
"Love this show.  Season 2  just as good as Season 1.  Love the character development and just when you think you have it figured out something changes.  I imagine it happening just this way.  It's the good guys against the bad guys, even after the power goes out.  Highly recommended.",Positive
"This movie is entertaining enough I suppose, but there's no redemption in the end.  Everything is about making deals, winning, money, and power.  Anything that gets in the way of this is just collateral damage. There isn't a single character in this movie who ends up redeeming themselves, or does the right thing, and the death of a young woman gets lost in all of this, and becomes inconsequential, and nearly forgotten.  She was just another bump in the road, another transgression to be swept under the rug.  Life goes on just as before...  I suspect this movie gives us a good glimpse into the world of the American elite, their way of thinking, and the kinds of things that take place every day in their distorted worlds.",Negative
"This is simply entertaining.  The story lines are not predictable and are laid out like a chess game: one must be able to think some moves ahead.  That's the challenging part.  The relationships are complicated among the characters and this can create some less than simple story lines.  I like that but it's not so taxing that the entertainment value is removed.I like the travel aspect, the mystery, and the totally un-normal-ness.",Positive
"They make a lot of assumptions regarding human history. We could have been eating wheat products all along, but only as it grew in the wild. They don't talk about eggs when they dismiss dairy. All animals eat eggs of birds when available, so did we. The biggest omission is the fact that we need fiber and whole grains to force the impacted feces from our bowel and large intestine. If you have an impacted large intestine or bowel, you can't eat green foods because when the decompose they also produce gas that is very painful if it is not passed quickly. I know this because, well, take a guess.",Positive
These shows are much better than the standard U.S. crime shows.....they're grittier and more interesting. Less &#34;glam&#34; and formula driven. Highly recommend it..,Positive
I like this show.  The lead character kinda gives you the willies by staring at people but I like the show.,Positive

Greatest US Marshall series I have ever seen! If you like TV that is fairly &#34;edgy&#34;- you will like this series. Especially if you are employed in the criminal justice field.,Positive
This spin off from the Closer I had high hopes for but it left me longing for Kyra Sedgwick.  No one can replace her in this role.  I bought the entire season to try it out and ended up giving up after episode 5.  This series seemed to mostly revolve around Rusty.  The chemistry seemed dead and the magic was gone.  I wish I could get a refund.,Negative
"There is no  rational reason to like the people depicted in this show.  (Except Jimmy Smits) They are all criminals in one way or another, but still show some humanity at it's basest level.  It is looking like Clay will finally get what he deserves, or maybe not.  As for Jax, well he deserves his too.",Positive
This show was recommended to me by a friend and I found it to be well written with great actors.  It is the type of show that you start watching 1 episode and end up watching 3 or 4 more.,Positive
"A soap opera. Stupid script, bad acting, glaring tech flaws. It promises a lot and delivers a lot of boring stupidity.",Negative
Is this show about nature or about man involving himself in nature. In episode 1 a terrible narrator who talks way too much throughout the documentary speaks for 15 minutes about how he is within 15 meters of the eagle and the eagle is staring at him. Episode 2 is about a lonely man that raises a dozen wild turkeys from birth. You never actually learn anything except that the man is sad when he loses his turkeys. This show seems more about the people filming them than about nature.,Negative
"Inarritu, creator of ""Amores Perros"", ""21 Grams"", and ""Babel"" writes and directs perhaps his best script, actors, and cinematography yet.  He resists excusing or condemning any of his characters.  This narrative device here resembles a certain Aldous Huxley novel as even the smallest details turn out to be crucial.",Positive
"We love Fresh Beat Band sooooo much that we actually bought tickets for our 3 year old to see them in concert in February!

I enjoy flea markets...but this seems a little too contrived and over the top.  It reminds me of the PBS series set up in Britain some years ago which was much more believable and fun.,Negative
"I liked the premise of this original pilot on Amazon Prime. A few inconsistencies or just dumb actions:1.) The girl who is the actress speaks horribly accented English, so much so that it is sometimes hard to understand her. Her emphasis is on the wrong syllable which I find happens a lot with people who have English as their second language and who have not bothered to improve their accent.2.) Again the girl: wanting to go after her phone when they ran from the luxury house so they would not be killed? And no one told her how ridiculous that was? Not even the guy with the big gun who should have a good handle on practicality?3.) The actions of this girl again: she took her time getting back to the trapped people and went back to her apt., bribing the hotel guy, so she could get her PHONE? The phone again. One of the first thing to go when society falls apart, I would think. Don't people have their phones with them the whole time? She also got some food but I didn't get what was so important to go back to her apt. She already had the gun right? I was confused about why she went back there....4.) So is it the writing?The creature was shocking and repulsive so that is good. Please shoot the Irish drunk.Please up your game on this story line, especially with the attractive girl with the accent. Yes, I get that she has a little girl. So? You really risk your life for a phone? Risk other people's life for a phone?So if this gets better I'm in. Please get better.",Negative

"I usually don't like these types of soap opera-ish shows, but we tried it and i think it's one of the best shows on the air. Funny and dramatic, without being melodramatic is rare and often a failure; but they pull this off with style. The characters, of which there are a multitude are so well crafted that their similarities become melded into a casting that demands each get its time to develop and interact in a fashion that can only be discribed as growth; like a real person grows within a family, and like a family grows together and apart. It's real lofe on television; not some concoted formula of what works and what people want to see.",Positive

"For this film to be directed by such a good director in the past. This film misses the mark. Another fictional POV film about an infection in the water off of Maine, that infects the town off shore.

But six episodes do not make much of a season. Plus the cost of it was high. Will rent from now on.,Positive
"This is a hot new show. Its filmed in Charleston SC and has great chemistry. Basic synopsis a young attorney from Chicago faces it off with a good old boy  district attorney from Charleston. The chemistry between these two is amazing, you know one day they will date. Its all based around a very scandalous police force there in Charleston. The attorney and district attorney are starting to see what is happening on the force. I think this show is going to be a true winner. I have watched three shows and cant wait to see more.",Positive
"It is worth seeing but not at theaters, I really would have given it 4 and 2/10 stars because the only real reason is action was at  the last 15 minutes for that I take away one star. 8/10 because I saw one made for TV that had a better story line it was about the rich and the poor not about  Gladiators to me that's old hat. The TV movie the rich ran to a basement room the poor followed,even when they knew they were about to die the rich made the poor sit across the room from them without so much as a hello. if it ever becomes free with prime I'll  watch this one again.",Negative
"Starts off with a story making fun of people that don't read those long 'User Agreements' associated with Internet product updates, then Cartman has an anger problem that is brought out by a misunderstanding about a chart at school (Cartman thinks it represents the length of the boys' penises, turns out it's simply their growth from one year to the next), and another on Key/Cartman volunteering to help crack babies that turns into videotaping the babies fighting over crack with the tapes sold for money.

"Michael C Hall, hot off the HBO series Six Feet Under, plays the title character Dexter Morgan in this series from Showrime Entertainment. A crime scene investigator from Miami who is an expert on blood. He also likes to seeking revenge on those criminals who escape the law by loopholes in the justice system. Believe me this is no CSI show!Created by novelist Jeff Lindsay, Hall and his supporting cast (including Lauren Velez, James Remar, Julie Benz, and Jennifer Carpenter)create an interesting portrait of man whose blood is dipped in both worlds. Hall's baby face showcases an evil side underneath his devilish killer smile. The show is an interesting character study as well as a great murder mystery.There is the  Ice Cream truck murderer who is stalking Dexter and leaving killer clues. The mystery unfolds in these 12 episodes and you will be intrigued by the last episode. This is like a good British televsion series, a full complete story unfolded in 12 parts.The extras on the fourth disk are  two episodes of Showtime's The Blotherhood (which is also available on DVD), audio commentary on the 12th episodes, and a true life crime story. Those of you with computer can read the first two chapters of the latest Dexter novel and a download of the Showtime show the Tutors (soon to be on DVD)Even without the extras, this is a five star killer show...its a bloody good time. This , like House, is what great TV is all about!  I can not wait until October for season twoBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",Positive
Good show - worth watching - sometimes a little over the top but if you can accept this it's fun to watch - a lot better than most of the shows on tv,Positive
"The past decade or so has produced a wave of novels termed ""young adult"" and transferred them to the big screen.  More recently they have become more dramatic, relying less on action and more on relationships.  This movie slipped by me last year but it is now available on Blu ray and it's a good one in all aspects.Sixteen year old Daisy (Saoirse Ronan, ""Hanna"") is sent, by her American father, to spend the summer in England with her Aunt Penn (Anna Chancellor).  Daisy isn't her real name (Elizabeth), but is the name she has chosen to use.  She's a rebel, with little respect for Brits, authority and especially her father and his wife.  Daisy's mother died in childbirth, so she eventually realizes that this may be as close as she gets to a real mother figure.  Daisy and Aunt Penn's moments together are brief, but important.  Penn is rarely home.  She is a political analyst or something.  It's never clear.What is clear is that the setting is the near future and nuclear war is looming.  We don't really know what this back story is all about or who exactly is involved.  We can guess, the usual suspects.  Nothing I've said so far suggests that the film is actually a love story.  Aunt Penn has 3 children and they all look forward to seeing their cousin for the first time.  Tom Holland, so good in ""The Impossible"" is the rambunctious 14 year old Isaac.  Harley Bird is 10 year old Piper and George MacKay is 17 or 18 year old Eddie.After their first meeting, Eddie and Daisy look at each other as if they are trying to read each other's minds.  And maybe they do.  Their emotions well up quickly, if initially repelled.  After a distant explosion produces ground shaking tremors and snow-like ash, the worst has come to pass.  With martial law and extraction coming, the siblings and their American cousin briefly hide in a nearby hunting cabin.  To no avail.  British troops separate the quartet with the girls going one direction and the boys another.  Eddie and Daisy promise to reunite at the rural farm when they can get away.Much of the film focuses on Daisy and Piper's journey on foot back to the farm from the safe house where they have been living.  Daisy grows up quickly as her arrogance and distant behavior is replaced by a focused longing for Eddie.  This is Ms. Ronan's film.  She dives into the role and doesn't let up.  I've been impressed with her ever since her Oscar nomination for ""Atonement"" (2007).  The girl's journey is hazardous by all accounts and is especially harrowing when they encounter enemy troops.  Water and food are all but non-existent or contaminated.  If anything is missing, it's the detail of the backstory.  I spent too much time trying to figure out what has happened.  This is a strong film with fine performances and a well written adaptation by Jeremy Brock, Tony Grisoni and Penelope Skinner.  Directed by Kevin Macdonald chose his cast wisely, especially with Ronan who is remarkable.The Blu ray has a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Macdonald and his cameraman Franz Lustig use digital cameras throughout as near as I can determine.  Many of the shots are from great distance, looking over the rolling hills and dense forests.  The colors are heavily into earth tones and come across nicely.  Excellent black levels as well.  The film is sharp and has excellent contrast.  Watch for the excellent detail in close-ups of Daisy's make-up and clothing.  The somewhat dirty cottage is easily seen.  Overall excellent.  The audio has a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it is very good as well.  Most impressive is the aftershock of the bomb exploding in London.  Animals scurry away at first, then the wind and finally the ground shaking rumbles across the speakers.  Damn good.  In one of the enemy encounters, the gunfire shakes the room which had been very quiet with the scene on display.  A bit shocking, but I suspect that was the point.  Dialog is easily understood.

This is the best cop show on tv. I'm not a big fan of men in hats but Timothy Oliphant aka Raylon Givens makes a cowboy hat look good. As they say he's the coolest cop on tv.,Positive
I have watched this mini series 3 times and I love every minute of it. Every part is perfectly cast. Every line is perfectly delivered!!! Perfect entertainment.,Positive
Worth watching. I had a hard time with the first few minutes watching the actress give the tv interview. Found her to be quite irritating. The movie was good and makes you wonder if the government is able to cover up incidences like this in reality.,Positive
I enjoyed the 3 part series.  Wondering if there will be more.  First rate acting and story line one I could relate to.,Positive
"My wife and I got some great ideas for decorations and we like the &#34;contest&#34; aspect of the show, but ultimately the prissy attitudes of the judges (especially the French guy...go figure) are tough to swallow (pun intended).  I will give the show 2 stars only because of entertainment value and nothing more. You can find better ways to spend your time and energy than with this show.  I'm sad that I will not be able to regain the lost hours of our lives having been spent on this.  :-(",Negative
"Hey, this turned out to be a far sweeter and interesting movie than I expected it to be.  The actors brought some real depth to their roles...if given the chance in bigger productions, I think they will do well.However, it does take a bit of footage to get the premise set up...be patient and maintain course...you'll enjoy this one.  It is kind of like a box of inexpensive fancy chocolates;  they all appear boring on the outside, and many taste pretty bland--but once in a while, you'll get a creme-filled center that just BURSTS with flavor and richness.This is that kind of movie.",Negative
"The show is entertaining, does not bring new story but i still see it is little bit more &#34;realistic!&#34; than (Heroes) and this thing only for first season of (Alphas). The story of group of super powered members headed by a regular person already was presented in (Mutant-X). It is an amazing show for those who like the concept of super heroes. There are few new elements in this show though and that will make you enjoy it.",Negative
I really enjoyed Mr Cumberbatch as Sherlock and figured he would be good in this role.  Kept me interested and intrigued and I can not wait until I can continue with the series.  I do not know why the Brits just seem to be masters at this sort of television.,Positive
"This was a great season and one that I will not forget. I loved the build up in Season 8 to the final season. The DVD was well put together and had some great special features. In particular, I loved watching both the The Making of ""P.S. I Love You"" video and the video itself as this was a great addition (IMHO) to the season, among many others. As you can see I am a big fan and I am going to be sad to see the last season end!

Let&#34;s see....Mike Nelson and his robot friends....Crow, Gypsy, and Tom Servo. These robots remind of The Three Stooges...as robots! It had a great cultic run on TV between 1988-1999 and it looks even better on DVD. With a mighty shout of YES!

"Yeah ok, so it's a little predictable (what romantic comedy isn't??) but it's still a sweet movie. There are some funny and touching moments, too.  I love the scene with the old couple and the bagpipes.  And the comment about the wind beneath my wings is classic!  I thought the characters were mostly good, other than the ""real"" bride... she sort of annoyed me lol. Oh yeah, and the accents seem to come and go, but that happens a lot in movies, too. But other than that, I did love this movie and would recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies.",Positive
"A great escape into fantasy and romance, what fun. Beauty and the Beast from 1987 is still very sweet, but dated. What woman doesn't want to be swept off her feet, but in this one she is also capable of standing her ground. Suspend belief for an hour and have some fun. I am.",Positive

"There is no way to shut off the reply function on this review. If there were, I would.If you are the kind of person who is easily offended or wants to slam an individual for having an opinion that doesn't follow along with the masses, then don't read this. There are other reviews better suited to you. DeeLam and Lee make excellent points for how great they feel the show is. If you want that, then I strongly recommend you go there. Heck, Shinashi didn't even write a review of the first episode, but she felt so strongly about it that she'll attack total strangers to defend it. I guess if you judge a thing by the company it keeps, then let your eyes be the judge and read on.Just to warn you, if you read this you will probably hate me for it. You will probably formulate ideas about my lack of intelligence and want to reply numerous times telling me how bad a human being I am. Likely, you will want to pick apart every word of my review. It may be an attempt to mirror how ""harsh"" one person called this review, or how ""brutal"" another dubbed its author. At this point, I don't even care*. I wrote this to offer another opinion besides the hyperbole being showered upon this episode.Finally, this review is for this episode only. I have watched no other episode in the series. This episode was bad enough that I could not follow it any further. I'm sure you'll want to attack me for that too.I am not writing this to attack or offend anyone... except maybe TLOK. If you feel like my perspective is faulty, ignorant, or just plain belligerent, I don't care*. If you don't even care what I have to say, but want to bash ME for making the comment, I don't care*. If you are a parent just looking for a show for your kids to watch, eh, this will keep them entertained. It has lights and motion. Lots of bells and whistles. It's either this or the Backyardigans (although I think the latter is better conceived). Pick your poison.*When I say I don't care, I don't mean that I don't think other opinions are valid. I just think that attacking my opinion as if it were an academic point to be disputed with counter facts laced with subtle and not-so-subtle inferences and implications of my indignity, THAT I don't care about.The review:1) Aang's epic journey in the original show from the village of the Southern Water Tribe to the Fire Nation did not have to end with the defeat of the Fire Lord. There were lots of other aspects of this world and the personal development of the characters that could easily have carried a whole new story arc. Giving up on the characters felt like a betrayal. Why become invested in their story if you are just going to kill them off?2) The unresolved segue that ended the final season of The Last Airbender, Zuko's hunt for his exiled mother, along with the mysterious fate of Jet, the budding romances of Aang and Katara, and Sokka and Suki, and even the fate of Azula and former Lord Ozai were all like an invitation to come back for the next season, a season that would never come.3) The Legend of Korra suffers from her status as the direct inheritor of the Avatar mantle rather than a third or fourth generation descendant. This first episode is where the protagonist is supposed to shine, but we are bogged down by repetitive info dumps about characters and plot lines from the original that, other than providing latent back story, have no place in Korra's story. The problem is, the writers were apparently indebted to the fans of the original, and felt inclined to provide a brief synopsis of each element of The Last Airbender that would no longer play a part in this new tale. That was spread out ham-handedly over most of the show. It had the feel of a weak story picking at the bones of a once stronger carcass. If you don't like that analogy, pick your own to suit.4) Aang earned his powers. He did not have to try terribly hard to gain the most potent, if basic, versions of the bending techniques, but when he failed to study he paid for it on several occasions. Korra was instantly given mastery of all the bending schools except Airbending. There is no room for growth if your protagonist is already a powerhouse. Characters who start off near the height of their glory are typically in tragedies, not adventure tales. If Korra is not learning, then she is just throwing around power with no relevance to her development, nor that of the story line. In fact, because she is so powerful, it makes her seem like a whiny brat when she can't learn what she wants exactly when she wants. Her flight to the city is more like the running away tantrum of a baby than an heroic quest.No, Korra's story did not need to follow Aang's exactly, but she should not just have everything handed to her. If she had been a fourth generation decedent, that would have allowed her story to stand alone and would have better explained and justified the change in venue I make a point of next...5) The tech of the original show was driven specifically by the bending power of their creators. Firebenders were able to create heat to power the motors that drove their vehicles. Airbenders used kites to flit over the clouds. Waterbenders surrounded their communities in ice walls, and Earthbenders used stone to implement a mass-transit system for people and cargo. In fact, there was no significant socioeconomic development that did not have it's innermost source in bending. There is a reason why we have the expression, ""necessity is the mother of invention"". If you do not need the improvement, it is unlikely that you will make strides to discover it.All of a sudden, Korra goes to Aang's science city and finds microphones, televisions, cars, printing presses, guns, and all the other conveniences of modern society. Did everyone forget that Aang, Katara, and Sokka used to have to make camp complete with camp fires, bed rolls, and fish they had caught from a stream, as well as protect themselves with swords, boomerangs, and staves?Korra is not that old, and Aang did not appear to be that old when he died. This means that the society's evolutionary jump happened in about a quarter of a lifetime. This would be the equivalent of going from the renaissance era to the late industrial era without any stop in between. Bending cannot account for that, especially when this society seems decidedly anti-bending. If the civilizations that came before Aang, all of which had bending powers, had not come up with this super society, how now brown cow? There were-what, 500 or so Avatars before Aang? None of those guys ever ignited a spontaneous information age.Was Aang secretly sporting a Stephen Hawking level intellect that we just did not know about? It makes no sense.6) These 5 points each have an individual negative impact on the texture of the episode, but when contrasted with the oddly exuberant viewpoints of the other reviewers of this episode make one final sixth point, a sort of conspiracy theorist's coffee table distraction if you will. How do you make such a crap-tastic product and find yourself fully stocked with rave reviews? Well, corporations that create profiles on Facebook hire ""Facebook Developers"" to add 2 or 3 hundred thousand ""likes"" to their brands to increase faith in their products. To me, it seems like such a poor product as The Legend of Korra, Episode 1 generating such miraculous reviews is blatantly serendipitous. If you are the author of one of these reviews and take exception to this suggestion, it is merely that. I don't care if it is true or not. I merely point all of this out to highlight the following advice:Think for yourself. Watch the episode with an open mind like I did. If you think it's the best thing you ever saw, ""like"" it on facebook! If you think it sucked like I did, be careful should you place a review that states this. You may just be painting a target on your back, again, like I did. Don't let people TELL you what to like, when to laugh, or to accept their hackneyed writing pell-mell.",Negative
"If you are one of those who believes in the &#34;Rapture&#34;, when the Antichrist comes to rule over us, then put on your bulletproof suit and get ready for some mean spirited raucous satire. This film portrays the A/C as a flashy, overweight, sex addicted man, who prefers to be know as &#34;Beast&#34;. Add the constant plagues of bloody rain, frogs and huge meteorites crushing people, and you get a sense of where this plot is headed. It's a fun 90 minutes of bad language and worse screenwriting-but this one could become a cult classic.",Negative

"This is a well crafted little picture.  It's tough to reinvent the wheel but this is especially true with horror films.  Unless you live in a vacuum cleaner bag, chances are you have probably seen a movie in the last decade with a rampant virus as the antagonist.  Rather than focus on the aftermath of the virus outbreak, here we get to witness its origins.  The message is pretty clear and tips a hat to the 80's genre of horror where sex and sin invariably lead to death and destruction.  However, this is a far more modern approach and my wife and I were both pleasantly surprised.",Positive

"[Contains mild spoilers]A military cargo plane crashes in Battersea.

But it seems there is someone or something in the facilities, too, that is not very friendly to them.You have heard the same story somewhere before. You have seen a young lady with a dog that keeps barking at something in the dark. You have seen some gooey substance dripping from above. Imagine what follows these scenes and that's exactly what you get in ""Storage 24,"" a B sci-fi horror film that does these things in a lazier and less impressive way than, say, ""Alien,"" almost to the point of a parody.But the film's greatest problem is neither the familiar premise nor the cheesy effects; it is those annoying characters about whom I didn't care. I honestly cheered for the poor ""intruder"" that at least didn't keep whining throughout the story.In short, ""Storage 24"" is ""Skyline"" without special effects, or ""Attack the Block"" without humor.",Negative

"This is a spin off from the movie Star Gate with Kurt Russell and James Spader.  The series starts up where the movie left off.The shows were well written, and the acting was good.Of course Richard Dean Anderson gave the show its' sense of humor. Give the show a try.

"So, I'm excited to see works from Chris Carter and I love Sci-Fi BUT I crave ""Intelligent"" writing. Everyone has seen this ""type"" of movie where the world ends etc.....zzzzz gets old fast. They need to jump into the creepy, science fiction aspect of why the events were taking place (instead of the focus on scenes of and people's stupid/irrational behavior) to make this show unique and different. They hinted at it but it's filled with boring human behavior!(*cough: I can watch ""The Walking Dead"" for that same crap). The other issue that warrants a 2 star review is the characters: they are shallow and predictable. Also, I am so TIRED of seeing the same old actor: Adrian Pasdar in every show from HERO's to the 4400. Geez..like there isn't any clean cut American guy type actors out there who could bring a new face for me to look at. Don't get me wrong, I like Adrian Pasdar for his accomplishments but bored of seeing him in almost EVERYTHING..Sci-Fi. Hire an original, Please!!! We want NEW FACES!!

"Neal is a great character because he is both good guy and bad guy. He works with the FBI, but the viewer knows that he and Mozzy still hold all of the Nazi art - a fact Peter isn't aware of, but that strains credulity, especially after Neal and Mozzy were living large incognito in the season premiere so best that the viewer ignores that entirely.In this episode, Neal and Peter host a panel at an FBI conference detailing why their partnership works and why Peter chose him. In a sweet scene, especially given the tension of late between Peter and Neal over the disappearance of Sam, Peter tells Neal that he chose him to be his partner because he liked him - hopefully making Neal feel at least a little guilty about all the ways he is deceiving Peter. The con of the week is fair this week. The real action centers on Sam, just who he is and what the truth is about Neal's father and the crimes that tore Neal's family apart when he was a child. Peter is convinced that Sam isn't who he says he is and tries to convince Neal to let him help. Instead, Neal and Mozzy con Peter. Peter is really very patient with all of Neal's shennanigans. In the final scene, it is revealed who Sam really is but the bigger questions about the past remain unanswered. A good episode of White Collar after a very solid season. I will be watching the next half of the season with interest.",Positive

"Hugo is an interesting character who puts Houdini to shame exiting his crate.  The movie could have been good, if not for all of the close-ups (over and over... and over) of people staring blankly at something.  It made the movie a bit... slow.  Therefore, there is not a constant stream of riffs, but some of the ones they do have are classics.  Be careful with your souls, because good definitely dies in this film.  Enjoy!",Positive
"I have issues with monster movies where the female lead is always dressed and looking sexy tousled, her hair and face just so, even as she sweats her way from one near-death to another. That was the funny part for me. I laughed. There is no chemistry between these two as they try to make their way home to the US from the alien-infected jungles of Mexico. Yes, the movie tries to make a social commentary about immigration and keeping the Mexicans out. Here, a huge wall is there to keep the aliens out, unsuccessfully, it turns out. I'll credit the film with not overdoing the scares. There is more threat of scare than actual scare. The aliens looks like giant shrimp, and while not entirely believable, they look okay for cheap special effects. The other effects are better, such as the wreckage left behind where the aliens have been rampaging. The script stinks, and the two lead actors are bad. Should you watch? Maybe. Just don't expect much.",Negative
"Mutant Chronicles finally makes its way to DVD, and despite some negative press surrounding it, the film as a whole isn't so bad at all.  Taking place in the distant future where Earth is run by four warring corporations, a race of mutants is awakened and begins laying waste to everything and everyone in sight.  Spiritual elder Brother Samuel (Ron ""Hellboy"" Perlman) thinks he knows how to lead humanity to salvation, so he gathers a crew of soldiers for a suicide mission.  Most notably among them are Thomas Jane (The Mist, Hung) as rugged soldier Mitch Hunter, and Sin City's Devon Aoki; and they all make their descent to save the world.  While Mutant Chronicles is capably directed and features CGI effects that range from halfway decent to Sci-Fi Channel (or is it ScyFy Channel now?) quality, the film's biggest flaw lies in its pacing.  The first half of the film is sadly boring, but it does manage to pick itself up for the second half, and doesn't let go as the film races towards its conclusion.  Jane and Perlman are good, and despite the dim lighting, there are some fairly decent action scenes to be found here.  All in all, Mutant Chronicles isn't anything special in the least, but it is definitely worth a look for sci-fi/action fans at the very least.",Negative
"Does it really matter that everything takes place in the prewar-war torn UK? I think not, this is procedural crime solving at its best. The characters feel real and as the series progresses, one becomes involved with them and what transpires in their lives. I was hesitant at first, I grew up listening to my father's &#34;war stories&#34; and saw almost every WWII TV show/documentary/movie ever made during the 50s and 60s. I really didn't want to see more of the same. This is very different, its about people, well one man, Christopher Foyle, and what happens in his life while he masterfully solves crimes. You can watch his process while he solves the current mystery (the UK, especially in the small villages, is rife with murder it seems) all the while trying to do his bit in the war effort. If you like well-acted British crime drama, try it.",Positive

"Spoilers coming....This new version of Trek, with young actors playing the younger versions of the TOS crew, is exciting from beginning to end, with lots of action, adventure, humor, and creativity.  You have to keep up with the time travel twists, courtesy of LOST co-creator JJ Abrams.  And a certain very important planet filled with pointy-eared folk disappears. This makes certain events of the later series impossible.  You might also find it odd that Spock and Uhura have a thing for each other and don't hide it, that Sulu carries a sword into battle, that some Romulans have tattoos, and that Sarek looks awfully old and is awfully nice to young Spock--much nicer than he was in TOS.  Chris Pine has blue eyes, which Kirk never did.  And Uhura is little more than eye candy.If you can handle all of that, though, you will like the movie.  The fellow playing Chekov is adorable, while Karl Urban really takes the cake as McCoy.  Zachary Quinto is a marvel as Spock.  It would be nice to see more prequels, actually.  And we still don't know all the events that transpired while these folks were going through the academy.A great summer popcorn movie for sure.",Positive
"The first episodes provided a huge problem/mystery for the characters in the town to deal with, and the writing was character driven and solid, though the (cheesy sci-fi) premise wobbled beneath everything.  It has devolved in the last two episodes into almost unbearable cardboard, with the introduction of Natalie Zea's character (waste of an excellent actor), her mother, the one note female sheriff's deputy, the four kids, horribly underwritten and unevenly played, the underground fight club (yawn).  Won't even watch it for free anymore.  The actor playing 'Barby' can carry a lot of weight on his well-muscled shoulders, but Hercules himself would sink under the weight of this tanking turkey.",Negative
"It seems quite a letdown that Richard Gere's impressive performance in this handsomely mounted 2012 thriller has been relegated to On Demand, but the same fate befell 2011'sMargin Call, another effectively Machiavellian Wall Street-set thriller, probably because the mechanics of cutting big financial deals just doesn't feel all that cinematic despite being terrific showcases for able actors. With his trademark &eacute;lan in check, he plays Robert Miller, a billionaire Wall Street investment executive whose silken imperturbable manner can charm and kill at the same time. Miller's company is in the middle of a federal audit as he tries to sell it. The problem is that he has illegally borrowed more than $400 million, well beyond the true value of the company. The lender threatens to take his money back, but Miller stops at nothing to keep the fraud under wraps, his family and the IRS in the dark, and his firm functioning more or less as usual.Miller is simply unflappable no matter what the circumstance is, whether it's negotiating an unethical high financial deal, attending his 60th-birthday party, or spending a few tempestuous hours with his mistress, a French art gallery owner whose neediness makes Miller vulnerable to a moment of truth he cannot control. An unexpected event literally leaves blood on his hands, and a web of deception drops him further into an abyss. Instead of seeking absolution, Miller moves from chilly manipulation to unrepentant criminality. The evolution feels seamless because Miller never sees anything wrong with what he does, and first-time director Nicholas Jarecki does quite a capable job of maintaining the pace and momentum of an internally driven thriller that allows the main character to unravel in a series of dialogue-heavy scenes courtesy of Jarecki's insightful screenplay, an excellent sophomore effort (his first was co-writing 2008'sThe Informerswith Bret Easton Ellis).Although he was a last-minute replacement for Al Pacino (who would have brought an earthier dimension to the role), Gere is smartly cast here because his screen persona has often provided a glacial veneer over a seething core of anger and resentment. Playing Miller allows him to do just that in a most arresting manner that makes him both morally repellent but oddly sympathetic. As the detective intent on getting Miller convicted, Tim Roth is quite effective down to the Columbo-like inquisitiveness and Jersey Shore accent. Nate Parker brings unexpected depth as the moral center of the story, a Harlem kid whom Miller previously helped out of a jam but who now faces much bigger consequences returning the favor. Indie breakout Brit Marling (Another Earth) affectingly plays Miller's sharply analytical daughter, the chief accountant of his firm who slowly realizes her father's true nature. Susan Sarandon has relatively few scenes as Miller's insulated wife Ellen, but her steely intelligence comes through in the climax. It's worth seeking out.",Positive
"Not as good as season 5, 6 or 7 but okay too.But I was very disappointed with the ending.Stargate definetely deserved a big impressive ending.For heavens sake! - such an awesome TV show - we are talking TV HISTORY:and then this weak lame ending........zero stars for the creativity of the writers involved.",Negative
"&#34;If everything was great then nothing would be great, nothing would be special.&#34; Amy (Roberts) is a naive college grad who dreams of being a poet and being published. After sending samples of her work to every publisher she can think of she is disheartened when they all turn her down. She reluctantly takes a job at an adult sex shop while waiting for her big break. She also meets her idol Rat Billings (Cusack) who turns out not to be what she was hoping for. First and foremost this movie is entertaining and easy to watch. On the other hand though its pretty generic and predictable. Emma Roberts continues to grow as an actress and it's only a matter of time before she wins an Oscar. The movie itself is OK and worth seeing but this is nothing all that special and isn't really one I would watch over again. There is both comedy and heart in this but real substance is lacking. All that said though I do think this is fun and entertaining but don't expect to be blown away. Overall, good and worth seeing but really only once. I give this a B-.",Negative

It would keep them engaged after the show doing the projects. Great concept, can't wait to see more, especially since many schools are cutting art programs.",Positive
"The only thing that is missing in this series is more mention of the other ""Great Reforms"" that were happening across the country.  The opening of new territories, homesteading, Indian Wars, the start of the environmental movement and the battle between conservationists and preservationists.  Many of the Temperance women were also key players in the push for environmental reform and had great success with using their roles as keeper of the home and protector of life to make improvements like public sewers, garbage removal, and safe drinking water.  The feeling was that America had lost her way from what was envisioned by the Puritan settlers and that vision needed to be brought back alive.We can also see the same tactics being used over and over to legislate morality today.  But my favourite part was the movie telling the horrors of alcohol. This script appears to get dusted off and updated when Reefer Madness came out decades later.

Could only watch three episodes. Blatant attempt to manipulate emotions over abused little girls-- then episode ends by using little girl to accomplish what no self-respecting (and copper isn't) lawman should do for the sake of justice.

I like the people, the acting is excellent for the script and whenthe program was over, I was glad I found this show..",Positive
"Movie pretty much goes like this. A soldier gets captured when his base gets attacked. He breaks free and runs into a group of other soldiers where he is rescued by a model that can't speak who is leading them. They take him back to the base and he joins their army for the time being. The model leads the troops into an unfortunate situation and they loose 99% of their army. The survivors flee for their lives and the real movie starts as a plot turn erupts and they are now being hunted by the model. Along their journey the soldier runs into another model in the middle of the woods that saves them, then some other stuff happens and the soldier finally gets his show down with the model that can't speak.Overall the story is well... not the best... the movie is entertaining... you can watch it or miss it. There's nothing really ground breaking here.P.S. I enjoy the ""not helpful"" votes this review is getting. This is actually scene for scene the plot of this movie. Which makes this more interesting.",Negative
"Sadly this series was short lived, no doubt because the actual crime elements were rather pedestrian and predictable. However it is a great character study and poses the interesting dilemma of how a good man copes in a hopelessly and overwhelming corrupt society. At about the point the series is heating up... it was cancelled. A poor decision because improvement in the stories, with more payback for the viewers, was all that was really needed. Good acting, great ambiance. Deserving a better fate.",Positive
"I had high hopes for this show, but now I see that it has been cancelled and will only run for 13 episodes. Sadly I am not completely surprised. This show really tries, and I think for many, it does not move fast enough. I was hoping also that since Terry O'Quinn from Lost was featured, that it would have more to offer, but I like O'Quinn's character and the rest of the cast in fact. That is the only reason that I keep watching. I like strange and creepy shows like this, and have been since the days of Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond, The Outer Limits, Lost, Fringe, etc. I do like the setting for this show; a haunted old building called the Drake converted to an upscale apartment complex, and modern tenants confronted with the paranormal. I only hope that there will be other shows that are more successful aired in the future.",Negative
"Like most other reviews here I loved the premiere, but every episode since has just gotten worse.This last episode ""Another Fine Navy Day"" was the worst yet. Seemed to me it was more like a stalling tactic - that the writers didn't know where to take the show - so they just drugged everyone and we have to sit through 45 minutes of stupid hallucinations that simply annoyed me. I found myself fast forewarding through parts I was so disappointed.The writers had better get on the ball with the next episode or risk losing more and more viewers.",Negative

"I've watched most of the pilots here and I have to say, this one is my favorite.First off, I'm okay with the fact that they had to use animatics because stop-motion is a long process. For the segments that were fully animated, it was gorgeous. I loved the lighting and colors. Stop motion animation is medium that is severely underutilized in my opinion. Pure eye candy. It's too bad that a some people will (understandably) lower their rating because of it being unfinished. The comedy is good too - really good considering this is only a pilot episode. I thought the stoner humor bits were kind of weak, but the rest was solid. Was laughing the whole time.I also really like the premise. Plain old joes working for the bad guys because they need the money, while the people who they work for don't particularly seem fond of their jobs themselves. This is all wrapped up in a Star Wars theme which can potentially create a lot of really interesting situations.Dark Minions is charming. It really stands out from the crowd due to it's animation style and premise.I loved the episode. I would recommend it to people who love all things sci-fi and silly.

"They lost me at the start, that overused gimmick of beginning a movie in mid stride only to abruptly put a halt to the unexplained action by pulling back to another point in time.  In effect saying, never mind, pay no attention to that guy running in the snow, it's not about that...yet.  I immediately start to worry when the beginning has to be started twice.How historical this was I do not know and frankly it didn't pique my interest enough to find out.I will say that it was action packed, very bleak and very violent, with a whole lot of running/chasing/running, more running, even more running...fighting, running, more fighting.  I found it amusing that the Romans were a bit put off because the Picts fought ""without honor.""  Meaning that they didn't fool around but got down to the business at hand: kill or be killed.  They were obviously better at it because they didn't weigh themselves down with heavy noisy armor.  Nor did they march in formation and group themselves into easy targets.  Basically, this was a combat picture and a lesson in enemies (sometimes the person sitting next to you might prove more hazardous to your health than the people you are fighting).  This movie was even structured a bit like a horror film: high body count, horrible ways of dying, few left while the closing credits roll.  And!  Unmemorable characters, I forgot who was dead who wasn't, I started counting heads, found that difficult because so many people were losing theirs.  In the end, I was left wondering what the point was; who were you supposed to root for?It helps to know that this movie did not fare well in the UK, which explains why it went straight to DVD after that.I am glad I watched it, not a bad time killer, but it didn't make it into my collection.",Negative
I just bought a season pass to &#34;Almost Human&#34; and I love it. It's a nice mix of robots and police men solving crimes and these two trying to get along.

I highly recommend it to anyone who liked Monk or Sherlock Holmes.,Positive

"Great story idea.  Great ensemble of actors.  Terrible script, editing, WAY of telling the story.  Puts one to sleep, no identification with the characters, no backstory to justify hanging in to watch during the long mimic-BBC pauses with the meaningful looks.  Yawn.A Gary Oldman or Alec Guinness or Ian X (really, any of the 'Ian' actors we all know and love), can hold the viewer's interest, during long Brit-like pregnant pauses and silences, which alike baffle the average audience.  Yet actors you rarely see on TV or film, need something more;  they need LINES, or at least meaningful blocking.  Since these long pauses and silences don't seem to add to the plot at all, and since there is no backstory to establish empathy with the characters, one is left waiting waiting waiting for something to be said or done to justify watching further.Some of the reviewers are all happy about the sophistication in the storyline.  Yeah, but if you're watching paint dry for most of each episode, the sophistication doesn't 'pay off'.  We don't need car chases and shoot-em-ups, we need MORE LINES.  Shakespeare knew that.  So why didn't the script writer, here?  Who messed up this good story?So I forced myself to get through the series.  So I don't wonder why AMC pulled the plug.  It's bad scripting and bad film editing; not the acting, and not the plot.  WAY TOO SLOW, people.  WAY TOO LACKING in lines, subplots unexplored, so of course the viewer will be bored.  Were I a potential commercial sponsor, I wouldn't want my commercials playing during this show, due to its snoozy presentation.  Not fair to the actors or the plot, either.  A story which needs to be explored (whether plausible or not) -- just got wasted.  Pity.FIX IT, please, and redo so the audience can follow along, cut all those long meaningless pauses with headshots, substitute meaningful dialog instead, so the audience can connect the dots.  People like whodunits, that's the most popular story format since the Garden of Eden.Then, you'll get a good audience.",Negative
"***There are 4 actors omitted from the video details:Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys (as Elizabeth and Phillip Jennings)Margot Martindale (as Granny) and Annette Mahendru (as Nina)""The Americans"" is for viewers who thrill to think and feel ""out of the box"". It's especially geared to viewers who are able to suspend personal ideologies as a way to explore competing mindsets. And most definitely it's for people who do not wince at a serpentine/circuitous vision of good vs. evil. Without the influence of the anti-hero trend (Think Homeland, Dexter), this series could probably not even exist.Having watched every episode, and many of them twice, I'll admit that I'm hooked on both the show and watching through Amazon every week. Super convenient, cheaper than a cable upgrade and no commercials.I'd like to add a review (SPOILER ALERT!) of a tough episode to watch: #3.  The ""Gregory"" episode literally takes no prisoners. It shocks with violence as loyalties run raw and destructive. Laced with bleak images and flashbacks, a big chunk of history gets packed into 45 minutes, maybe too much ""history"": It soon becomes clear that Gregory has been the fulcrum of the Jennings's teeter-tottering relationship for 14 years. And that's a revelation which hits Phillip like a molotov cocktail.  Episode 3 exposes the deepening faults in a dangerous partnership and sham marriage. Despite the fatalist vibe, if you plan to even occasionally watch this series, the ""Gregory"" chapter is a must see.",Positive
"I feel like I've watched this story line in other shows umpteen times before--the male main character who's rough around the edges, but also kind of a hero.

I chose this rating because its really just all informative reviews of their opinions in what they do and how they do it when they go to these auctions.  Most reality shows are stupid and don't have meaning or purpose.  Just a bunch of people getting together to tell the world of their lives and businesses they make money off of.

The characters are believable, the stories interesting and the scenery real; I can't say how much that meant to the production, seeing the real Italy instead of someplace trying to masquerade as the setting of the story settled me in for the long run immediately.The tightness of the ending of the first show had me laughing so hard that I loaded the next show without even considering how late it was, and it was very very late.I was really disappointed to learn that there had only been one season filmed, but I was intrigued enough to purchase the next book in the series to see if the writing was as good as the show.",Positive

"Japanese auteur Takeshi Kitano made a name for himself with idiosyncratic crime dramas about the Yakuza, characterized by long static shots, creative editing, bursts of graphic violence, and deadpan humor. Though Kitano has since expanded his oeuvre to include comedies and art films, his latest export, Outrage, finds him returning to his roots, chronicling a Yakuza power struggle during a time of societal transition. After a handful of creative departures over the past decade, Kitano stated that he intended Outrage purely to be entertaining, and he succeeded. Screened in competition for the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2010, and it's already got a sequel slated for this year. If you're a fan of Kitano's work, particularly his mob films like Fireworks or Sonatine, chances are you'll probably enjoy this film.",Positive

"There seems to be a tendency to think that ANY TV show that we watch and like should automatically warrant a five star review rating. I have never felt that to be so and would accordingly rank the various shows I watch on a regular basis from 3-5 stars (most falling into the 4 star designation). I say this in preface to my comments about the second season of CW's ratings challenged adventure ""Nikita"" because it is a show that has improved substantially since its debut. I loved Season One, don't get me wrong, (largely due to the incomparable Maggie Q) but a number of elements never quite gelled for it to truly reach its potential. Some supporting characters were ill defined or underutilized, Alex's complete freedom to talk to Nikita as the plot dictated seemed awfully convenient and unbelievable, and the new recruit interactions seemed forced or took us away from the main action. But still, I tuned in every week (and just rolled my eyes every time Alex was in the empty computer lab in the middle of the day chatting with Nikita) and appreciated all the good stuff! Still, I would have regarded the first season as a 3 1/2 star endeavor with some brilliant episodes and some not so stellar.When I tuned in to Season Two (I guess I was one of the few as it is consistently one of CW's lowest rated shows and that's saying a lot for CW), I was absolutely floored by the show's changes. It was like they reached into my mind and corrected everything I found lacking in the preceding year. And with that, ""Nikita"" emerged as this year's most improved program AND the season's most underappreciated treasure. Why is this fantastically complex and rewarding spy drama being subjected to a slow tortuous death in the ratings dungeon? Being relegated to the dismal Friday night landscape didn't help, but with all the cookie cutter procedurals on the air--I'd still have thought the ladies of ""Nikita"" would demand some attention! This year, leads Maggie Q and Lyndsy Fonseca have consistently served two of the most surprising and multi-layered roles on TV.I won't give away much of the plot, but I will say that all of the actors have been given a chance to shine. Maggie Q and Shane West (Michael) are now working together and the tribulations of mixing missions with romance is a constant struggle, as both have large secrets emerge from their pasts. West has a lot more impact now. Aaron Stanford (Birkhoff, mostly comedic relief in the first season) now works with our rogue agents and is given additional drama and development, showing a whole new fully explored persona. Fonseca is now liberated (but still tied) to Division and her complicated back story is explored with much detail, giving her a chance to shine in terms of performance. The invaluable Xander Berkeley (Percy) starts out with a seeming lack of power, but still engages with sly cunning and understated menace. And the show finally utilizes Melinda Clarke (Amanda) in the way this great actress deserves and she devours the opportunity to step into a leading role.Season Two consists of 23 consistently entertaining episodes. While some are stand-alone in nature, the serialized structure of this year's main story arcs really provide the show with renewed focus and purpose. Enigmatic newcomer Dillon Casey is a new foil for Fonseca, and it's fascinating to see exactly where his loyalties lie. The show also wisely brings back some memorable guest stars from Season One including Noah Bean as upright CIA analyst Ryan Fletcher and Devon Sawa as rogue agent Owen Elliot. Seriously, Season Two is an expert blend of action, plot, and characters. It has moved from a show that I liked to one that I feel passionately about. If you are one of the viewers that jumped ship for the second year, I strongly encourage you to check out what you've been missing! KGHarris, 4/12.",Positive
"Definite an interesting and riveting series.  Does not mince words or tries to make the Vikings anything but what history has recorded, but does give some great insight into probably how they lived.  Strongly recommended.",Positive
"Is it personal? Is it political? It's hard to determine the message being sent by a mysterious murderer with a perplexing agenda in the FX drama ""The Bridge."" When his violent acts, staged as elaborate ""statements,"" get more varied--we're left with a terrific mystery that only grows more intriguing as it gets more complicated. This adaptation of the Danish television series doesn't try to mirror the chilly Scandinavian feel of the original (where the bridge of the title is between Denmark and Sweden). Instead, it wisely opts for a more volatile and timely setting. Here, the bridge connects El Paso, Texas with Juarez, Mexico and the serial killer is working both sides of the border. In making this decision, ""The Bridge"" becomes more than just another murder mystery. It is also a study of contrasts in class and race, a commentary on immigration, and a gritty travelogue exploring the grim realities of life on the border.The FX channel, to me, has long been a leader in adult and challenging programs. In fact, they virtually changed the landscape of basic cable original programming with two of my all time favorite shows in ""The Shield"" and ""Damages"" and provocative button-pushers like ""Nip/Tuck"" and ""Rescue Me."" If not for the adventurous FX (which continues to churn out some of TV's best shows), I don't think other networks (especially AMC with hits like Mad Men and The Walking Dead) would have been as likely to develop original programming. So thank you FX! Not all of the great shows should be on premium cable! And, let me tell you, ""The Bridge"" fits comfortably into the niche of quality entertainment made for audiences looking for great storytelling. I'll be honest, though, I wasn't totally won over with the premiere of ""The Bridge."" Its unraveling plot points, complex characters, and intensifying mystery drew me in a bit more with each episode. I started out liking ""The Bridge,"" but have ended up being its biggest proponent. Like a fine novel, the series requires attention and patience, but that commitment is duly rewarded.The initiating crime in ""The Bridge"" is a show-stopper. A body is discovered halfway between Mexico and the United States on the busy crossing point. Upon closer inspection, though, the corpse is revealed to be two halves of different bodies. One victim is a prominent American, the other is a murdered Mexican. Uniting both countries, the task force leading the investigation is headed by Juarez cop Marco Ruiz (Demian Bechir) and American detective Sonya Cross (Diane Kruger). Each has a complicated back story. Ruiz seems to be a good guy struggling in a corrupt system, Kruger suffers from Asberger's Syndrome and is haunted by a violent past. I know that many who sampled the series were put off by Kruger's portrayal of a difficult character. I, too, was initially wary of yet another scarred lead (both Homeland's Claire Danes and Hannibal's Hugh Dancy--ironically, married in real life--already push my crazy quotient when it comes to professional crime fighters). But as the series settles into its groove, I was more and more fascinated by this take especially as more intimate moments were revealed.As I mentioned, though, this event on the bridge is just a starting off point to more elaborately staged crimes. Matthew Lilliard and Emily Rios play El Paso reporters caught in the middle of the nightmare and both are terrific. And another story thread involves Annabeth Gish (my choice for most underrated actress working today) as a wealthy widow who discovers her former husband was involved in some interesting border activity of his own. The various story threads weave around each other expertly. As they overlap, the show develops a real resonance. Other great performances are given by Ted Levine as Kruger's boss and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Oscar nominee for Maria Full of Grace) as Bechir's wife. I want to save my last remarks for Bechir, though, who turns in one of the season's finest performances. Already an Oscar nominee (for A Better Life), his multi-layered work here is a major selling point and should be considered as next year's EMMYs roll around. Overall, I loved ""The Bridge."" It starts with a good idea, but continually gets better and better as the episodes move forward. It may not be the most popular show of the summer, but for me, it has been one of the most satisfying. KGHarris, 8/13.",Positive
"Easy to get addicted to watching this program.  Great acting.  Since I'm unfamiliar with  the way of life in Kentucky, I can't draw any conclusions as to how realistic this program is - - except that in the first program, a US Marshall makes an offer that the crook simply cannot refuse.  Its nice to see the good guys prevail in a conflict every now and then, even if the 'good guy' gets into a boat load of trouble as a consequence.",Positive
"I recommend that you watch Silence of the Lambs again. I did this after watching the first season and appreciated the series even more.  I watched the movie when it first came out and although I thought it was a great movie, I didn't care for it very much because of how disturbing it was. I watched it again because I felt like I was missing out on some inside jokes during the series.... and I was right.  They do a very good job of keeping true to the dialog and story.  The actors in this series are amazing. Each show is creepier than the previous.  I'm enjoying the show more than the movie because there is more psychological content to keep me interested.  I think if you like serial killer stories, Criminal Minds and the like, you should give this a try.... but watch Silence of the Lambs again.",Positive

"WITH GREAT POWER (a/k/a WITH GREAT POWER: THE STAN LEE STORY, 2010, 80 minutes, for Epix Channel) was one enjoyable, fun documentary. It is the story of Stan Lee, born Stanley Lieber, the Brain Behind Marvel Comics. In my estimation, he along with his three trusted artists IS Marvel Comics.Told entirely by Stan himself, in mostly modern interviews and some footage from older appearances, this really covers all bases I wanted to know about him. I have read two forgettable biographies, and saw one other documentary about him - and they were all lousy. Maybe that's just me but this documentary is the one to see, the only one.With great power, as Stan learned early, comes great responsibility. Even in documentaries, perhaps most especially in documentaries. There are important appearances/commentaries here from luminaries such as Nicholas Cage (who calls Stan ""a father figure"") and Patrick Stewart (who, like me, thinks Stan is greater than Shakespeare).I have this rotten feeling I was cheated by the version I watched, because there are lots of credited no-shows, like one of my favorite actors, Thomas Hayden Church and one of my favorite directors, Roger Corman. Can't imagine where these boys got off to - and Nicholas Cage isn't much of an addition to the facts presented here: he gets about a minute of face time and part of that is a filmed spontaneous encounter he has with Stan someplace.More than compensationary are the moments such as Stan sneaking up on Robert Downey who is attending to some adoring fans - he turns, sees Stan and says, ""I'm too famous for YOU!""To which Stan loudly yet sweetly says, ""You're damn right you are!!!"" as he gives Downey a big hug that is fiercely returned. But that's not why I love this documentary. This is a special work, dedicated to Lee's life, accomplishments and his newer endeavors. It does not dwell on the painful (one being the lawsuit over the movies being made and Stan being cut out of the process entirely).Instead, it reminded me of my youth, when Stan's comics were fresh and the world was abuzz with him and his work. In those days, suffice it to say Stan Lee was, for my generation, a little comparable to God. Except we knew if we wrote to Stan, HE just might answer. We knew he existed and we even thought one day we might get to meet him and a few of the artists who drew the comics.The importance of Stan Lee, that causes me and Patrick Stewart to say he is greater than Shakespeare, is not only his writing and other genius - it is his deep understanding of human pain, our pain, his own pain. It is his ability to take pain and spin it into the purest gold there is. This documentary concentrates on that, and may I add it is an invaluable resource to track exactly what (and when) Stan accomplished such great work for this world.It really matters little who you are: you have to get this. If you're expecting Hollywood gab and 'insider' peeks at the Marvel films or Stan's production company works, not much is here. If you just sit and enjoy, I promise it will teach you more than just the meaning of real power.Stan Lee himself will teach you why it is that with great power comes great responsibility, and he'll show you how he made it his life's theme.",Positive

"instead of thinking that Japanese message they intercepted was a trap to lure more naval personnel into the area, they should have tried to make contact with the USS Indianapolis and then if contact failed they should have immediately launched a search and rescue mission.secondly the ship was overdue, and still no contact was made by the navy with the USS Indianapolis, nor any search and rescue enacted.this was a case of many innocent sailors dying because the Navy did not care enough to follow through.too many navy personnel died while other navy personnel ignored their cries for help.what was never discussed was who from the navy who ignored the above,  and were they ever prosecuted and found guilty?too many unanswered questions which deserve answers now, and i hope we finally learn all the answers to the above concerns.too many navy personnel died while other navy personnel ignored their cries for help.lastly the naval officer they said was guilty of negligence, while all survivors said he did everything to keep them all alive and went above and beyond, but nevertheless the navy made him feel so guilty he ended up killing himself.......now that i call grave naval injustice, and a loss of the life of an exemplary naval officer, who went through hell on earth in the sea but still managed to keep many crewman alive to be rescued.",Positive

"If you purchase this DVD, make sure you watch the extras on disc 4. Forest Whitaker discusses how the Kavanaugh character was conceived as someone who ""becomes"" Mackey as he pursues him, and you will certainly see a transformation over the course of Season 5's eleven episodes. It would be very easy to over-hype Whitaker's contribution if it weren't so spot-on perfect. On DVD 4, series creator Shawn Ryan states that he wanted Whitaker for this character and there ""was no second choice."" If you remember the famous 1998 episode of NYPD Blue called ""Raging Bulls,"" in which Dennis Franz's Sipowicz and James McDaniel's Lt. Fancy come to explosive blows after a long, slow simmer, imagine what happens immediately after Kavanaugh asks Mackey in a rage-filled voice ""Are you happy NOW...Detective Mackey?"" There was a strong undercurrent of racial tensions between the NYPD Blue characters, which led (in a large part) to them both reaching the breaking point, but Mackey and Kavanaugh are not at odds with each other because of their ethnicity. Over the course of the entire season, the subject is never approached and it is not a relevant detail in the conflict. They're two men who began with the right motives and slowly let their circumstances determine their mission. There are mixed opinions surrounding the Glenn Close ""Capt. Rawling"" story arc experiment from Season 4. In a few short days, Whitaker is back for a second season as Kavanaugh, and the events of Season 5 were grounded more in risk taking than stunt scripting. The Shield is a brutal, intensely creative show with one of the best casts and creative teams on TV. By creating synergy with the events laid out in the pilot episode (and multiple references in the ""extras"" portion of the set to ""Shakespearean"" drama), it's clear that this series aims very, very high and more often than not hits the target.",Positive
"The humor of the 'staff'' synergy is getting better with time.  We enjoy the banter and viewing of some crazy, historical and ecletic items.  Recommending to all with humor!",Positive
"This Canadian series holds onto its excellence in the release of season two. The name flashpoint refers to some event which brings a person to snapping and taking the law into his own hands.  That person is also about to do something awful, such as kill other people.  This squad has to do one of two things, either calm the person down until he surrenders to them OR kill the person before he can harm others. They are all excellent marksmen plus skilled in calming down people who have hit the flashpoint.  The series is set in Toronto.",Positive
"I'm not really sure what to say about this show. Mix of &#34;Lost&#34; without the flashbacks with a little end of the world mixed in. I was entertained, but I still don't really know what the show is about which is where I get the Lost reference. I'd like to see a few more episodes, so I guess I would suggest extending the show.",Positive
"Typically, I love Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. I had high hopes and sadly, this movie just didn't do it for me. I felt the plot was a bit weak and obvious / dull / been done enough already... The supporting actors were just so so. I wish SS had a larger role, I don't enjoy Tim Roth or Monica Raymund, so was disappointed to find they were part of the cast. Thankfully MR didn't have a large part. I watched while doing some hemming, so at least my time wasn't wasted.",Negative
"very eye opening.  just like proabition, our goverment has messed up again.  make them legal and the budget will be in the black. our war on drugs has been a costly failure.",Positive
I love this show. The writers are keeping the story line going and I enjoy the team work in the show. My Daughter watched an episode with me one day and now is ahead of me in the number of shows watched.,Positive
"Love this show! I had to break up with The Following because it just wasn't plausible (all the procedural gaffes aside...how can anyone's necktie be askew ALL THE TIME?!). Hannibal is elegant, refined, well-dressed, and damn sexy. Mads Mikkelson will have you saying &#34;Anthony Hopkins who?&#34; (it's no easy feat to make the viewer able to visualize someone else as the infamous and well-fed Dr. Lechter). Yes, you will have to work at understanding his accent--but constantly leaning in on the edge of your seat every time Hannibal is on-screen is part of the character's appeal. He has your attention. All of it. The story line is enthralling (overall it is ongoing, but there are shorter arcs), and the show is beautifully shot. Every frame is like a work of art. If you're a fan of the genre--you need to be watching this show.",Positive
"I quite enjoy Daniel Tosh and think the rough spots of season one make him more fun, especially with the crassness and inflated ego he develops for the TV version of himself.",Positive
"A modern day babbelon five without the space ship.  This show has great actors, an excellent plot line, great special effects, and is without a shadow of a doubt.  One of the best shows on TV.",Positive

"Having watched all five seasons my wife and I were sad that it was discontinued, but glad it was offered to American audiences.The characters are very engaging and the story line is interesting.It was interesting to watch the characters grow as the show progressed.We wish that it had been continued, but everyone has to move on at times...",Positive
I love the actors and the characters they are creating.  For reason I think I have seen them on TV in real life in some of the same situations.  Haha..  Strange fiction relating reality.,Positive
"Although Season 6 only contains 4 stories, it is well worth having as the stories are classic Agatha Christie with all the twists and turns she is well noted for. If you have never read Christie, now is the time to enjoy her devious mind.",Positive

"First let me preface by saying I've followed Doctor Who through most of it's lifetime, never got that excited about it.Then there was the whole Russel Davies resurrection of it and I was hooked.  It jumped the shark a lot over the seasons, many omg what were they thinking moments, but if you twisted your ""head"" just right, it was a pretty enjoyable experience and I've watched seasons 1-6 multiple times and not regretted the price of admittance (Amazon for a lot of it).Season 6, enjoyed it, though was getting a might tired with the ""and then there was a paradox... and everyone lived happily ever after"".  Moffat, I've loved his stuff, Hyde and Sherlock being two series well worth watching.  Though admittedly several years later I still puzzle over Hyde.That said...  This season for whatever reason they're doing ""small stories"", that winds up being pretty boring and predictable.  They're getting rid of Amy and Rory (that's happened in an episode that's aired already so not viewing that as being a spoiler of any sort), and they wind up spending way too long with everyone giving each other long sad looks.... Boring.In this specific episode, plot was predictable, their work on having the Doctor being at a ""darker"" place since he's been wandering around without companions a lot doesn't work all that well.  The cyborg in the episode, well, I think I could come up with something better looking.Alien ship lands in the old west in the USCyborg looking for the doctordoctor and companions show upI'm being kind by giving it two stars and no have no desire to see the episode again, just not that much fun.",Negative
I love all the these characters. They are so much fun. Each storyline is original and fun. I look forward to the next season.,Positive
what a great show. very macho though. my wife says too much violence. i says plenty of action. great writing.,Positive
I am a big fan of Agatha Christie's Poirot and the PBS  programs are wonderful. David Suchet is a marvelous Poirot and plays him masterfully. It is a pleasure to watch these programs and I highly recommend them to any Poirot fan.,Positive
"When you hear Mike and Harvey bantering back and forth, it is the best conversation between two smart men I ever heard. Also, the plot lines are very smart making the legal profession seem brilliant at times. I will recommend this TV series to any discerning viewer who demands cut-above TV. The acting is very good and the pictorial scenery is spectacular. NYC is a great back-drop to this excellent series.",Positive

"Spoiler Alert. In the season finale, our hero is shot and left bleeding on the kitchen floor.  I don't know how this happened, but then the network sponsoring this series decided to cancel the series!  The series had some good (not awesome) forensics, good dialogue between characters, and some reasonably good acting, which altogether somehow inclined me to give it a 5 star rating.",Positive
What an interesting series...filmed in toronto and pretending to be nyc.  only the natives recognize local sights and buildings.  writing is excellent and acting is great.  gabriel macht is a loveable douchebag well paid lawyer.  he grows on you and his new side kick slash apprentice steals the show!,Positive
The stories are good but I don't care for the way it jumps back and forth from one person to the next.  I would rather see one complete story before moving on to the next,Negative
"The knowledge that we get to see Zooey Deschanel at least twenty-some more times in prime time (Fox recently ordered a full season of New Girl) was the best news of the year until Sarah Palin announced she would not be running for president in 2012. Maybe Zooey could take her place and subvert the Republican Party with her hipster aura? Headlining a show on Fox, she's already halfway there. New Girl is an absolute delight. Much like the American Idol judges tell great singers they ""could sing the phone book"" and still be entertaining, Zooey Deschanel proves with New Girl that all she has to do is ramble nonsensically onscreen with those cute anime eyes and be utterly captivating.The instant success of New Girl comes as no surprise; the show has many levels of appeal. First, it is infinitely quotable. Good luck escaping, ""Pink wine makes me slutty,"" at the water cooler. Second, it follows the tradition of strange living arrangement sitcoms (see: The Big Bang Theory, and just about every other sitcom). Third, it is quirky and offbeat, which gives elitists something to latch onto, while remaining relatable and mainstream (its sense of humor is reminiscent of Apatow comedies). Fourth, it lacks a laugh track, which automatically earns it the label of ""smart comedy"" by many critics. Fifth, Zooey Deschanel. Zooey, Zooey, Zooey. Just put a pair of glasses on her, give her a dorky character to play, and it has the Tina Fey Effect. We look past her supermodel good looks and somehow believe she's a nerdy girl like us.The surprise appeal has another name: Max Greenfield. You might remember him as Calvin's hot teacher boyfriend on Greek, and his dreaminess hasn't faded in his new role. As one of the three dudes that Deschanel's character, Jess, moves in with, Greenfield's Schmidt is known for saying things that require putting dollars into a ""douche bag jar."" Together, the three-guys-one-girl ensemble is an instantly familiar gang of friends we wish we had. The pleasure of New Girl is derived from the feeling that you're in on a series of very well crafted inside jokes. And in terms of writing, well crafted jokes they are. This new girl is here to stay.For more reviews check out enter-detainment on blogspot!",Positive
For those who still like to watch cartoons this is a good one for adults it has a little bit of everything in it,Positive
One of my favorite comedies of all time. I would highly recommend. Every season gets better and better. Hopefully there is a 5th season.,Positive
"This show is very very dark and violent, however, it really give you a good view on how things are really like in Detroit.  Detroit is a broken city, and I hope this give folks an idea of how it can happen.The cops do things they shouldn't do.Children should not watch it.",Positive
"This show shows you just how things can get out of control.  I feel for these people who live alone and have just given up on life, it's very sad.  Some of them seem like really nice people and this shouldn't be happening to them.  If you want a dose of reality, this is a show to watch.  Sometimes when I think times are tough, this show proves it could be a lot worse.  The 1-800-GOT-JUNK guys seem really nice and considerate of people's possessions, given the situation.  Dorothy is great, Matt is wonderful and I absolutely love Dr. Zasio!  They are all wonderful people who try to help those less fortunate.  A true reality show!!!",Positive
This is truly a good show. It is more realisitic than alot of the older shows. Tom Selleck just seems to get better and better with age.,Positive
"I've never actually watched Entourage, but I'm willing to bet that my initial reaction that this is ""Entourage for nerds"" is probably pretty right on. It's written both by people who know how nerds talk without pandering, and people who have watched quite a few sitcoms in the last ten years. There's honestly nothing super-duper special about the show, but I rather enjoy it. The main characters fall into distinct categories (Anti-Social Nerd, Terrible Nerd, Main Character Nerd and Super-Dweeb), and Ed Begley Jr. is pretty underused (because he does weird very well, and I want more of that weird), but the characters actually seemed realistic, down to earth, and normal. Terrible Nerd falls into a lot of the traps that most of the other characters of his ilk do, but again, nothing that seems out of the ordinary. It seems like the show might be a good slice of life comedy for techies in modern day Silicon Valley, and it's made cheap enough that I could see it getting picked up just because, well, why not?",Negative
"The basic storyline is a female drives a van through Scotland seducing men.The film opening has a faint muffled voice. It is the alien being learning to speak. What appears to be an alien comes to Scotland and tricks men into coming into her world where they can't walk on water. I wasn't sure if this was real science fiction or something like that Jake Gyllenhaal thing and this was just another metaphor for human relations...which it still could have been. The film changes direction about midway.Scarlett plays an almost robotic alien, very slow and deliberate in her moves. She doesn't know how to respond to many situations. She asks for directions as if she was reading from a foreign phrase manual. As far as Sci-Fi goes in this genre I think ""Phantasm"" was more entertaining and ""Liquid Sky"" more clever.Her acting was well done, but as far as entertaining, if left something to be desired. Clearly this is not a film for everyone.Parental Guidance: F-bomb, sex, attempted rape, full frontal nudity Scarlett Johansson and a bunch of guys get naked in this film. If that is what you want to see, this has got it.",Negative

"I love Dr. Who, and the Christmas special is no exception.  My only complaint is that it would be nice to have the entire season, including the Christmas special, available as one TV Pass, instead of having to order the special separately.",Positive
I like the idea of showing children that science can be cool. Up the detail of the science and keep the cuteness. A tad bit more personality for Anne would be welcome.,Negative

"I cannot say that Almost human has never been done before, nor could I tell you that the notion of human and android working together is new, but, the cast and contrast between the two is done to perfection. The plots are interesting and definitively hold ones attention. It's an interesting contrast to see Karl Urban, after seeing him in the movie Red with Bruce Willis, and then as Dr McCoy in the new Star Trek movies, now to bring what is essentially the same type of character, the hard ass veteran yet still humorous cop, a role he plays so very well, to the small screen. And although the premise of the show is also not new, the good cop betrayed, yet somehow now with the help of and equally flawed android as a partner, he is now able to rebuild his broken life and career, which as you will find are pretty much one in the same thing. The show is well worth the effort to watch, and quite enjoyable. This show is greatly Recommended",Positive
"Forget the &#34;traditional&#34; animated Christmas programs, except for Peanuts and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, of course, this is the movie families should watch every year. Yes, it's in black and white; yes it's sappy and sentimental. But it also reinforces timeless ideas that we need to be reminded of at least once a year -- if not at Christmas, then just before the new year when we're thinking about resolutions.",Positive
"Always an entertaining show. A combination of Perry Mason, Hill Street Blues, the Godfather and CSI as the McDeere's try to stay alive between the competing forces of the Mob, corrupt law enforcement bureaucrats and the Russian Mafia. A good show!",Positive
"Wings is cool, it's slow paced, but cool none the less, I would like to see more clean comedies available",Positive
Funniest series ever....political or otherwise.  Garry Trudow really nailed it.  I hope there will be more seasons to come of this.,Positive
"Very believable characters! Shows the conflict between a small English hamlet and the larger village nearby. The young heroine constantly finds her days as postal clerk busy and challenging. The subplots involving the mailman, the dressmakers, and the Dowager Countess lend wonderful insights into a bygone era. Watch this one if you enjoy Downton Abbey or Emma!!",Positive

Gritty. Riveting. Interesting characters. Great multi-layered storyline. Keeps you wanting more. Love my Amazon Primme  providing excellent series for FREE!,Positive
"The song had some semi funny lyrics, but I'm not really a huge fan of musical tv. Never watched Smash and couldn't get through an episode of Glee. During the song it looked like there was some bad lip syncing going on by the asian girl, and I could let that slide since it's not always easy to do. But after the singing was over it still looked like she was lip syncing, when nobody else did.The writing was alright, the cast was kind of annoying. If this were made into a show I wouldn't watch it.",Negative
Thought this show was about high school kids so didn't watch it... But the grandkids got me into it because of all the show tunes they sang and they thought Lea Michele was such a great singer..so started watching it every week.,Positive
"I have to say, before halfway I was tempted to turn it off and thought that this show is a bit boring, slow and uninteresting.but after going through  halfway toward the end, I think this show has a good potential to be a hit.I can sense the possible love triangle between the dancer, the oboist and the conductor, and I think that might be an interesting subject for the kind of audience this show trying to aim for, (I'm guessing its targetting the kind of people who like Girls on HBO)It ended in a way that make me curious to watch the next episode, so I hope that they will pick it up for a whole season.I think I will watch the entire season if it were available.",Positive
"Note: I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.When I saw the promo for this show, I though, ""A TV version of the film Chicago,"" but as I continued watching, I saw that it's more than that. It's Singin' In The Rain meets All About Eve coupled with a unique prespective on show business. Plus, it stars Debra Messing, Katherine McPhee (who is extradorinarily beautiful and has a lovely voice), Jack Davenport (Commadore Norrington in the Pirates Of The Carribean movies) and Academy Award winner Angelica Huston. Besides, Mr. Spielberg himself is behind this drama (he's an executive producer) and THAT, my friends, sealed the deal for me. Anything that has Mr. Spielberg has his name on (with the exception of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Super 8 and the Transformers films, having had to sit through the abominable first installment) I'm willing to give a shot. I recommend this series.",Positive
did not enjoy this movie. it was not what i expected it to be. maybe next time i will ask for information about it.,Negative
"If this is the only way to get somebody to learn history, we have a social problem of epic proportions.  Bad bad message.  I watched a few shows and was appalled.  There are a million documentaries with better content, and the delivery isn't coming from someone who is slurring, puking, or curled up on the floor.  How low can you go.",Negative
"I have not read the books so this is all new to me, the actors are great in show esp. the lead. The non set like locations were refreshing. Is the show character driven or procedural, is it following one case all season? An okay show but nothing new creative wise and would have to hear from others after few episodes if worth pursuing further.The ending was not satisfactory as we are left not understanding sense of it!",Negative
The best series I think I have ever seen. The writing and acting and story was addictive. I miss it.,Positive
"This is quality Television. A uniquely different look at Police work and the complexities associated with the jungle we live in. Keep the show coming, I look forward to character development and fresh plots with each new episode.",Positive
"I loved the Mozart in the Jungle pilot!  I've always thought that there should be a movie or TV show like this, showing the symphony behind the scenes.  I've seen glimpses in other TV shows like Law & Order and that Columbo episode with Blythe Danner.  These people are talented, and their lives are intriguing and sexy!  I hope to see many episodes of this show, hope it has many seasons.",Positive
Good character development; great action; good story lines.  It's nice to see the season without advertisements and without having to wait a week for each episode.,Positive
"Loved season 1 and season 2 did not disappoint.  Wonderful show, nitty gritty, real.  Wish they did more seasons.  So interesting that the shows were based on real incidents and people.",Positive
"Great show, one of the more interesting ones I've seen",Positive
"Having watched every season of the British hit ""Being Human,"" I was a bit wary of SyFy's American reinterpretation. After all, for every successful translation (The Office) of a British gem, there are dozens of failed attempts (Coupling). While I'm sure that I will anger the many avid fans of the original show, I will say that its first season (for me) was wildly uneven. I enjoyed the progress into later years as the plotting became darker and more complex--but while the show had an initial charm, it wasn't perfectly formed right out of the gate. So I was open-minded to this reboot. While some loyalists will contend that it is an utter failure and some newbies will proclaim it is brilliant, I fall squarely in the middle. Once again, I find myself thinking this is a good show with the potential to grow into something far richer and more rewarding. The British version started as an enjoyment and turned into great television. I think that the U.S. version has the same opportunity.For those new to the concept of ""Being Human,"" it is perhaps one of the most unique and (let's admit it) most ridiculous ones on TV. In its outrageousness, however, it is completely irresistible! What if a ghost, a werewolf, and a vampire shared living quarters as best mates? You think the trials of tribulations of being young and attractive in the big city makes for great drama--try adding this supernatural component for a bit of fun. Sam Witwer has an intensity perfectly suited to the role of a tortured blood sucker. Sam Huntington has a goofy appeal as a befuddled werewolf. And Meaghan Rath is a serviceable and pleasant apparition. In my opinion, the cast between the two versions is on a relatively even playing field. I actually prefer Witwer in Season One, Rath is somewhat blander yet also less annoying, and Huntington (while incredibly likable) has a hard time measuring up Russell Tovey's pitch perfect creation. Don't get me wrong. I really appreciate Huntington's easy charm, but Tovey (with Sinead Keenan as Nina) give two of the most underrated performances on contemporary British TV.The premise of the show is that the three roomies crave normalcy above all else. But it's not an easy road. The first couple of episodes stick very firmly to the British template, but then the scripts branch out in a welcome way. Primary plot points in this season include Huntington's courtship of a new girlfriend, Rath's investigation into her untimely death, and Witwer's political struggle trying to extricate himself from a vampiric organization. Witwer's plot line has the most meat and is very well done. With terrific character pieces by Mark Pellegrino and Terry Kinney, this arc is the primary reason to catch this incarnation of ""Being Human."" The trio of leads plays off one another with ease, but have yet to develop the chemistry of their British counterparts. All in all, though, I think the show holds promise and the potential to grow. If you've never seen the original, I think that you'll have much to appreciate here--if for no other reason, the concept is so strikingly different. For fans of the original, I suppose a mixed reaction is to be expected--but I, for one, was willing to go with the flow and enjoy myself. KGHarris, 9/11.",Positive
I tried to love this show but it is really awful. The acting is OK but the story line is terrible.,Negative
Great Series.  I love the cast.  They meld well together and their personalities are all over the place.  They keep you guessing.  Anticipation of what will happen next keeps me coming back week after week and impatiently waiting for the next season to start up again.,Positive
"While this series is somewhat predictable in its good-guy/bad-guy sub-plot, the novel concept of exploring &#34;troubled&#34; people (AKA those manifesting &#34;odd&#34; powers and talents) makes the series compelling.  Agent Parker (our main protagonist) is somewhat barbie-doll like and lacks some of the sophistication expressed through characters in series like FRINGE or WAREHOUSE 13, but she serves as a great backdrop for the story and is surrounded by some excellenty developed main characters.  Fun, not too serious, engaging.",Positive
"Love the Show, would have given 5 stars, but the video was a bit choppy.Hope this stays on for a while.",Positive
One of the best series of all time if not the best.  Storyline  and acting superb and ended when it should have.  There was nothing more to add but it leaves a gaping hole in entertainment.,Positive
I had to re-watch the seasons to get ready for new season and it's great can't wait for new season.,Positive
"The Raylan/Winona relationship is beginning to grate on our nerves. Walton Goggins has replaced Timothy Olyphant as our favorite character. He has a powerful screen presence a la James Dean, Paul Newman or a young Marlon Brando.",Negative
"I have been an enthusiastic fan of Justified since the pilot. I love all of the characters, and the actors and acting are first class. I'm just finding this  seasons plot a little too convoluted and hard to follow. I will keep watching, but just saying, liked prior seasons better.",Positive
"While not bringing anything new to the bloated police procedural genre, featuring some shocking crimes and an unconventional protagonist, the BBC production Luther (2010-13), is an entertaining and engaging crime drama.  While not particularly credible, the singular exploits of Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) John Luther, make for an interesting and captivating watch, as Idris Elba (Pacific Rim,Obsessed) portrays the brilliant, but troubled and flawed investigator, who lives by his own set of rules.  As aspects of Luther's personal life become more entwined into the criminal investigations, a certain sense of predictability occurs, but there are still a number of twists and surprises along the way, that keep things lively.  Some spoilers follow, so proceed at your own risk.Series One (2010) contains six hour long episodes, the first opens with John Luther obtaining critical information from a serial killer, and then allowing him to fall, and become critically injured.  With the killer in a coma, Luther is in the clear for the moment, and is reinstated by his chief Rose Teller (Saskia Reeves), and assigned a new partner, Justin Ripley (Warren Brown).  His first case is the investigation of the murder of a husband and wife.  Luther suspects the couple's daughter Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson), and resorting to his accustomed illegal methods, obtains evidence of her guilt, but is unable to arrest her.In a continuing story arc, the relationship between Luther and Alice, two individuals with a twisted sense of morality, strangely evolves from adversarial, to a unique kind of friendship.  It's a weird transition that makes for an interesting fantasy, as Alice take an interest in John Luther's personal life, and his estranged wife Zoe (Indira Varma), who is living with another man.  Alice's intrusion, complicates what was already an emotionally charged situation.Dedicated to bringing criminals to justice, Luther is not adverse to bending the law, or outright breaking it, when he feels it is justified.  While allowances could be made for what he does in pursuit of ""justice"", other actions like covering up a murder, are less easy to excuse.  Luther is often a rousing and pulse-pounding drama, but one without much connection to reality.A highlight is definitely Episode 4, where man who drives a cab, is abducting and killing young women, then arranging the dead bodies on display.  It's been seen before, and the ending is not a complete surprise, but it's nicely presented, and bolstered by some excellent performances from Rob Jarvis as the killer, and Nicola Walker, as his wife.Series One comes to an explosive conclusion with Episodes 5 and 6, which have a connecting storyline.  A group of vicious thieves looking to recover some diamonds, are holding a woman hostage.  The situation is further complicated, because Luther's close friend is involved in the theft.  Things get very messy, innocents die, and Luther faces the darkest of tragedies.  Suspected of murder, and on the run, Luther enlists some unusual allies, as he attempts to clear his name.Journeying to some dark places, reality is out the door very early.  Some things may seem predictable, but the chances are that you will still want to see what happens, as Idris Elba's dynamic performance runs the emotional spectrum.  John Luther is an inscrutable fellow, highly intelligent but also impulsive, deceptive, and accustomed to employing violence as a solution.  He plays with fire, and sometimes gets very badly burned.  At the end, perhaps because he has so little left that he cares about, he's remarkably composed.The supporting cast, which also includes Dermot Crowley and Steven Macintosh, is top draw from top to bottom.  Sociopath Alice Morgan may be something of a genre clich&eacute;, but she is just one of several characters whose role evolves in a short period of time, an aspect that helps make the series interesting.  The Brits have had a taste for murder mysteries and gritty police procedurals for a very long time, and Luther makes a concerted effort to avoid being mundane.  For an American reference, if you are a fan of Criminal Minds, you may want to give Luther a look, particularly if you are a Prime member.",Positive
"There are just so many things that are wrong about this show.  I was expecting 30 Rock funny and sarcastic, not cute musical.  I couldn't believe they were serious with the music.  I thought, ""O.K. any minute they'll break and let us in on the music joke.""  But sadly they didn't.  Good voices but this was a mish mash of wrongness.",Negative
"PBS is known for solid and educational kids shows. This one is one of the best of the bunch (curious george being another solid series). fun to watch, it has very brief real life interactions between the kratts brothers and animals before and after each episode, then the episode itself is a cartoon involving the brothers and a certain animal.My kids pick up cool animal facts from this with every episode. I even find it memorable myself and easily fun to watch with the kids. It also has good replay value with the kids.If your kids love animals, they will love wild kratts. Thank you Kratt brothers.",Positive
It was not the worse of the lot. It was slightly amusing for a short time. It was almost too predictable. The plot needs work and the Kenny G young gun conductor bugged me to no end.  This show did not make me laugh.  I would not foresee myself watching many episodes of this.  The young oboe student seemed to be the most compelling character of the bunch.  I really don't want to see a poor rendition of Sex and the City.,Negative
"There's really nothing more to say.  I was hooked by the end of the first episode.  The writing was spectacular.  The acting was great.  And it had you craving more.  The worst part about the show was that it had to end.  If you&#8217;ve never seen the show, you definitely want to check it out.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed.",Positive
"I am so sorry it was not re-newed after 2 seasons. It was well written, a great cast, and thought provoking.",Positive

it's a weird show i haven't seen any advertisements for it it is one of those stories told in reverse but explanations do come it has only 3 episodes so far i like what i have seen so far this is could turn out to be a hidden gem of a show a diamond in the ruff so to speak i will see as the series progresses so it is worth checking out,Positive
"After reading the description and watching a clip, my first thought was, &#34;Do we really need another cop drama starring a rogue detective&#8230;&#34; Apparently, yes. We do! Bosch honestly caught me by surprise&#8212;it's different, and it is good. The show itself is a bit moody and noir, and hopefully future episodes keep that darkness while avoiding growing too cliche. The lead actor does an excellent job selling his character&#8212;the role seems to fit him like a glove. You can't help but wonder what movie or TV show you've seen him in before. Hopefully Amazon decides to go forward with this show.",Positive

"This is a very graphic story line that viewers should watch but be aware that there is lots of sexual and violence related graphics. It is however, very well done relating the story line without taking too much time in unnecessary (but there is some) sex scenes. Otherwise the graphic nature of the violence is the only other aspect to be aware of as it is not a normal t.v. show that holds back at some level. This show shows it all.... almost.That said, it is well done and worthy of watching all the same -- just go into it knowing that it will not hold anything back",Positive
"Bravo really needs to do better than this.  The three duds you brought on to replace Jill and Alex are just not working.  Please bring back Jill and Alex.  I never thought I would say this, but I am liking Ramona more and more and actually find her to be more trustworthy than anyone else on the show.  I do like LuAnn, but she is becoming too competitive, and I wish she would stop.  I find her, however, to be much more likable than the princess you brought on the show.  I think that Carole Radziwill is an accomplished person, but on this kind of program, she just does not work out well.  She is kind of boring.  I won't be watching next season, and I just got into the Real Housewives of New York, and found it interesting until this year.  Some of the Real Housewives shows are getting old, and this is one of them.",Negative

"INTO THE WHITE, also known as CROSS OF HONOR, is based on fact and in adapting the facts to the screen director Petter Nss along with co-writers Ole Meldgaard and Dave Mango have turned out a film that could easily have been a stage play, restricted for the most part as it is to the confines on one cabin. But then the vast beauty of the Norwegian landscape would have been sacrificed and it is that use of the bleak snow clad solitude that underlines the effects of isolation on the human response and survival under austere conditions.On April 27, 1940, while the Germans and the British were struggling to gain control of Norway's vast natural resource to aid their war efforts two enemy fighter planes were shot down over the tundra of Norway. We meet the German soldiers first - Lieutenant Horst Schopis (Florian Lukas), Feldwebel Wolfgang Strunk (Stig Henrik Hoff) and the wounded Unteroffizier Josef Schwartz (David Kross) as they struggle for survival, sleeping in snow caves and finally fining a deserted one room cabin where they settle in without much food and little comforts. Next we meet the British crew of the plane that crashed in the conflict with the Germans - Captain Charles P. Davenport (Lachlan Nieboer) and Gunner Robert Smith (Rupert Grint). The Brits find the German held cabin and join the Germans in a hostile relationship: there is a constant struggle of who is in charge, the Geneva convention rules of prisoners of war etc. But gradually the friction diminishes as the five men cope with finding food, warmth, and the care of Josef's arm, which has turned gangrenous. The facades of their military personalities fade into the unique personal needs of each and the result is an improbable friendship laced with angst, philosophy, humor, and mutual caring: in the end we are all equals and `enemies' morph into caring friends.As the credits role at film's end we are informed of the fates of each of the five men. The story is solid, touching, humorous at times, and carries a strong message about what war does to men's minds and It is only when isolated from the `badges of countries' that these unlikely men becomes bonded.  A very strong film. Grady Harp, April 13",Positive

"Ohmy. I used to think that the brand J.J. Abrams meant something good. Now I guess it means that he is being well paid to put his name behind even beyond bad products. Like this. There is not a single redeeming quality that excuses this disaster. The general plot is so bad, repetitive, and predictable as are the plots of each episode. Having a cute lovely child as main character doesn't do anything to mitigate the fact that the plot, the dialogues, and the acting are just terrible. Renegade group of scientists / good rebels help little paranormally gifted girl to escape from being used by mean scientist and government as a weapon. She is paired with a man wrongfully accused of murder, who is rescued from his own execution (an absolutely unnecessary ""plot twist"" -- faux pas really). This guy is her dad, which you know in about 5 seconds, but he is very very very slow and the only person in the universe for whom it takes a couple of terribly bad episodes to discover the obvious. And even though she controls minds and objects and reads situations and people and changes reality, they are utterly unable of doing anything decently well. Except, of course, being very, but very, really good samaritans (in case the blonde hair illuminated by an unsourced light was too sutil, you might need clues to understand that she is angelical). So, they escape all the time. The little angel and the wrongly persecuted criminal. None of whom should be in the acting career. Let's hope they catch them soon and put an end to our misery.",Negative
Love the stories. Best show on currently! When will season 5 start? Or is that it? It may have gone to syndication already.,Positive

"With ""Battlestar Galactica"" all wrapped-up, I was hurting for more hard core sci-fi! ""Caprica"" filled that gap until the season ended. Then to my surprise a new Stargate adopted the hardcore egde! I know that some people will hate this but I cant get enough. SGU starts out a bit slow and I think that's great.Early on the newly formed crew is desperately trying to find out where they are and what the hell happened! They learn that they're on a ship called Destiny very far away from earth. They must also find basic recources for survival but most of these people aren't trained SG military officers. Naturally lines are drawn and alliances are made. And like BSG and Caprica, no mercy is shown. There are military men and women with guns and more guns and there are civillians. They have no guns. Guess what happens when critcal life and death descisions need to be made and one side has guns and the other does not? Yeah - It gets ugly.As time goes on the crew finds a new star and planet that wasn't originally there back in the day. Some of the crew decide to stick around because they think who ever created the system will help them get back to earth! Really? Mabey these super-intelligent beings dont want filthy humans pissing on their brand new planet. Time will tell!...I love this kind of Ultra hardcore sci-fi. Im glad to see that the Stargate franchise went in this direction and I cant wait for season 2. Wether you like sci-fi or not this show is a great buy. It's the kind of show that's actually genre bending! Is it really sci-fi or is it drama? I had to ask myself that question about BSG. What do you think?UPDATE:The special features are top notch! It's all in HD and well put together. You get to see the actors behind the scenes as well as insight on the sets. There are also sit-down interviews with the actors, opposite the producer and creater, to discuss the psycology of their own character(s)! But for me seeing the actors outside of their charaters was eye opening. The most drastic difference was with Louis Ferreira. You quickly begin to understand just how good these people really are.UPDATE 2:It's been CANCELLED.",Positive
"This could have been a great show. But its not. What we get is a bunch of bikers presented as the defenders of small-town America. They get to be ""bad"" guys, but bad guys within real strict limits. Its another biker fantasy for rich guys in the suburbs. To undermine the premise even further they create real ""bad guys"" in the form of a white sumpremist gang hanging around the edges of things doing everything the ""good"" Bikers can't do.The show is also heavy on disfunctional family stuff taken right from the Sopranos. We have Jax Teller whose murdereded father apparently formed the gang as a utopian hippie experiment and would never have approved of the club running guns to make money. Jax spends half of every episode pouting about something. He just comes across as a total wuss.Ron Perlman has the presence to play the leader of the gang. But whatever presence he has is constantly undermined by Jax and the fact that every idea he has seems to fail or backfire. The show is at its best when Perlman is taking care of business for the club and showing how a small town like Charming works. Its at its worst whenever Jax gets whiny and they bitch at each other.Shows like this are good when everything is in shades of grey. When they show why someone like Clay makes the decisions he does and why idealism usually leads to trouble. But in Sons of Anarchy, Jax is always right and even if he takes a risk, it always pays off.One of the good things in the show are the law enforcement characters. There is far more realism in the show about them than the bikers.I really wanted to like this. And there were some things that I did really like. But the show is too tame and too much into biker fantasy.",Negative

To make the day worse for the emotional Charlie, a military cargo plane has crashed in London causing a power surge which has locked the place down. And oh yes, there is a 9 foot killer alien-predator on the loose in the same warehouse.This is a light weight predator/alien film. You do get to see the creature from about midpoint and the effects aren't bad. The group has to not only cope with fighting the alien, but must deal with hurt feelings as well as other people who pop into the script. Fairly decent sci-fi horror for those who have been going through withdraws since ""Prometheus"".Parental Guide: f-bomb. No real sex. Brief magazine nudity in beginning.",Positive
"I swear nothing original out of Hollywood in several decades. So you took the movie &#34;From Dusk Till Dawn&#34;, remade it, then split it up into several parts and made a TV series out of it!?

"Outstanding 1st season!I loved this show!Brian Cranston was hands down ""phenomenal"" as Walter White and easily deserved his Emmy. Aaron Paul is awesome in his role as Jesse Pinkman, and all the other cast members seemed to be a perfect fit.I knew the show was good, because of all the rave reviews, but I was'nt expecting it to be this good! ""Breaking Bad"" Season 1 has a 5 star overall rating here on Amazon.Great writing, great timing and development of the characters. The storyline is dramatic, hilarious and keeps you watching. Just when you think the story is starting to slow down, they nail you with something big!I watch alot of TV seasons on DVD (The Shield, CSI, Rescue Me), because I work at night. I haven't seen a show in its 1st season that was this good, since ""Dexter Sea. 1""!The only bad part about this show, was that the 1st season was only 7 episodes! Looking forward to the next season already!Highly, highly recommended!",Positive
"Jack's back. That should tell you all you really need to know. 24 has never been a real thinker of a show. This new series lifts the banner and waves it for all those who loved the original series.

If you enjoyed the older 24s, I can't imagine that you would dislike this one.",Positive

This is an exceptionally well done program. The actors and plot lines fit together into an intense and absorbing show.,Positive
"***Possible plot SPOILERS in the first paragraph***EUREKA, in its fifth and final season, still throws caution to the winds, still dares to redefine itself. The Season 4 finale closed with an edge-of-your-seat cliffhanger, as the deep space mission to Titan was sabotaged during launch and the Astraeus crew deployed to some unknown destination. Season 5 revolves mostly around the wayward Astraeus crew as, moments after the events in the Season 4 finale, they return to Earth to learn that four years had elapsed and things had changed alarmingly for the worse. And so cue the shuffling of status quo and the relationship shake-ups and the drastic shifts in personality.But the more things change, et cetera... Eureka remains the most dangerous hidden community on the planet, with its unending barrage of faulty scientific experiments. Sheriff Jack Carter (Colin Ferguson, consistently awesome), the genius town's dimmest resident, still races around Eureka, saving the day with his common man's heroics. Five seasons in, he remains our likable point-of-view character. Still, whenever the egghead discussion swivels to topics like smart dust and body printing, no one puts on a more amusing baffled expression than Colin Ferguson.So who will die? Who will tie the knot? Who lands the unexpected promotion? Who gets an impressively menacing  heel turn? And who is the mole? And what is Matrix Eureka? The Astraeus crew's return unveils a sinister conspiracy. As usual, things aren't what they seem. Gratifyingly, recurring guest star Felicia Day is featured heavily in these shady shenanigans. I love that this season exudes a whiff of THE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. EUREKA is most notably a lighthearted sci-fi show, rife with screwball moments, but it does often enough raise the stakes and adopt a darker tone. It's all the more telling when a sense of paranoia is injected. In Eureka, home to enthusiastic mad scientists, the most improbably terrifying things are very much achievable.EUREKA is hands down my favorite series on SyFy. It's too bad that, ultimately, its episodes proved to be too expensive to keep making. And I guess it's better to go out on a high note. Season 5 gives us plenty of strong episodes. The first three episodes - ""Lost,"" ""The Real Thing,"" ""Force Quit"" - had me chewing my nails. ""Jack of All Trades"" showcases Ferguson's knack for mimicry and physical comedy. In this one, Carter inadvertently swaps bodies with certain of the Astraeus crew (this is very awkward for those keeping deep, dark secrets). In maybe the series' most rewarding episode for fans of the Sheriff, ""Smarter Carter"" has Allison's highly critical genius brother dropping in for a visit just as Carter's I.Q. inexplicably expands (but at the cost of his humanity). It's so much fun to watch Carter spit out the multi-syllabic, hi-tech jargon. ""Mirror, Mirror"" and ""Double Take"" serve as the action-packed climax to the season-long Astraeus arc. In the farewell episode, ""Just Another Day,"" the DoD shuts down the Eureka project even as the town is rocked by unstable wormholes. Or, as the residents call it: Tuesday.I had such a fun visit in this town. And here I thought the Pacific Northwest was dull. And I think I'll hold Erica Cerra to her parting words in the DVD's bonus segment: ""We'll come back. A movie! I don't know!""EUREKA Season 5 comes with 3 discs and offers these bonus features:- Holiday Ep ""Do You see What I See?""- Deleted/Extended Scenes for 6 episodes- Gag Reel (00:02:50 minutes)- Anatomy of an Episode: ""Jack of All Trades"" - a behind-the-scenes look at the body swapping episode (00:17:04 minutes)- ""Ode to Carl the Jeep"" - clips featuring Sheriff Carter's work vehicle getting beat up (00:02:40 minutes)- ""This Song Is on the House"" - Tally Deushane on the ukelele singing about SARAH and Deputy Andy's A.I. romance (00:04:11 minutes)- ""A Fond Farewell"" - the cast and crew say thanks and goodbye (00:03:29 minutes)- Audio Commentary on ""Just Another Day..."" with co-creator/exec. producer Jaime Paglia and exec. producers Bruce Miller and Todd Sharp (in which we learn the plot trajectory of what would've been Season 6)",Positive
"I have become obsessed with this series. The solutions to the crimes are clever, interesting and well presented, and the romantic subplot is very well done.

Lie to Me: Season One Dvds. Good Delivery Time. Great Drama series.My husband wanted to see this after seeing two of the shows and we loved it!Amazon had great low prices and DVD in Perfect condition!,Positive
This movie tries too hard to be smart and witty but instead is just boring.  The rambling dialog of the man's best friend is especially irritating. The actors are supposed to be wildly in love with each other but never seem to pull off the illusion.  With such a great cast I thought this movie would be a good choice.  I was very disappointed.  Don't waste your time or $10 like I did.,Negative
I really enjoy this show. For me it is a great sci-fi show that handles the time travel genre very well. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good science fiction.,Positive
I finally watched this on Netflix this morning and loved it. It's not some big budget scare fest but the certain scenes they did show were scary and I loved that old inn a lot. I think it was the inn and the quirky girl innkeeper that won me over. I'm gonna buy it from Amazon now for a great blu ray price.,Positive

"This is a series which has a nice twist to the run of the mill hard guy private investigator series. The main character is Vincent, a former detective with Scottland Yard, who is your typical hard guy, chip on his shoulder, private investigator. But there is a twist, he is going through a rough personal crisis, losing the women he loves to another guy, which causes him all kinds of struggles through out each investigation. This twist makes him very human and makes the series different from the rest. If you enjoy both a good private investigator series and a good drama series, you will enjoy this series.",Positive
"This is a promising reboot of the Star Trek series, with the decided influence of JJ Abrams and friends. It's obviously hard to judge this one movie versus the existing Star Trek universe, but that's all we have for now.Skylar-Spock definitely stole the show as he was/is ideally suited to play a young Spock. Not quite as logical as Spock Prime - having an affair with a student is quite illogical after all. But as attempt #1 and playing a younger Spock one could not ask for a better performance.The rest of the characters need work in future movies before they establish themselves. New-Kirk was a bit too much 90210, New-Checkov was over-done with the geekery TNG-style, New-McCoy felt out of phase at times, and New-Sulu was not quite right. New-Uhura and New-Scottie are a step ahead of the rest of the main characters. Tyler Perry, talented and creative as he is, he was not very convincing as a high-ranking Star Fleet officer. It sort of stood out.The other issue with the movie is that the villain du jour was actually not particularly impressive considering the grand stage. Other than the scary-looking space-ship, this was a typical TNG villain. The best they could come up with was an angry miner with a mining ship destroying the galaxy?On the plus site, Abrams and Crew paid a lot of attention to a number of details from the original Star Trek universe, mini-homages to fans of TOS. Also very nice is the very efficient way they split the JJ Abrams Trek into a new timeline/reality, thus not risking the wrath of TOS fans. This clean-cut also opens up the possibility of more ""visitors"" from the original Trek timeline/reality in future movies without ""ruining"" TOS :)",Positive
"Here is my one thing about D.Benson she hasn't gotten any better at her job. I feel like she wants to be on the up and up, but every time there is a new show, she is with some guy that she really shouldn't be with (the Lawyer, the undercover cop) they she doesn't disclose. So her whole purpose of trying to keep a relationship secret gets totally blown up and out in the open. Also I definately notice that she is a little more calm through out the activities, but I don't feel like she nows that law well enough to manipulate it to her advantage. I really like Hargitay, but I just wish she would grow up a little.I like the stories. They are what keep me interested I just wish that they would keep the characters more mature like.",Negative
"First, no television show could possibly recreate for viewers exactly how things are inside an OMC (outlaw motorcycle club). I think that SoA goes as far as it can in the re-creation but then, by necessity, stops. An example of that would be how the family atmosphere inside Samcro is overly sugar coated in some scenes. On the other hand, showing the sweeter side of the club members is essential to developing their characters. How well that is done may be reflected in the eventual success or failure of this show.Sons of Anarchy is good entertainment if you aren't too picky about occasional scenes that are just plain vulgar. You'll also have to be able to tolerate characters such as Tig, who is being revealed bit-by-bit as a more complicated character than many viewers would have suspected earlier in the season. I cannot forget or forgive that was Tig who said, ""No wonder I beat up hookers,"" when he was feeling exasperated by Gemma. But it seems the real threat from him isn't to hookers, it is the level of resistance he has against Jaz's attempts to legitimize the club. That may show an even darker side of Tig than we have already seen.I can't wait until next season!! By the way, in case you don't know, each episode of SoA is available for purchase for less than $2 here on amazon.",Positive

"I love British television. Inspector Lewis, and Sgt Hathaway, are two of the best characters I have seen.  With each new season they have become more and more real, like two friends I want to hear how their day went.  Kevin Whately has done a wonderful job of growing his character from sidekick to star; a leader with a disarming folksy charm.  The bad guys just don't see him coming because they don't think he is a threat.  Laurence Fox plays Hathaway like you would expect some one to play a valuable violin; every note is perfect.  In each episode Hathaway is revealed in a slightly different way, but it feels like you are just gradually getting to know him.  Great characters.  Great stories.  This one makes me want to beg for more.",Positive
"""Europa Report""(Magnet, 2013). . .This low-budget sci-fi film is at the cusp of today's scientific horizons - a speculative journey to Jupiter's moon, Europa, an apparently volcanic, ice-bound planetoid with vast subterranean oceans that is currently one of the most promising destinations in the search for extraterrestrial life. The action centers around a small crew on a manned flight that will take nearly two years to arrive in Jupiter's orbit - experts in their fields, they are challenged by relentless isolation, monotony and interpersonal tensions, especially after a solar flare cripples their communications equipment and cuts them off from all contact with Mother Earth.Naturally, this film begs for comparison with the glitzy, melodramatic, mass-marketed 3D blockbuster, ""Gravity,"" a popcorn film that became a contender for the Oscar's Best Film category. But where ""Gravity"" has a bigger budget (for both production and promotions), its vision is essentially small, fearful and earthbound. Space is big and scary, it says, we humans are small and overly bold. ""Europa,"" on the other hand, dreams big -- it flings us into the void, dread mixing with exhilaration and awe. This is a film that looks forward into an era of exploration and evolution, which sees humans moving tentatively into a void that is not empty, merely vast, untamed and unpredictable. It may take a while for viewers to get onto this film's wavelength, but the low-rent ""Blair-Witch-in-outer-space"" vibe slowly gives way to an engrossing world that holds its own internal logic, and is genuinely suspenseful and convincing in a way the over-the-top, peril-strewn ""Gravity"" is not.""Europa Report"" is much closer in spirit to the opening chapters of Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Red Mars,"" exploring the psychological tensions of space flight, and the tenacity it takes to overcome these challenges. It's not a perfect film, by any means, but it is very good and speaks truly to our times. As society and politics fester and stagnate here on Earth, the stars seems to shine brighter and beckon more clearly, pulling us towards a future that is, perhaps, expansive and bold, and will certainly be bigger and more surprising than we can imagine. Outer space is our new frontier, and we have only just begun to meet the challenge. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",Positive
"With Season 6 we find Shane in a conundrum over happenings from Season 5.  To make matters worse, Shane and Vic are at odds.The writing is still tight but the camaraderie between the Strike Team is very, VERY loose.  In the end, Vic and Aceveda form an alliance that benefits each other -- for the time being.Even though at this point the series has run the gamut and is heading for an end, it is still 'must see' viewing.  Like a soap opera of life unfolding in front of your face, The Shield and Farmington Division are part of an effort for FX to provide very sharp work to the masses.Great job to those folks who were believers of the network before it had a chance to fold.",Positive

"Shooting is inherently boring. Other shooting shows like 'Sons of Guns' finish each episode with a shooting demo. But they always have a successful hit punctuated with a huge orange fireball explosion. Trust me. Shooting not like that. If I hit the bulls eye I find out by looking at a tiny round hole in a piece of paper.Top Shot has always had the best production values. They film and direct their shooting competition so as to extract the maximum amount of suspense and drama.But last season their backstory almost swamped the whole show. They also had teams who lived together and interacted when not on the firing range. But they included a crazy guy last season who tried to pick fist fights, who kept everyone else awake at night and who would employ any underhanded ploy to gain an advantage. He was black which lent a racial element to the proceedings. The whole thing was hard to watch.This season they have cut down on the dormitory psychodrama and emphasized the shooting.Good!",Positive

"Four-and-a-half stars, actually - but Amazon won't let you do half-stars.I loved STRUCK BY LIGHTNING. Starring Chris Colfer (Kurt from ""Glee"") - who also wrote the screenplay - the film starts off with a bang, literally, when high school senior Carson Phillips (Colfer) is struck dead by lightning within the first half-minute of the film. The rest of the film, told in flashback and narrated by Carson himself, depicts the highly intelligent social outcast as he struggles valiantly to get his staff to write for the school newspaper, even as he eagerly awaits word from Northwestern University - the only college he's wanted to attend since childhood, to pursue writing - so he can finally get out of the tiny town of Clover, where he has spent his entire life. And when he's told by a guidance counselor to start an on-campus literary magazine, to better get Northwestern's attention for their writing program, fate hands Carson a brilliant idea.Like any nerdling whose been picked on one too many times, Carson finally fires back - by getting dirt on every big shot in the school, then blackmailing each and every one of them to write a submission for his magazine. Incurring more hatred from his classmates doesn't matter - with a no-show father, a mother (played brilliantly by Allison Janney) addicted to booze and painkillers, and being surrounded by people with no ambition or dreams beyond the Clover city limits, Carson's blinders are fully on to escape.The film's message is so - SO - much deeper than you'd think; please watch this film with your brain fully engaged for full effect. This is a film about dreams, and how even those of us with the brightest of dreams may never make those dreams come true; the odds, frankly, are stacked against us. And yet, the film remains refreshing, positive, and inspiring. As I said, I loved it.",Positive
"I purchased the Go, Diego, Go! series for my granddaughter!  She watches it on our Kindle, and is very interactive with the stories.  As a toddler, she learns  problem solving skills, names of many animals, compassion for them as well.  She simply enjoys the music, action, and the vivid colors.  Go, Diego Go! is not only entertainment for your little ones, it's a learning process as well.  I would recommend it to all parents, grandparents who are looking for something special for their children! Two thumbs up!!!",Positive
Love this show!  Liberal lacings of humor and really excellent actors make this series about a wildcard US Marshall in Harlan Kentucky a joy to watch.,Positive
Definitely my favorite show on TV!Love this show! The way Longmire says soo little and yet soo much ...wonderfully acted.,Positive
"If you want a realistic FBI &#34;Who Done It&#34;, don't watch this,  This is a very hilariously entertaining 45 minutes of entertainment with a delightful cast of characters.  We have trouble limiting ourselves to a single episode a night and will be sad when we finish the series.",Positive
The second season gets a little too far away from Earl's list and onto some unrelated adventures but still a lot of fun.,Positive
I love the underwater scenes.  They make beautiful mermaids. They solve problems that young people have but it's for everyone.,Positive
"Hate paying for each episode, and hope Netflix picks this up. But this is one of several shows I pay for and what are you going to do when you don't get that cable channel?",Positive
"Why is it that this military team acts with the tactical awareness of a box of puppies.The show has heart, a great premise, and occasional flashes of creativity, but they assault the viewer with aggressively-stupid character actions on a regular basis.  Thank Ra there's a fast forward.",Negative
My favorite season by far. There is so much more depth to everyone and the backstory for each character is incredible.,Positive
"Really like the series. THe cast and their characters make for an enjoyable 40 minutes. It's a little light on the police and detective work intentionally, and instead showcases the characters and their interactions with just enough light humor .",Positive
"David Suchet, is aging, and better... But I miss Ms. Lemon... and Det. Jap... the Series is wonderful.. and this is Definately Agatha Christie at her best",Positive
I love the fact it introduces different art forms to children and allows for ctafts but i think it is a show older children  will enjoy(4&up)why it might lose the attention span of younger ones. I liked thw concept but i got bored wayching it.,Negative
The concept of this show was great but the writing didn't measure up. I liked the cast but again the characters seemed very superficial. It almost seemed like the writers couldn't be bothered to do any heavy-lifting. It's too bad because it could have been a wonderful series.,Negative
"I give this five stars because not only is this series funny, but it is insightful into the nature of governments and bureaucracies.  While this show is poking fun at the British government, it would be easy to envision something quite similar in Washington.",Positive
"Season 10, they killed off some of the supporting cast, and that didn't bode well for the whole Israeli set of plot devices.Come Season 11, and I don't think it's a secret Zhiva David(sp?) is gone, secretarty of the navy gone, a lot of house cleaning and nothing backfilling it at the moment.I can certainly understand and sympathize with the process, but take too long doing it and you risk losing you audience as you come out with a lot of filler... Hour long sessions of sweeping the floor.Coupled with the amazing body count the cast has racked up over the year (stretching believability), and... well, I dunno at this point it's like hospicing a friend with Alzheimer's.  You focus on the good memories and there are still moments, but it's getting thinner and thinner all the time.Add on that they are going to throw in a 2 episode New Orleans based &#34;spin-off&#34; episode to this season and you have to think they're running out of gas or at least need to refocus on their audience and start delivering again.",Negative
"I loooove this season! Although I did really like the old staffers, the new staff is more mellow and theyre all sweet, relateable people who are easy on the eyes. Patti seems more relaxed now that shes in a steady relayionship - good for her.  Also, you're 52?! Damn, girl, you look good!  Impressed that Patti did not lie about her age. Enjoying the dates too, how sweet is Don Swayze - aww.",Positive
"I thought this show was very entertaining.  The story is original.  It has elements of comedy, action and drama.  Now, if only there were more!",Positive
"Prison Break returns for its fourth and final season, a season filled with the kind of high-octane action and wonderful characters that this show is known for. Prison Break is one of the best shows FOX has aired in a long time, and it was sad to see it go.The season opens with Michael (Wentworth Miller) tracking down Mahone (William Fichtner), Whistler (Chris Vance), and Gretchen (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) to avenge the death of his beloved Sara (Sarah Wayne Callies). However, once he finds Gretchen, the truth isn't what it originally seemed. Partial secrets are revealed, and a mysterious new player appears.Soon after, Michael and Lincoln (Dominic Purcell) are pursued by a Homeland Security agent, who wants to blackmail them into doing his dirty work for him. Michael and Lincoln agree to the agent's demands. The majority of the season then tells about the intricate operation they work on for the agent, and Michael and Lincoln's attempt to avoid being returned to prison.The show slowly grows to a thrilling climax, where many familiar Prison Break faces return. However, Michael's story doesn't end as perfectly as many fans would have liked.Every performance this season is amazing, as it is in the previous seasons. The characters leap off the screen with their lush, realistic feel. Every actor in this show completely embodies their character.  Miller is a hard-edged, driven actor who draws you into the character's world. His chemistry with Purcell is amazing. The two characters show strong bonds of brotherhood and help get another through the crazy happenings in their lives.This DVD set includes a decent collection of extras, such as two featurettes on the series and its ending and commentary soundtracks for some of the episodes. While I really enjoyed the commentary tracks that exist, it would be far better to have them on all the episodes. I know that there are 22 episodes here, but surely there could be more commentary for the final season? It is also a little surprising that there aren't any deleted or extended scenes from the season. Really, that's part of the reason for getting your favorite TV shows on DVD -- to see more of what was originally filmed for each episode.The biggest issues I have with this release is actually the packaging. I know that sounds a little picky, but the transparent, thin plastic seems cheap and tacky to me -- not to mention it doesn't seem like it will protect the discs very well in the long term. Of course, this new packaging does make the set considerably thinner and lighter, but I somewhat miss the look and feel of the older packaging styles (call me old-fashioned).Season four of Prison Break didn't make every fan happy -- in fact, some fans thought that the series should have ended after the third season. I think that this season was a good ending to the series, filled with edge-of-your-seat intensity, and amazing performances.  I definitely recommend it.",Positive
One of the best Lawyer shows ever! Everyone should watch Suits! Can't wait for the next season to be available.,Positive
"This was very well done. When I saw the page with the five pilots, it's the one I definitely wanted to see first, and I like what I saw.We need quality science-fiction series, and sadly there are so few of them out there, so it's great to see Chris Carter getting back to business with what I hope Amazon will order as a series, it certainly has potential for it.As a Frenchman, I was surprised and delighted to see that the main role - or certainly the one that stands out the most as the central figure in the group - is played by a French actress, Louise Monot, whom I had very much enjoyed in 'OSS 117: Rio ne r&eacute;pond plus' (a cult French comedy). She is pretty great in this as well, as are all the other cast members (always nice to see Adrian Pasdar), whose characters are well defined already, there is no weak link.The hour flew by and I want more. I assume Chris Carter will have carte blanche to delve into a complex story without the restraints he might have had on a broadcast network. And if it's done right, I think a show like The After has the DNA to put Amazon on the map regarding original series.",Positive
"I love the recreations, they are movie quality and very creepy.  My favorite episode is the Wolfman, Dogman episode but all of them are good.",Positive
I think the acting is brilliant....and the characters they play are interesting. This is more of a phsycological detective show which never shows graphic viiolence...it leaves a lot for the imagination and keeps you wondering. I think the Sherlock series was better but this one comes close...,Positive
"Last Man Standing is the best!!  Tim Allen is so great at creating good, funny, family entertainment!!  I love all the actors and the characters they've become on the show!  Great chemistry between the actors as well!  I wish there was a lot more sitcoms like this, that don't base there whole show on sex related jokes, humor and innuendos!  Love this show, so glad to see Tim Allen back doing what he does best!!",Positive
"There's a lot of potential for this show, but the siblings in this show are not relatable to those outside the state of California. There has to be a relatable character when there's a cast this big, More importantly if we are to find any way to relate to transgenderism, we need a relatable character on the outside looking in.",Positive
I like this tv show because there is a great story line in each episode. They find and catch the perp and prosecute them. I have all the seasons.,Positive
"A-A-ron, white p/black v, and slave auction (trust me-social satire) are hilarious! There are fillers with them talking to the audience which are hit or miss. No all the skits are great, some go on too long, but most will make you laugh out load. Hopefully SNL will finally take the hint from this show and not rely on white Canadians doing impressions all the time or stars who cannot read and act at the same time.",Positive
Good,Negative
"WIP flicks are what they are. They nearly (nearly) transcend criticism because they are a hard and fast genre requiring certain obligations to be fulfilled. This one tries to skirt some of those obligations.Here's the scoop. A handful of female inmates are granted a 2 day pass to the outside to see if they can re-assimilate into society (right). This follows them on their attempts.Other than Uschi Digard and Candy Samples I didn't know any of these actresses (actresses?). The schtick here is to get the girls out of the prison with the 2 day pass scenario. It opens with the obligatory shower scene and ensuing cat fight and is followed up with the girls visiting the prison psychiatrist as to why this 2 day pass can do them well. We then see how each uses the pass which amounts to little more than one sex scene after another.Yup. Cheap sets. Bad acting. Bad writing. Bad directing. But we're not here for that. We want the babes and there are babes aplenty. Problem is, everything is so bad the bare babes become tiresome after little time. Sex scenes, even soft core sex scenes, can be arousing. Not so here. They wear out their welcome pretty quick. The real highlights are seeing Uschi and Candy and even those left me wanting.There are a lot of these kinds of flicks out there and most (maybe all) are better than this one. Seek them out first",Negative
"Okay it is the end of the world blah, blah, blah!  The episode kind of dragged until the end.  That is why I gave it four stars rather than five.  The ending is sooooo very cool!  I don't want to give it away, but I will say I really hope we get to see many more episodes!!!!!!  Enjoy!!",Positive
"Like the chartersStories are believable if you like scfiWish there were more seasons, just started to really get to know the whole plot",Positive
Having once lived in Unalakleet this show is extra special. It shows the wild side of Alaska and the great people that live there. Its a show my husband and I can enjoy together. Keep them coming.,Positive
"WELL MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND WONT STOP ASKING TO WATCH IT. IT HAS A REAL WAY OF SHOWING KIDS HOW EVEN WHEN YOU ARE FRIENDS YOU WILL FIGHT BUT THEN MAKE UP. LIFE WORKS OUT. I LOVE THE OLD WWAY ABOUT IT. KIDS OUT PLAYING USING THEIR IMAGINATION, WHAT MORE COULD YOU GET FROM A BEAR.",Positive
I love this show. The characters and acting are both excellent. I especially like the relationship between Raylan and Boyd. When they are on screen it is usually some of the shows best moments.,Positive
"Creative movie that leaves you wanting more!It looks like a cheap indie film, but is actually quite good.Apparently you have to be smarter than the average monkey to follow ;)",Positive
"What can I say?  I really was expecting more from a series that had Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy in it.  I love both of those actors and I'm a big fan of E.A. Poe, so I really was looking forward to this.  Unfortunately, I was unimpressed.",Negative
"the always excellent Dennis quaid finally moves into a tv series, after decades of leading man roles it was bound to happen and it happened in a good way! With this solid tv show that returns viewers to a long ago vegas where the mafia really had alot of influence , they actually didn't control most of the casinos , they did control some of them though. Michael chiklis is a fine villian and this is almost as good as the 1980's tv show that michael mann did. The show is a hit show and for good reason , it's just a solid show with a solid storyline and exceptional film quality in cgi and studio set recreations. A++.",Positive
"A surprise for those of us not growing up in London. To know these episodes are based on real stories makes watching each episode almost unbelievable, but the interest is still there. Nurses had such a struggle working in a crowded hospital. Doctors, who made little to no salary, are a variety of good and indifferent. I hope there are many more seasons.",Positive
"Like the series, there are only season 1 & 2 available, for some reason season 3 is not shown on Prime.  Good solid acting, different stores, more from the rural areas and not the big city crime.It's worth a watch, enjoy.",Positive
"Apparently this movie is based on a true story. It is a depressing story and one that in my opinion,did not need to be told.",Negative
I enjoyed the first season so much I couldn't wait until the second season to start. I hope there is just as much action as there was last season. surprise me!,Positive
I remember watching some episodes of this show on PBS some years ago and liked it then.  I only saw a small percentage of the total.  When I found it on Amazon Prime I started watching it from the beginning and have gotten hooked on it this time.  It helps seeing the episodes from the beginning.  You get a better understanding of the relationship.  It is well worth watching.,Positive
"Life was tough in Five Corners for all dwellers. If you liked &#34;Gangs of New York&#34;, you will like this series.",Positive
"If you hate the gop & any thoughts that are not left of center..this is your show. Don't we get enough of that on abc, nbc and cbs? Disappointing Amazon. Love you guys...this is beneath you.",Negative
"This show is about the characters in the story as much or more than it's about the plot.  This in spite of the fact that it is, in some places, a bit more sympathetic to the main Soviet characters.  You can't help routing for them as they continue their killing spree of those who get in the way of their schemes.  On the other hand, you want them to get caught, because they are the bad guy misled and brainswashed on an evil agenda.  So you wind up rooting for both sides.  Meanwhile, the direction and cinematography are outstanding.  It's just a really well done show with excellent story writing.",Positive
Quality show and safe and fun entertainment for the whole family.  There are not many shows out there that you can say this about.  A & E had better keep with this show or another network will have no trouble scooping them up into their line up. :),Positive
"I was shocked. Didn`t even finish it.It was mind-blowingly shallow and infantile.Only FOX could ruin something as great as the original PB.Never in TV history have I witnessed a descent like thisfrom excellence with Season One to foolishness in Season Four.Only watch season one and forget they ever made 2,3 & especially 4",Negative
Glades is an enjoyable watch because the actors play interesting characters and do it well. The surprising thing is that after watching 4 shows I now know how to fully predict each story. The writer's formula is overly simplistic and repetitive.  Humor saves most scenes and in the middle of a weak thread we get to like the main characters and actually care about them. There just needs to be a bit more intrigue and mystery than currently exists.  We'll see how the seasons develop.,Negative
"First, the second takes of the principals exchanging incredulous glances becomes very old, very quickly. At times the possible danger of a situation seems exaggerated. Most episodes do not hold my attention of very long.",Negative
"If you expect somebody, maybe even the heroine, to sit down for a moment and explain what is going on, who is who, why do they do what they do, you will wait in vain. On top of that, apart from Scarlet's alien, everybody speaks Scottish, and there are no subtitles.What you get is much bad weather, much rough scenery, a beautiful woman hunting men and mysteriously disposing of them, some guys on motor bikes who seem to be the clean up crew ... To quote Monty Python: what does it mean?The woman experiences some kind of mind change, she seems to run away. From what?That's when some of the most romantic scenes happen. See for yourself.Some people were bored and left. I couldn't do that, the imagery was too compelling, and I kept up the hope to understand it, maybe. Maybe somebody does. It certainly doesn't quite fit our normal movie viewing experience.",Positive
"The movie never developed a ""feeling"" for the characters, wasnt very scary, wasnt a well made movie in any manner and is so forgetable I had to click on it to remember the basic plotline....what little there was of it.I dont recommend this movie......at all",Negative
Never heard of this show before coming across it on Prime. Really enjoy it and hope there are more seasons to come.,Positive
"Though I was captivated by the series right from the start, as the seasons progressed it only became more engrossing. I thought that Season Three really took off, and felt that anything attempted beyond that would be a let down. Alas! Season 4 tops them all for the depth of presented ideas, characterization, and adrenalin raising action.THough there were, I believe, 77 episodes in the series, as I approached the final episodes I felt a close friend was packing and departing from me. Then, in keeping with that feeling of loss, the final episode brought, I thought, the reality of life for us all to the center, and that is exactly how any production that &#34;holds the mirror up to nature&#34; as well as this series did should have ended. Magnificent! The finest video production I have ever experienced.",Positive
"Well written and well acted.  Great cast!  Interesting, but slightly disturbing, relationships.  A little dark, but I would tune in to see what happens next between the gay daughter and the trans-dresser dad.",Positive
"I never thought I would see another movie or series that I would like regarding Sherlock Holmes.  When I first caught an episode of Elementary, I got hooked and between each episodes storyline and the characters evolving, I can't wait for each new episode to be released.  Having made Dr Watson a woman in this program was a unique but very welcomed change.  Unlike Nigel Bruce who kind of played a more bumbling character, Lucy Loo is quickly rising to Holmes' level.",Positive
"I have been an I Love Lucy fan since I was a child.  It used to be on in reruns almost constantly each day and I remember loving it then as I do now.  It is nice to be able to watch the episodes here on Amazon and enjoy them all over again.  Lucille Ball was a comic genius, and I defy anyone to watch an episode and not laugh.  Although the shows are over 50 years old, the situations remain viable today, the same problems between husband and wife or friends and neighbors.  It is a true classic that stands the test of time and will probably always be shown as an example of what comedy should be!",Positive
Oh I am definitely hooked. I have been watching since the very first episode..I even got my mom and friends hooked on watching these fiesty maids.,Positive
"This felt pretty average to me. It managed to get a few laughs, but I pretty much forgot about is as soon as it ended. The thing is, it's too much like several other shows/movies out there, ""Workaholics,"" ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" ""The Hangover,"" and for some reason it also reminds me of ""Horrible Bosses."" Basically three screw ups with crap jobs doing horrible things throughout the show. Been there done that. Instead of doing something unique, it's just cashes in on an already saturated genre.",Negative
We sing many of the songs we've learned from here throughout the day. My son loves to see what adventure they will go on enxt.,Positive
"Okay. It's a new year so I can have a new WSF (Worst So Far), although I'm sure there will be even worse as the year goes on. As a rule, I find most clich&eacute;d situations to be diverting, but not the groaners in this thing. I'm sure the gales of laughter that met the finale were NOT what the director had in mind! (To be fair, sometimes a screening audience IS a tough sell.)Director Paul W.S. Anderson (&#34;The Three Musketeers&#34;) specializes in Computer Generated Imaging, so this actioner contains no surprises, but this bloodbath piled cruelty upon cruelty: lashings, bashings, smashings and slashings, so I kept my eyes covered and my yawns smothered much of the time. How many ways can they draw blood or cause mental anguish? (One couple actually brought a toddler. Okay, no profanity, so no harm.....)These folks have had better roles, but they give it their best:* Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (&#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34;) has our sympathy as the gladiator promised his freedom if he wins his last fight. Yeah... right...* Kit Harington (&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;) is our hero, a Celt with uncommon fighting skills, enslaved by Roman soldiers since childhood. Of course it's love at first sight when our heroine makes her entrance.* Emily Browning (&#34;Sucker Punch&#34;) is that puffy-lipped heroine. She is betrothed (unwillingly) to a Roman senator by her less-than-courageous father.* Jared Harris (&#34;Mad Men&#34;) is that father, who apparently backed the wrong politician and now has to make amends to the current powers that be.* Carrie-Anne Moss (&#34;Vegas&#34;) is his wife. At least she can see the political scene clearly, although there is very little she can do about it.* Kiefer Sutherland (Lots of TV) is the dastardly senator from Rome who lusts after our heroine and wants to invest in real estate in our fair city. (Pompeii was considered a resort town by the Romans.)No fight is worth watching unless there are insurmountable odds (which of course our hero surmounts) and lots of blood. And we only HEAR him break that horse's neck....I don't remember archaeologists mentioning a tsunami, do you? I thought it was pyroclastic (searing) blasts and ash-fall from Mount Vesuvius that killed the good folks in Pompeii. This morning I contacted someone who toured Pompeii and never heard a word about a tsunami. By the way, the plaster casts we associate with Pompeii were created when archaeologists injected a substance into the hollows in the solidified ash which were left after corpses decomposed.Expect lots of swordplay, spear thrusts, fist fights, earthquakes, a volcanic eruption, and a tsunami. Only one chaste little kiss though, and no sweaty bodies (PG-13). Whew!",Negative
"My favorite ""Mountain Man"" of all is Eustace Conway in North Carolina. He truly lives off the land and uses primitive means that he contrives himself.Tom Oar in Montana puzzles me: his wife was concerned for her safety with the grizzlies and the wolves coming onto the premises and Tom was going to be away selling their crafts. His solution? Bring out ""The Gun"" and teach her how to use it. Just what was ""The Gun""? A single shot break-action .410 shotgun! He must have been thinking ""well, at least I have her well-insured!"" Any ""Mountain Man"" knows that a .410 would be no more effective against large predators than a BB gun and firecrackers.Marty in Alaska is a pessimist if I ever saw one. Perhaps with good reason though. Murphy's Law rules the roost of his home! He does seem to take unnecessary risks that in my mind, will eventually catch up to him thus fulfilling his pessimistic outlook.I do like this series! Eustace is the only one I would ever consider as a mentor. He is resourceful, tough, and a man I can (and do) respect.",Positive
"While this series hasn't reached the level as its predecessor overall the series does grow in entertainment and quality per episode, especially as we get some screen time with some of the other background characters in the series as well.  While the Wraith remain the primary enemy on the series we also get some intrusion from past enemies as well from G'aould to the Replicators as well as some cameo time from some of the SG1 team members too.  While Shepard is no Jack O'Neill he has started getting his own personality it seems that fits the series well and while the super model leader Teyla still feels unneeded she has become somewhat less annoying in the series as well.  If you have the Stargate series I say for the price these sets are going for that it's a pretty good bargain to add the five seasons of Stargate Atlantis to the shelf as well....",Positive
"For the millions who are still fascinated by their phenomenon, this secretary constantly had them autograph items and dictate official fanclub letters from 1962 until 1974.  The sincerity of her smile and the warmth of her eyes both in old photos and new interviews suggest an intimate friendship with all four Beatles and many of their parents.  Ringo even videotapes a personal thanks to Freda for being so loyal.  There aren't many new facts, but you get a unique insider's perspective on how close the band members were to each other in the early years and how far they had drifted apart by the time their manager died.  It's definitely a humanistic observation rather than a musical one.",Positive
"This is a good movie to rent if you were into the series like I was. I'm not sure how the producers thought this was a good idea for the big screen. For people who had no clue about the series did not get any back story on the characters who participated in the movie verses the series and why.....It is like picking back up although 10 years later straight from the series....leaving out the cliff hanger from the last season though. For those who did not see the series, I'm not sure will get much from the movie other than, &#34;hey, this would be a good tv series&#34; which it would!",Negative
"Buy the first 4 seasons, rent the 5th season.  Not very good -- terrible scripts.",Negative
Very interesting to see the methods different people use to PREPARE for the day the SHTF.  Though this series a family could get some great ideas to incorporate into their own prudent preparation for emergencies or the SHTF day.,Positive
"This series has potential.  I am really rooting for these guys.  I'd like to see where they go with it.  I'm also from Silicon Valley, so I'm totally biased.",Positive
"I  enjoy watching both actors the direction they are taking the show, their imput as directors and how they work well together. Of course the other actors ALL work very well together.",Positive
"I wanted to love this one, the cast has good potential, but for some reason, that I can't really put into words well, I just did not find this pilot funny enough to hold my attention all the way through. If you like Jeffrey Tambor in general I think you will be ok with this show.",Negative
"This show started out (to me), somewhat slow & confusing, but than the more I watched it, the more I liked it ~ trying to figure out what was going on & what the actors/characters were doing at the moment & would do in the future. Some of the killings really caught me off guard. I am really looking forward to Season 2.",Positive
"Love this show, it's smart, funny, serious and enjoy the intricate plots.  Just when you think there is no way out, a tactful and smart outcome is just around the corner.  It's also at times realistic enough to accept a loss and justify it as the best outcome.",Positive
"Thank goodness for Amazon Instant. I had started watching THE BRIDGE  season 1, but missed several episodes., so before season 2 began, I was able to re-watch & catch up. The series is extremely well written & acted.",Positive
It had a few jumpy moments but we never figured what the pact was and who made it. It just wasn't that good. The acting was sub par especially for who the actors were.,Negative
They are brave people and have come a long way in the past 2 years. As long as they remain a family and remember what is truly important.,Negative
"This show is freaky.  I didn't get as many nightmares as the first season.  It's a solid, entertaining show.  If you like the Haunted House, you'll probably like Asylum.",Positive
"Sure, we have the creators of this show that came up with the concept and, to be sure, there are the characters that bring the show to life... but who really have the brains overall? Believe it or not, even though they're total brainiacs, it's not Sheldon or his totally egotistic roommate Sheldon (who has issues galore), I do believe it's their blonde neighbor, Penny, who definitely knows how to portray common sense effectively. And in each episode, where misadventures fire up all the time, I couldn't help but laugh my jaw off at each antic, especially the failed tactics of the live person counterpart of Pepy Lepew- Howard Horowitz. Almost felt like I needed a death certificate for laughing so hard each time.As for Sheldon's attitude and cold, distant, nonpersonal way... I laughed real hard at what happens to him at the Physics Bowl (who would've guessed a janitor could actually be smart?). Not to mention Rajesh finding a way to actually talk to women (make that two, though I don't think the side effects will be wanted), oh, and can't forget Leslie Winkler and her forward, somewhat off-putting, yet very well-done character as the female version of the guys. And the chemistry between Leonard and Penny may be obvious, but it also works, very, very well. It's not blaring, it works equally with all the nerdish humor- his intelligence and awkwardness with her charm and ditziness. And if this is just the start-up, then let the bigger laughs begin when I get to season 2.",Positive
"I thought this show had an original plot that was quite intriguing. It's a detective show with an underlying conspiracy, and a main character that has trouble distinguishing reality from his dream world, with both worlds seeming to influence the other. I liked the cast, as well. Too bad is seems to be discontinued.",Positive
"Since we have the other seasons on DVD I bought this on DVD not Blue-Ray. We loved this show but I do think they were smart in ending it when they did. Overall, I'm glad we have this just to have the complete series. I liked season 4 better but did enjoy this season as well.",Positive
"First of all very well produced. And the lead is wonderful and natural. But I still feel as if I've been there done this before. Wish I could see a show with older characters, more depth and more minorities in stronger roles.Are all people on Earth into drugs, casual sex , and fragile egos? Maybe that's what the writers and creators know and are familiar with. The first key to writing is write what you know. So with that in mind, I am sure there is an ongoing audience for this material.But it does not seem as original as &#34;Orange is the New Black&#34; or &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; But it is by far wayyyyyyyy better than Amazon's &#34;Alpha House.&#34;I am not a huge fan of classical music but I do enjoy it. So I enjoyed the show for that reason alone.I think the Amazon team might be better served producing dramedies with an hour long format that will give it time to develop story, plot and characters a bit more. And perhaps introduce some truly new voices to the process. Sure it's nice to have &#34;big names&#34; on board to promote a new venture. But with the big names comes to same old, old stuff, sensibilities and ideas.Let's shake things up a bit more and TRULY bring something new to the table.",Negative
I have been a fan of the show for years and would watch any of the seasons. This one is just as good as the rest.,Positive
"I was sad to see the Closer end, but this show,""Major Crimes"" can hold its own and each week it gets better.",Positive
This show always has at least a few really great gags. I find myself laughing out loud (even one time in the airport while waiting for my plane...pretty embarrassing but unavoidable!). The ensemble is very good.,Positive
"I love this show. I grew up in the 1980's decade. Yes, I remember the COLD WAR with Russia, which they were once called the U.S.S.R. or the &#34;Soviet Union.&#34; I remember coming across the Russian &#34;super&#34; spies, who lived and &#34;acted&#34; like they were Americans, but they were actually Russian nationalist during my college years. I love the characters: Philip and Elizabeth. They are my favorite, which is the reason I enjoyed this show, so much.",Positive
The pilot was great I wish Amazon would hurry up and release more in this series.,Positive
excellent. What is not to like about our Navy SEALs.  Well done by all the actors and the writers. WOW,Positive
"Isn't incrediably stupid that I can't just give my stars and leave it at that?? What can of moron makes one have to write about something? Is this lower intelligence that had taken control of the machine? Oris simply a really, really group of people that sat in a board room trying to come with ways to justified their highly inflated saleries? Living in this new world of the Internet and reviews, what good are they, really, someone dribbles on and on about how this show or that song has changed their life?? I don't think so. . . . Think of it this way, the punks have taken control and we suffer! If anyone feels the same start written stumped and insane reviews like I have -- rebell against the machine!! That some like a good name for a band. . . BTW, I really like the show, which should have clear by my 5 stars!!",Positive
I was hesitant to watch the series at first but gave the pilot a try and am i glad i did the story is well thought out and interesting. The actors mesh well together and provide Solid entertainment a mix of humor / humanity which is rare,Positive
... But you have be able to get over the fact that this kid is not an attorney and everyone is okay with breaking the law. Its a stretch and pretty much a needless one. They could have just made the story around him being an attorney but from a B-rate university since the firm only hires Harvard grads (which you never want to do unless you want a handful of overinflated egos and not that much personality or talent in your entire office) and hidden that fact from the group. There are interesting enough story lines to keep you watching.,Positive
I love this show. Like most Elmore Leanord stories the dialogue is brilliant and has a cadence all it's own. The acting in this is top notch. I've watched this show from the first episode and so far have loved every single one.,Positive
"Great series, great writing, casting and acting.  Great fun for murder mystery.",Positive
No subtitles in spanish and english. Because of that i only give one star. But the video are in HD.,Negative
"Great reality show!  Recommended by an English friend and I knew it wud b realist ic.  Great storyline, characters, etc.",Positive
"i will write what i write,and i did realy enjoy what AMERICA at one time was,meaning families working towards a common goal,Survival...",Positive
"What a great show. This show allows you to ask your kids questions the whole way through. "" what do you think is wrong?"" And ""what would you do?"" Were questions I asked the whole way through. I also loved that it threw in ""ones trash is another's treasure"". I love explaining expressions like this to my children and asking them to apply it. This has everything I want it a show. Thank you amazon for all of these truly amazing pilots. I am impressed that they get what I want. I do not want my six year of three year old'm or one year old watching half dead monsters, bratty kids or pointless mind numbing media. Thank you!",Positive
it been a long time coming and what a shocker in the end. I like the story about hank miss a lot while he was gone but again it good to see them back!,Positive
"I have just finished watching the first season and am looking forward to watching the second. Very good acting, like the story line and I care about the characters...especially the staff.",Positive
Good thing I have a DVR b/c a lot of time was spent rewinding to rewatch the parts I didn't get the first time around.,Positive
kind of stays the seem plots are not imaginative. I think the first sixepisodes were pretty good then it kind of got stagnant and neverwent back to where it was.,Negative
"Dark. Almost too dark. Yet, I keep watching. So, does anyone else suspect Agent Debra Parker is a ""follower""? I am not sure that the ""second youngest agent"" on the team isn't one too. Perhaps the reason it is such a compelling show is that it is unpredictable.",Positive
"I loved Season 1 and the concept of the series, Season 2 just continued with more surprises and interesting twists.  Characters are interesting and the episodes are frequently packed with dynamic performances.",Positive
"The acting is excellent.  The camera work is also excellent.  The story just comes off as another police procedural, and there doesn't seem to have anything that would pull it away from a crowded space on both the internet, cable or broadcast television.",Positive
"So I rented this movie based on the fact that guy I met while on a business trip played the lead character.  I mean, how many times do you run into that???  So, based on those credentials alone, I rented the movie.  I've got to say, not half bad.  I've developed a taste for B-movies over the years and this has got to be one of the better ones.  Certainlly low budget, and some scenes are bad enough to make your cringe but I must say I was overall pleased.  I would actually rent this one again.  I knew I was in for a treat when the prologue crossed the 5 minute mark. With a &#34;setup&#34; that long, you know your movie is going to be full of HUGE plot holes.  Well...at least they recognized that fact and tried to fill them in for you!  Overall, great low budget flick.  Hats off to you Jay Laisne!",Positive
White Collar is one of the best shows I have watched in a while. I actually just started watching it but I bought all of the previous 3 seasons and am now caught up. Can't wait for season 5.,Positive
"Like all other SOA seasons there are some really cool car and motorcycle scenes along with some cool shoot outs, but this is the first season I'm not giving a 5 rating to. It's basically just wraps up the old theme that once you get into the life you can't get out but I guess I'm just getting tired of the SOA and watching them walk face first into the meat grinder for yet another season. In the end they leave it open, as TV shows always do, but I feel like the series is effectively over as of this season.",Negative
This romantic chick flick comedy was very well put together.  I would have been better without the bedroom scene between Kevin and Mindy but still nothing happened and it turned out a halfway decent and funny show.  I would recommend this to only adults but not children and teenagers.  Although it was decent and no nudity it still is the role model of a show I would allow a teenager or child to watch.,Positive
"This was bundled in (at no charge) with the newest season premiere of Burn Notice so I watched about 20 minutes of it before throwing in the towel.Bored out of my mind; acting is from hunger (if one can even call it acting); story is totally unbelievable and flat, and the writing is about the same: dreadful.With so much quality programming available, there is no way I would spend time finishing the pilot or watching any episodes in the future.Saddest thing is the creator, Jeff Eastin, is right on with White Collar (which I love).  Graceland just doesn't do a thing for me (except for the cute guys), but even an old lonely gay man like me needs more than young cute guys to be a loyal fan of a program!",Negative
"I am a true Doctor Who fan and a true science fiction fan, so I am used to a lot of fantasy.  But there is a point where it is too much.  I only watched the first two episodes.  I got tired of watching wildly unbelievable events that occur for no apparent reason.  I really miss the thoughtful plots of the older Doctor Who's.  Amy Pond is great but she is the only part of Season 7 that I like.",Negative
"A trio of strong performances highlights this three-character thriller from England.  The film wastes no time in establishing its familiar kidnapping scenario.It's what happens once Alice is taken that elevates it beyond the routine crime caper.  There are some unexpected plot twists and an unexpected climax.  Gemma Arterton's Alice is a complex victim, and she does extremely good job in a difficult role.  Martin Compston is Danny, the ""gentler"" kidnapper dominated by his older partner.  He uses his boyish charm to belie his darker nature.  But it is Eddie Marsan as the mastermind who dominates the film.  Marsan's inspired performance gives us both the hardened pro and the softer, almost pathetic side.  A performance of depth and complexity.ALICE CREED is not always easy to watch but it is good movie-making.",Positive
"Educational, cute and the kids enjoy it. Also like the multi language approach to get my kids learning! Very cute show!",Positive
Really awesome series.  Very realistic.  They seem to pay attention to staying true to historical detail.  Great storyline too.  Would highly recommend this series to everyone.  At least give it a try.,Positive
Sons of Anarchy is a very good show. However season 2 & 3 had too much small talk. They would have a good action scene and then cut it short to go to a scene where Tara and Gemma would be talking about crap or to other people talking. They did that wayyyyy too much.But season 5 was written very well. Best ever!,Positive
"I wasn't enthralled by the first episode but decided to watch the second anyways.  Wow, I was quickly roped in by the difficult life that this family has.  I've watched every episode and can't wait for more.  The episode where they take the barge up the river is just too much to comprehend.  This family accomplishes more in one summer than most do in a decade.",Positive
I found the show to be intriguing with a group of charters to follow the story line . I think there is just too much violence for my taste .,Negative
"Very enjoyable.  Marathon watched the whole season 1. I intended to watch it when it aired, but I work early in the AM and never had the opportunity to watch it.  Next season I will watch online on the original channel it is aired on.",Positive
How do the non-marvels handle the Marvel Universe? Question answered! Just enough connection to the mainstream motion pictures while staying true to Kirby's and Lee's vision of human heroes and villains.,Positive
Very entertaining and fun.,Positive
"Did women really wear their hair this way in 1966. That sight alone on two of the lead females was worth the price of admission. The guys, too, while not quite matching the girls in quaintness to 2010 eyes, came in a close second with those shrunken fedoras they sport throughout.Starting with these laughs which were unplanned when the film was made, there are many more in this Bob Hope vehicle, which relies more on old-fashioned slapstick than on the typical Hope gags. While having little more to do than show her body, deliver a few accented lines, and be somewhat manhandled in closeups unsuitable to a stunt double, Elke Sommer still more than earned her pay by just being second banana to Hope. Phyllis Diller, a frequent support player to Hope in his various comedy venues in those years, does her particular thing well. True she was an acquired taste, as they say, but in this film, she does provide some fun. The remainder of the supporting cast do what is required of them to give the star his laughs. Hope, himself, nearing the end of his film career, has better material and, therefore, more laughs than some of the other films he made as it became only a marginal activity to being America's favorite comic here and abroad. At this time, he had something like one-third of the twenty all time hit shows on TV with his specials devoted to his entertainment of the troops, most recently in Viet Nam, where a bitter struggle was rapidly escalating.So for many good laughs, no irony or wit, no character development, no symbolic meanings, a story line just strong enough to carry the sight and sound gags, I can, still laughing, recommend this as feather-light, totally escape, viewing.",Positive
"it was not what i expected.while it got predictable in portions, the initial twist made it a touching movie. i would recommend it for others to see.",Positive
"Great fun. Always entertaining and I like to try figuring out the solution before Poirot does...hasn't happened yet but I'll keep trying.  David Suchet as Poirot is wonderful. Clean, satisfying entertainment at it best.",Positive
as good or better than the movie,Positive
I hate that this show was cancelled. It is very smart and sassy. Tim Roth is a great actor. I loved the premise for the show..,Positive
"this is definitenley not a show for anyone sensitive,this seasons storyline has been a bit more dark and intense a very edge of your seat type of season.It didnt dissapoint in any way which was s somthing i was afraid of after how good season one turned out to be,but this picked right up with that level of intensity,and a storyline leaving you not just wanting,but needing to know what happend next. A must reccomend for AHS fans. Id also reccomend this to anyone who enjoyed the Kingdom Hospital series",Positive
I am a tech nerd and its good to see a series getting in on start-ups. This turned out to be funny and a good view of what start-ups sometimes have to go through with friendships and to acquire funding. Can't wait to see the next one.,Positive
"I love noir books, TV, and movies.  This is excellent noir.  Set in Seattle for incessant rain bringing a grey mood, the cops bring their troubled background to the story.  This was so well done, I wasn't surprised to see it was originally Danish, like the Bridge excellent in both cases.",Positive
"With the current popularity of shows like ""Veep"" and ""House of Cards,"" I suppose it was inevitable that amazon.com would start out their original content pilots with something similar. I was not expecting much, but the cast and crew is absolutely superlative. The presence of Stephen Colbert at the end made me think that they were going for a ""Strangers with Candy"" vibe. That is not a bad thing. Not sure what the problem people are having with profanity. That is hardly a flaw, esp. when discussing politicians I would definitely watch this as a series. Hope they vote on this one.",Positive
"This is a kind of amateurish film, with very poor character development. In fact, we only really get to know the female lead. In contrast, portrayals of the mother, father, boyfriend and sister are empty and shallow. While there is some hint of incestuous abuse early on, this thread is cut off with no follow-up. As for the pornography, it consists primarily of some topless shots and what might be called "" dirty talk."" A number attractive women are also shown kissing each other. Some males also do the same. The only bright spot in this production is the physical beauty of the female lead. The ending is kind of amorphous and the acting is sometimes hysterical--as marked by over-the-top emotional outbursts. Watching this film probably won't hurt you, but I don't believe that you'll get much it of it either. For those viewers that do happen to enjoy it, consideration might be given to the very similar movie,""Starlet"".",Negative
"This was a good popcorn thriller. Nothing more.The acting was good, story line had some holes but what film that we love doesn't?I can confidently recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good adventure film but isn't looking too closely at the cosmetics.Should give it 4 stars but, meh, it will find its viewership.Worth it if you can find it under $10.",Negative
"After watching the pilot episode, I immediately liked the premise for the show despite the fact there were several scenes that more than likely would OR, could not EVER have possibly been allowed to take place had this been a real life event. However, I was easily able to overlook that fact & enjoy the show simply because....this is NOT a real life event. It IS, however, just a fictitional story meant to be played out on your tv screens in approximately 42 minute increments per week. It'll be interesting to see just how the writers for Hostages plan to continue this storyline, keep up with the current level of suspense, keep as many of the same main actors/actresses involved and, do all of this without bogging down or dragging out any of the original story,Being a writer myself, I can't even begin to imagine how it could be done without the show falling apart so, I'm definitely going to keep watching this one! Although the first two episodes were a bit on the slow side in the suspense department; starting with episode 3, that begins to change. And with Episode 4, titled: ""2:45PM"" , I literally was biting my bottom lip as I sat on the edge of my seat! So, if you watched the first episode or two and felt it too boring, give it another chance. I recommend watching at least 4 episodes before giving up on the show. It really does get much better.",Positive
This show was fun at first but now the violence has just gotten to be to much for me. It has become senseless and disgusting and plain boring.  No wonder our young people are getting more violent and having less and less care for human life. These types of show desensitizes our young minds. Started watching from the first episode so will finish it but after will try for less violent and more intellectual.,Negative
"The cast is very believable; no forcing themselves to be something they aren't, which viewers could easily detect.  The plot twists and often has surprises most viewers could not predict.  Few flaws surface.",Positive
"I was living overseas for a few years where there was no Survivor television show, so I'm catching up on past seasons via Amazon. To me, every Survivor is fantastic. Jeff Probst is a great host. The challenges for reward and immunity are always engaging. I find all the talk among the tribes intriguing. And let me say that I can't tell the difference watching the HD quality from Amazon and the original HD airing of the show. Very happy with Amazon and this season is free for Prime customers.",Positive
"Simon Baker really gets into Patrick Jane's being. He's perfectly suited for this character and Robin, Tim, Amanda and Owain, complement Jane so well, it's symbiotic. Great actors, ALL OF THEM!",Positive
"I wasn't expecting the solid greatness this fantastically written, directed and acted TV series gave me. Most TV westerns of recent years have been a mixed bag. Mostly short series, not ongoing like this one.AMC has really got a winner on their hands here. And thus far season 2 is just as great. If you like your characters deep, and your western action exciting, then Hell on Wheels will fill your bill.",Positive
"This is a very in depth look at what really goes into your milk, and the effects it can have on people.",Positive
"Each episode has a different writer so some episodes are not as well paced as others and some episodes have better actors playing minor parts than others.  Having said this, this is an excellent detective series.  The characters of Inspector Lewis played by Kevin Whately, and Inspector Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox, are nicely balanced and play off each other well.  Inspector Lewis is a 50 something widower, brash, outspoken and someone who wears his emotions on his sleeve.  He always gets off a great line.  Inspector Hathaway is his 20 something junior partner, a former Cambridge seminarian who plays jazz guitar.  And, then there's Oxford, a historic institution, a place of high academic status, where the ego joustings are always on display.  Altho I don't always catch what is being said, it is still fun and interesting to watch!",Positive
"The plot for this movie is not a trite as some of the Hallmark movies for Christmas.  I like the storyline and, of course, Kevin Sorbo is great in anything (JMO).",Positive
Still fascinated at the notion of reading expressions of the minutest display.  The stories are engaging and touching when people are really faced for what they are doing.,Positive
I have been in awe of the writers and actors of 30 Rock since the beginning.  They never take the easy way out.  Another great show.,Positive
"Grey's anatomy is certainly a big hitter in the world of medical dramas, arriving at its 10th season here.  That said, little has been updated about this series since day 1.  In season 10 we get the same impassioned speeches, the same character drama, etc.The one thing that has seems to have changed is that Grey's has moved further and further away from the actual medicine.  These days almost every episode is about the drama of the main characters themselves and their personal lives.  While that has always been a theme, it always took place within the greater backdrop of the hospital.  By the time we hit Season 10, the setting of the show almost doesn't matter.  These could be workers at a Starbucks and the basics of the show would be the same.The problem here is that so much drama has happened to these characters at this point that it is hard to feel any connection to them anymore.  There's hardly a doctor among them who hasn't been stabbed, shot, died, brought back to life, married, divorced, remarried, re-divorced, sued, pregnant, leaving, returning, etc.  There's only so much that can happen to one character before you just become disconnected from the whole thing.If you're a fan of the series, season 10 is probably worth watching.  If you're iffy on the whole theme to begin with, it might be time to just say enough is enough and find something fresh.",Negative
Suits is a great show. Just enough drama. Each week keeps you watching up till the end sneaks up and you have to wait till next week. One of the best features I find in Suits is that -- it's funny! The humor keeps it from getting too heavy. It's just a clever and fun show to watch.,Positive
"This show is so good it could easily have come from HBO or Showtime. Gritty, smart, suspenseful, and very well-acted, it is a wonderful example of its genre. But even if Bosch is excellent, do we really need another cop show?",Positive
MY FAVORITE SHOW ON TV. THIS WAS INSTANT STREAMING FOR MY KINDLE.,Positive
"This movie asks the question what happened to the ninth legion?  It's a matter debated by scholars which is ongoing and recent opinions of the legion's demise has resettled in Briton.  That said, this movie isn't big on historical treatise and instead focuses on beautiful landscapes (filmed in Scotland) and bloody, brutal battles.  The 9th gets mostly wiped out and then it's a mad escape for a few men from the vengeful pursuit of the Picts.  Fairly good use of a spear by the silent female tracker contrary to what people are saying on here and yes the women did fight with their men.  There are some logical issues in the tale but they aren't serious by the standards of most.  Very impressive that this entire film was made on only ten million dollars.  STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B minus; ACTION SCENES: B to B plus; MY GRADE: B minus to B (B to B plus if you enjoy the genre); WHEN WATCHED: 02/07/2011.",Positive
Didn't care for it - just too stupid for me. Maybe if I watched more of it but so far it wasn't worth my time.,Negative
You can really see by now that Booth and Brennan are made for each other. They can't help but get together real soon. The episodes are so good you get addicted!,Positive
"Is always good to know what is out there and realize what we have and improve the value of  your house. As you can see in this kind the show , we get an idea about the the value of real state in on other states",Positive
"I watched this with a group of friends and was the odd man out in really enjoying this film.  It thought it well done and thought provoking, and though not perfect, it is well worth watching.  I'll definitely watch this again, and stand by recommending it.  After all, there really could be something out there.",Positive
"A  nice change from typical TV and its brought back the musical in a sense.  Glee touches on all types of discriminations without focusing too much on the high school model.  In fact, the teachers are some of the best supporting characters, especially Sue Sylvester (who sometimes steals the show) a la Jane Lynch who first stood out for me in ROLE MODELS.  The creators tapped into Broadway stars to pull this one off and it worked.  The nice thing about the songs is that they don't stick to one decade.  In fact, they cover songs that all generations can remember them even if they're all updated.  This is arguably one of the hottest TV shows in several years and the visiting A list actors and actresses supports my stance.  MY GRADE: A minus to A.",Positive
"I often like programs meant for kids, but this one didn't do much for me. I found it improbable, yet predictable. I'd rather see believable kids doing believable things.",Negative
"IF I WERE YOU is one of the most charming comedies that I have seen in some time, and unlike the trends today, the humor is not gross, but character driven.Marcia Gay Harden is a delight as a successful businesswoman who accidentally discovers that her husband (Joseph Kell) is having an affair with a young ""actress,"" played by Leonor Watling.  Almost immediately thereafter, fate puts Marcia and Leonor together, but the younger woman is unaware that her new friend is the wife of her lover.The ladies form a unorthodox pact whereby each will advise the other how they should handle their love lives.  Marcia, of course, has the advantage here, though she is not quite sure as to how she feels now about her husband, and her situation becomes even more complicated when she meets a handsome stranger (Aidan Quinn).The Harden/Watling ""friendship"" becomes even stranger when both ladies are cast in a stage production of King Lear, and Marcia gets the title role.Written and directed by Joan Carr-Wiggin, If I Were You is filled with witty dialogue and features a talented cast.  Ms. Harden, who usually plays more serious roles, proves herself to be quite adept at comedy.  Indeed, she is a joy to watch.The DVD from Kino Lorber includes cast interviews. Michael B.

I love a good documentary and this sure is one.  Great subject!  Well-done! I love hillbillies and stuff about hillbillies! This has inspired me to go on a hillbilly documentary buying spree.  Any suggestions? Please share! I love that the Whites are real and don't apologize! I just love this unusual and well-done subject matter.  The Whites are truly American rebels and Johnny Knoxville did a great job capturing it.,Positive
Pawn Stars is one of our favorite TV programs.  It is very educational especially when they bring in experts to verify items that have been brought in by customers.  We have learned a lot from watching this program.,Positive
"One of my daughter's has a huge crush on Benedict Cumberbatch and was all excited that Parade's End was on Amazon Prime.  So I watched it and got hooked on the story even though I was having a difficult time with some of the conversation (accents, I suppose).  The setting and costumes were very well done and as you don't see so many films set in WW I, I found it pretty interesting.  Now as to him looking good, this wasn't Benedict's finest number of hours.  But he did a good job at playing the uber-noble character, and the actress who played his wife is a lovely woman who plays her part so perfectly, you aren't really too sure about what her feelings actually are.  Put the captions on, and you will enjoy the series.",Positive
After five season this show still rocks. This show has a great cast of characters. I would call this show a comedy/drama.  I love the Crow family. Season after season they always come up with a great cast of bad guys. I still love this show.,Positive

"Caution: Spoilers ahead (although I personally believe that most of the people who read the reviews on this series are fans, not newcomers).The Shield: Season Fivewas a shocker...while Season One opened with the details of Vic Mackey killing Terry Crowley, there's an unspoken ethic in this realm of Terry being a ""rat""...yes, Vic killed a fellow cop, ""but""......the same can't be said of Shane's grenade toss and the death of Lem. It was a senseless death, uncalled for...Lem spent most of the fifth season coughing up blood and drinking Pepto Bismol over the stress caused by his decision to ""take one for the team.""But in the world of all great Shakespearean tragedies / Greek dramas, it was the necessary catalyst for Shane's ultimate fate in the final season.In Season Six, we also get Vic's Stike Team ""replacement,"" Kevin Hyatt. I think we pretty much know coming out of the gate that Hyatt is a weasel (as is more than abundantly evident from his post-one-night-strand behavior with Paula Garces' officer Tina Hanlon, but we also see it much earlier in the season). We also see the irony of Forest Whitaker's ""Kavanaugh"" meeting his final downfall for becoming Vic in order to take down Vic, and Wyms (CCH Pounder) fall to the same behavior as she lies to Vic upon Hyatt's entry in order to keep him on board in his final days, believing he has a chance at keeping his job (he doesn't). It's the same behavior, but Kavanaugh falls and Wyms rationalizes her actions. In the final season, Vic has the last laugh...sort of.In short, virtually every member of the cast makes an ill-conceived, fateful decision in this season, leading up to the Season Seven climax. A lesser show could be accused of manipulative scripting, but when it comes to The Shield...with the benefit of hindsight...these were all carefully considered, logical moves.A powerful season no matter how you look at it.",Positive
"""I respect consistency"". Author Monte Wildhorn (Morgan Freeman) says it best, if I were to refer it toward the apt direction of Rob Reiner, in this melodic and poetic spin on this movie.Rob Reiner weaves a story throughout a story, while Freeman and Virginia Madsen (Charlotte O'Neil) dance triumphantly within it's web.  The movie is candidly real, hopelessly romantic, and overwhelmingly personal.  I laughed out loud and was just as moved to tears all through.Just a simple plot, with a burnt-out, disgruntled author (alcohol swilling and unflinchingly sarcastic) and a struggling mother (positive and beautiful although lonely) next door. In this setting  there is nothing new.  There is, although, so much depth to the main characters, the people of the town riddled throughout and in Wildhorn's life.It is in this that makes this particular movie so worth your time; The ride from point A to point B.What first may appear to be predictable may not end in the way it will seem at the outset.  This is a movie of the heart; one that has the power to tug tightly on the emotions of those who are prone to love these types of films.Monte possesses the most foul attitude because of life's mis dealt cards that he's holding. As he moves into a new town for the summer, he begins to meet people (usually on his terms) and slowly begins to see people for how they really are.  He may be in a deep grip of emotional pain in the beginning of the movie, although so are so many others in their own lives.Charlotte, living next to Monte, begins a guarded then easy friendship with him.  Her three daughters are interacting, with a first uncomfortable Monte, soon after as the author side of him begins to appeal to all of them in different ways.The dialogue in this interactive movie is stellar, quick-witted and lovely.  Reiner uses visual stills that are able to pull as much emotion as any compelling conversation.  Of this, I so enjoyed the careful framing of faces and objects as basic as Monte's typewriter.I found also that the music in the movie is as inspiring as any of the delightful characters.  Of definite noting is the Soundtrack, with a featured solo piano by Marc Shaiman.  The high standard of the music is worth the while to listen to through the end credits.This is storytelling at it's pinnacle.  You will laugh, cry, ebb and flow through this piece of cinematic Magic.",Positive
"I have to admit: my expectations were fairly lofty for Bad Milo. Marino is a man-god and the brilliant Gillian Jacobs (Community) is in this too. It's also about a demon that climbs out of a dude's rectum to commit bloody murder. Those are some powerful ingredients.But would could have been a tasty souffl&eacute; of delight and coolness ends up merely as a serviceable B-movie. It's unique, for sure, and Marino carries himself with the expected verve, but in the end Bad Milo just missed cult immortality.Why? It's difficult to pinpoint. There aren't any screaming deficiencies. The story moves along swimmingly and the acting is solid&#8212;there just isn't that magic, that unquantifiable energy that these types of drive-in flicks require for greatness. In fact, as I sit here typing up this review having viewed the movie a scant few days ago, it's difficult to summon anything that stands out (aside from a particularly egregious murder/castration perpetrated by Milo).Granted, this sound negative; really, this is a fun little flick. But hopes are hopes and I was angling for some truly inspired lunacy. Bad Milo comes close, but falls short. However: I would be remiss to punch out of this review without some positivity. At least these guys tried and, in fact, succeeded in turning out something new and original and crazy, so let's honor them for what they did and not what they didn't do. Here then is my itemized list of Bad Milo Good Stuff.MiloPoints awarded&#8212;forever&#8212;when monster movies opt for practical execution of their beasties. So it is with Bad Milo and the nasty little construction that lends its name to the title. The puppeteers do a great job with the expressions and performance nuances and the creature design is imaginative. End result? A nifty entry into the low-buster monster paddock.MarinoI've suitably gushed about him enough, but Ken Marino deserves as much cred as I can cough up. For the man who introduced &#34;I want to dip my balls in it&#34; into the pop culture lexicon he's been long under-represented in the leading man business. But let's get to it: any man who willing assumes the position to let a gremlin crawl out of his bumhole deserves a nod.JacobsGillian Jacobs should be given much more work in prominent roles. That is all.The payoffThere's some obtuse metaphor work going on here (inner demons manifesting), but the draw is the monster running wild and the denouement features all manner of mayhem and a surprisingly sentimental finale. A fine capper to a fine little movie. Sadly, those are the highest levels it reaches.Bad Milo (Blu-ray) is a sleek 1.85:1/1080p (MPEG-4 AVC-encoded) transfer, joined by a DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio mix serving up an all-around solid technical presentation. Extras: director and cast commentary, outtakes, the extended dinner scene (which is very funny), a deleted scene, an interview with Ken Marino, a featurette on the puppetry, a behind-the-scenes look at the editing, an AXS TV promo, and the theatrical trailer.David Johnson, DVD VERDICTRad the full review at dvdverdict.com",Positive
"I was really into this show, and read it's last episode was scheduled for May 4th after EIGHT EPISODES. Not SIX! I want to know what the F is going on????>?",Positive
C.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation - The Complete Seventh Season DvdQuick Delivery! New Condition. Excellent series.HIghly recommend Amazon!!,Positive
this is one of my favortie shows so i had to buy all the seasons..im so glad that i own these seasons now.i recommend this to anybody,Positive
"I am giving it four stars for the first two seasons, but this one has got me completely lost just like the show. Her kid is gone she looks as if she don't want to do the show anymore, the story line has gone far above my head I have to watch each one over again to even get a hint of whats gonging on  number 7 I have watched three times because it said her killer would be reviled never happenI have paid for them all so I guess I'll finish S3 . After S1 of lost and the dead started coming back to life I didn't have to watch for ten more years to know the ending.",Positive
"Thrilling adaptation of the book.  If you've read it, you know where it's all leading to.  Still, it's a great speculation on what you'd find if you placed a typical small American community under the microscope.",Positive
"I admit that I found myself caught up in the TV whirlwind that is Bones.  But with good reason a show that focuses on solving crimes via skeletal remains mixed with humor, sorta romance and danger.  It all equals a wildly addictive TV show that has you coming back for more with each episode watched.It stars David Borenaz and Emily Deschanel as partners working together.  Along Dr. Brennan and her crew of coworkers who are just as important to the show as the two stars in it.  All kinds of things take place in the 2nd season with more storylines resolved and new ones opened up.  They are just as addictive and compelling as the first season and they even have an addition to the team as a whole in a new director (Tamara Taylor) for the Jeffersonian.I love the way the season progresses with the different members of the team reaching new personal goals and other things (marriage (sorta), promotion).  It's exciting to see a show this good actually stick around for more than a minute.  I can only hope that Season 3 picks up right where this season ended on a very high note and full of possibilities this time around.  That i'm sure will have even more people flocking to check out this all around well written, directed and acted show in Bones.",Positive
"i have contacted amazon at least three times now. the sound in this movie sucks. every fifteen seconds or so, there is a 'break' in the soundtrack, making it impossible to watch.",Negative
"Entertaining, fast-moving.  The first 5 seasons were attention grabbing and this season looks just as promising.  Tara's personality looks to be taking an interesting turn.",Positive
"Deception turned out to be one of my very favorite shows of the 2013 Season. I am so sorry that it was cancelled, because I was really looking forward to many more episodes. i bought the first few on Amazon to watch, after I had seen them once when they aired, and am now watching them again. I agree with what another reviewer said that Deception is nothing like Revenge, and I don't know why critics have even compared the two. I like Revenge, but not nearly as much as Deception. I especially love the chemistry between Joanna and julian. If you haven't seen this, buy the first 4 or 5 episodes on Amazon, and right now, you can watch te last five that are still on the NBC website. The only thing that will make you sorry is the fact that the show was cancelled after only one fabulous season.",Positive
"Overall the mini-series was well handled and held my interest right up to the end. The end, however, was more of a stopping point than a wrap-up as it left most of the important questions unanswered.This one may be good to-rent for those who are die-hard science fiction fans but will have a limited audience in others. I enjoyed watching it once but will probably not watch it again.",Positive
"Unfortunately, this show is losing some of its freshness and uniqueness.  They're even trying to promote it as &#34;The New Friends.&#34;  However, partially owing to reruns being driven into the ground by local stations, the episodes have become predictable, and Sheldon and Raj, in particular seem to be out of the writers' range anymore.  Amy and Bernadette have certainly added to the mix, but a lot of the endearing quirkiness seems to be fading.",Positive
"WONDERFULLY ACTED, WITTY COMEDY. NOT YOUR USUAL SITCOM. WE ALL ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. CHRISO'DOWD IS A VERY GIFTED ACTOR.",Positive
"very generic, poorly constructed stereotypes. Then and now, I'll bet mobsters didn't talk like that. The cop characters absorbed beatings that would put any citizen in the hospital for weeks. A very unbelievable cartoon of Mob-life .  On the plus side the scenic design and execution with the CGI was great; Very noirish.",Negative
"I started really liking this show in the beginning but it just seems to go no were now, getting bored.",Positive
"One well done and outstanding show.  But it was a victim of a writers strike action.  Shame.  Great acting and stories.  Too me, a must have DVD set.",Positive
Kind of funny in places. Love the main characters and but the story line is weak,Negative
interesting edgey entertainment from SYFY channel.......rough tough cowboy town of the future ....take a chance and watch on a rainy weekend,Positive
"The movie was ok with some intrigue but seemed to lose direction part way through.  Some of the secondary storylines could have been better developed.  Overall, it was evident why it was available to rent before it left the theaters.",Negative
".A vastly under-praised work of engrossing Story, Story, Story---and Revelation.This brilliant real-life documentary has a beginning, middle, and end---yet they are all one and the same, a passionate love story ranging from youth to the most silver senior years. It is a journey we all must make into whatever dreams may come, or not---yet a journey we can envy.Through a reserved yet non-stop roller-coaster romance in its twilight years, we witness the mature fruition of realistic love.  Flashback original footage of the ageless yet aging lovers flickers in and out like beautiful dreams of youth and quest and destination arrived at.Yet as the end surely approaches, love rolls steadily onward and reveals itself through a completed transformation of each lover. A sea-change; those are diamonds that were her eyes, and pearls his....I found tears in my eyes more than just once. This is a beautiful story that left me wanting more.Buy it.Watch it.It is wondrous..",Positive
"I never had the chance to watch this show while it was airing and now love it. To bad they cancelled it, it really has a great cast and story line. I will be lost to find another series as good when I finish watching season two.",Positive
not a fan. daughter didnt sit still long enought to really get a grib on what this is all about,Negative
"I've never been a huge fan of John Goodman.  I was afraid this would just be another feature for him, but the ensemble is terrific.  The show is smart and funny.",Positive
"I couldn't watch past 30 minutes....actually, on the 15th minute I went to make some tea which didn't help, by the way. The acting is just terrible, not believable....skip it, it's not worth it. I can't believe you had to pay 9.99 to watch it on demand when it came out originally.",Negative
"While I am still not sold on the casting choice for Dracula himself (too young), both the acting and the narrative twist on Dracula are quite good.Here we have Van Helsing and Dracula teaming up to take down a malicious, rapacious, and all-too-familiar cabal of wealthy egomaniacs who basically try to run the world through their control of oil.  Dracula is pushing forward with new technology that will change the world forever, for the better, for himself AND his species of prey.  Big business secret societies cannot have that now, can they?There is more to it than a polemic on big oil.  Dracula is a European vampire pretending to be an American, desperate to walk in the sun via scientific breakthrough, desperate to break the stranglehold of an evil society via energy research, and even more desperate to be with his reincarnated beauty.  Renfield is now a genius and a hulk of a man, not a maniac.  Harker is little more than a supporting thorn in . . . somebody's side.  And there are a host of interesting and unique characters besides.  A sexy huntress.  In the closet bad and good guys.  Vampires called to Dracula from afar.The settings/wardrobes are beautiful and accurate.  The music is as well.  The action is exciting and brief, could be better.  At least there is enough blood to respect this series as a vampire tale.Watch this series if you love vampires.  It's just a fresh take on Dracula worth seeing.  Even if Dracula's American accent is pretty bad.  :)",Positive
Whenever I need a good laugh all I need to do is watch this show. I can't think of any show funnier than Hot in Cleveland.,Positive
If you are a fan of HBO's Veep you will definitely enjoy this show.  John Goodman is very funny and I most enjoyed the show when they were concentrating on his character.  Bill Murrary was hilarious.  If he comes back I a definitely going to watch.,Negative
This is one of my favorite shows.  It is well written and all of the actors give an excellent performance.  Too bad it is over,Positive
"This was free on Amazon Prime. After watching for three and one half seasons, suddenly they want $2 plus meaning about $100. Feel like this is a bait and switch. Amazon Prime offered me $5 and told me to complain to the studio. Feels like reading half a book and losing it.",Positive
"This tutorial was a joy to watch.  I had seen the first two seasons already, so that certainly influenced my perceptions.  I love the series, too much.  There are a lot of relevant themes to our lives in Falling Skies.I think the tutorial was similar to professionally prepared tutorials on nonfiction subjects.  It may make others want to see the series by making the alien creatures feel real.",Positive
"...so now I can see it whenever I want.  I used to transcribe certain of Mary's musings...they were poignant or funny or just an astute commentary on human nature.  It was a shame it was taken off the air, but I will say, they did one of the better jobs of wrapping up the storylines in a way that made sense and showed us what the characters would be doing in the future.  So many shows are abruptly cut off or stopped in the middle of a storyline that was supposed to be a lead-in for the next season, or even had the main character killed off...The writers and producers of &#34;In Plain Sight &#34; did it very well.  Excellent series and I miss having new episodes, but I can now revisit whenever I want.",Positive
"I didn't know if this film would be awful or not.  Turns out it's in the horror-parody genre, most reminiscent of ""Return of the Living Dead"" (the first one, not #2 or #3) which was an amazingly enjoyable film to watch.  A couple decades later, this film has similarities in its tone and in the sheer fun it has with the zombie genre.  It definitely pays homage to scenes from a number of previous zombie films.  It has a linear plot: virus in a secret govt. research facility escapes, infecting strippers in an off-site illegal strip club, and things go from bad to worse.  However it has a decidedly comedic tone to the entire film.  It used as a source material a French play about ""The Rhinoceros"" (a gentleman's nightclub), hence all the references to French and European existentialist philosophers, writers etc.  In what other film would you get a stripper quoting Nietzche, or a spec ops guy named Camus?  It also pokes fun (repeatedly) at the George W. Bush administration-be forewarned- and it deliberately overplays stereotypes like the ""crack special forces"", the for-profit corporate contractors, the East European Madame, the greedy but inept nightclub owner,and so on.  It's not really very scary, but there's quite a bit of blood and special effects depicting violence at times.  And the ""stripper"" actresses are quite good.  They do make some beautiful stripper- dancers.  There is female nudity in the film.There are a few holes in the plot but it's all meant to be fun, so you can't take the plot all that seriously anyhow.Bonuses to the DVD include a whole bunch of trailers for other films, quite a few cut scenes (some pretty interesting), commentary filmtrack, and two fairly short clips on the making of the film.  I enjoyed the extras.  If you like zombie movies and parody, then you will like this film.",Negative
"What a bunch of crap this program is.  The best original programming Amazon has produced to date, and it isn't saying much, is the Bosch pilot.Could only watch 15 minutes of this 30-minute pilot and wanted to stop at 10 minutes, but thought I would go for another five, just in case things improved, but they did not.Everything about this TV show (compared to so much available content out there) reeks of mediocrity, including the writing and acting!",Negative
"This is something that should make all of us think. Is this or something like this possible? Small town setting makes you feel like you we're when you were a kid growing up. Suspense! Bringing different types of individuals together with different agendas. Shows unity, fear and a puzzle which may be solved with some different type of people who may never have come together if it wasn't for the most unusual of circumstances.",Positive
"Because it is a fun, thought provoking movie for little kids and adults. We enjoy it over and over. Hurrah!",Positive
"I was a fan of Lost and this series is similar to it. There are several characters and their different worlds to keep up with, but that's what makes it a good program. It's not always predictable and most of the time the show is over before I want it to be, and that's usually the sign of a good movie/series.",Positive
"I gave the first few episodes three stars because they were not my cup of tea but as the season's gone on, the shows have gotten better. My only complaint would be on a myth like the duct tape canton episode would be IF they took proper safety precautions than they must have really cut and edited these out OR they didn't take these precautions and are flat out nuts!!!! You don't go down a category 5 rapids with a boat you've never tried and without experience. I know these guys have done many stunts but I wonder if they are really trained for this. And were they wearing real life vests or bubble wrap vests? Still, even if somewhat staged it was a fun show to watch.",Positive
"Don't let the negative nancy reviews from this movie stop you from renting this movie, if you are looking for an amazing visual horror/thriller film with a very memorable soundtrack that ties the movie EXTREMELY well, then check out this movie! Also, if you saw Elijah Woods in ""Sin City"" and loved his character in that movie, then you can expect even more amazing performance by Woods in this Maniac movie as well.",Positive
"Story of a group of aspiring authors that get together to encourage one another and read each others work.  Then one gets an agent and a book deal while another goes the self publishing route.  Unfortunately, relationships suffer.

"Rome makes I, Claudius look like a walk in the park on a sunny afternoon.  Rome pulls out all the stops and show everything in full splendor and gore:  sex, violence, torture, slavery, execution, adultery, orgies--you name it.  This is not for the squeamish; this is full-on history in all of its gory glory.  Great performances abound from Polly Walker, Ray Stevenson and Ciaran Hinds in particular.",Positive
"For anyone that is interested in the history of the Formula 1 racing circuit this movie will definitely bring you up to speed. I am more of a novice at this type of racing, but I have to say that I have big admiration for anyone that can race these vehicles and this movie broadened this even more. The makers of this film did a masterful job at bringing together first hand information and race information for the true fan that will leave you compelled to learn more and on the edge of your seat as you watch the races themselves. The movie allows you to see the danger and the beauty of this sport and leaves you with a great respect for the sport and for the people who race in the sport!*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*",Positive
"The show started off great but kinda got lost after the tenth episode. Still fun, but you can tell the writers were looking for some filler to stretch out the season.",Positive
"I admit I've just started reading the series but so far Titus Welliver seems like a perfect fit.  If you look up his credits, he's been in almost everything.  Bit parts but always with an intensity. The episode was slow to start but, like a really good fire, it got hotter as it went along.  It's a slow burn.  By the end, I wanted the next episode right away.  Bosch has great potential.  I can't wait to see more!",Positive
"How do they continue having such warm and funny shows after all this time?  I don't know, but I love it!  To everyone responsible for BBT, the writers, actors, crew, director, etc...keep it coming! And thank you!",Positive
Think of the best combination of Law & Order and NYPD Blue and this is it.  We are cops/mystery fans and loved it.,Positive
"I enjoyed this show quite a bit. Sure it's a little rough around the edges, but it's a pilot with a lot of potential. Think 'It's always Sunny' in a highschool teacher's lounge. Please make more.",Positive
The whole series is great providing you ARE PREPARED TYO THINK CAREFULLY OTHERWISE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW ALL THE PLOT TWISTS,Positive
"I find myself cracking up even more than usual.  ""Dean Coontz"" is fantastic as the up-tight dean of the uni Hank is now working at (""Bueler.. Bueler.. anyone?  Bueler..), and with Hank's wife off in New York for a spell, the college setting provides a pretty good set-up.  Runkle's female agent boss is hilarious (""You say harassment, I say a couple of big juicy orgasms between friends""), as is the continuing saga of Runkle's marriage. Rick Springfield is one of his clients (turns out Runkle's girl may be better than Jessie's).The end of this season will be sure to leave you wanting more from the 'rocket man' and company.  This is an addictive show and Season 3 goes out with a bang.  Brilliantly filmed last scene.",Positive
"I am going to admit that this is the first time i watched Teen Wolf. So this is the review for people who are thinking about getting one DVD in a continuing series and catching up. I'm sure there are plenty of reviews for people who have been watching the show from the beginning and want to know if they can expect great things or disappointment.But as far as I can tell, this show is about a lot of pretty white twenty-somethings who are pretending to be high school students and keep turning into werewolves and killing each other. In one episode, they are on the school bus the whole time. In another episode there are references to red eyes and green eyes. Everyone is talking about alphas. The Greek letters are like the semi-finals on Glee - they sure make sense for people who care. Not much for casual viewers.There's also a lot of mood music being played. And the town has a lot of people dying. It's one of those fictional towns where the murder rate would be high in a major metropolitan area and yet no one moves away.There's also a flashback episode where both storytellers are outright lying. That one has some wit.Beyond that, the characters all look alike. Sure, there's the cop from The Wire playing a veterinarian. However, everyone else looks like an Ambercrombie & Fitch model and there's no way to tell them apart. I understand that this is MTV and its audience is more superficial than most, but does EVERY single character have to be blandly good looking without much variation? It would be much easier keeping the people straight if you they included an Asian character, a black &#34;teenager&#34; (everyone in the show looks like they have books about quarter life crisis tucked away) or even a character that is fat or &#34;Hollywood ugly&#34; (Rachel Leah Cook in glasses would be a variation as far as this show it concerned.)If you love this show, I'm sure you'll be fine with it. I don't know. If you are curious about this show, you would have a better time playing with Barbie and Ken dolls. At least Barbie and Ken dolls have personality.",Negative
We miss seeing Timothy Olyphant in DeadWood. So nice to have a show that is similar with a lot of actors for the HBO season Deadwood.,Positive
Who doesn't love this program?  Except maybe those Zombies out there.  You never know who is going to get eaten .............could Rick be next?,Positive
Constantly evolving plot.  Very interesting charactors. You really don't know how each person will change during the season. Can be watched each week with a different plot but the actors are changing over time.,Positive
"I loved season 1 & 2.  Rachel Nichols' character, Kiera Cameron, is great.  Her interplay and love/hate relationship with the Detective Fonegra character, played by Victor H. Webster, is wonderful.  Lexa Doig as Sonya Valentine is also very watchable.  I watched the first 5 episodes of season 3, and I love it.  The time travel theme is compelling.  The sexual tension between the various sets of characters sizzles, but is not overdone.  Not for the under-13 crowd, though.  The numerous fight sequences are well done, but I could do with a bit less overall of that.  Some of it seems gratuitous.  The portrayal of the dystopic future  in 2077 -- shades of Bladerunner and such -- is frightening, because it seems all too possible.  I keep waiting for the Kiera Cameron character to finally and fully recognize the injustices of the future, of which she has been a more or less willing participant,  and start sympathizing more with the group who is fighting the &#34;Big Brother&#34; of the future era.  Can this be where things are heading?  The writers seem to be foreshadowing this.  I guess I will have to keep watching.  Can't wait for the next episode.",Positive
"Duck Dynasty Rocks! and That's a fact, Jack!  Our family loves the Robertson's.  The show has fun, entertainment, and great family values.  Best show on TV (or Amazon Prime)!",Positive
"Just finished watching this immensely satisfying second series.  I love Timothy Olyphant,  I really do,  but he was almost overshadowed here by the excellent Walton Goggins at Boyd Crowder.  I do love Boyd with his terrific soft voice and frightening manner; he's so charismatic,  every time I see that Nazi tattoo I'm shocked,  it's too easy to forget...The Harlan county folk are causing all sorts of troubles for Givens this season,  and there are some shocking and sad outcomes, as well as some swift and satisfying ones.  I (and everyone else!) particularly liked the character of Mags Bennett, played by Margo Martindale who won a much deserved Emmy for that role.I did find Winona a bit annoying - does she even know why she loves Rayland?  She seems to want him to completely change in order to be with her,  but other than that it was a perfect season. Very much looking forward to watching Season 3...  And very happy with Amazon's unlimited streaming options. That is $70 so well spent!",Positive
My wife and I really enjoyed the main character and his unique way of doing things. The show was fresh and interesting. I was disappointed they only made two seasons.,Positive
"I have watched every show of Castle from the first one, and it has been interesting to see how it has evolved over time.  This season seems to have fewer surprises between the characters and more emphasis put on the mysteries.  They have gotten much more serious over time, and I like that.",Positive
"this show is good. the characters are pretty good and i like these end of the world type sci-fi shows. I hope it gets made, it looks fun.",Positive
"People alive in boxes whether buried or not have shown up in a few movies the past couple of years, e.g. ""Buried"". This one had more techy stuff (camera, phone, CB radio, annoying red LED clock) and had the more elaborate plot of trying to extort information from it's (How did I get here?) occupant. Just like a person in a box not knowing what's going on, this viewer felt like they were in a box in being mostly clueless and bored 90% of the time while watching just a person in a box with only increasingly predictable dialogue to keep from dozing off. To make it worse the writer & director tossed in two twists at the end that not only were stupid-unrealistic but made the preceding 91 of 92 minutes seem even stupider.",Negative
"That is what this series will do for you, except the servants try to apply modern rules. It is interesting hoe this real experiences effects the family. It just proves that associations do have an effect on people.",Positive
"If you enjoy a good deal of comedy with your SciFi you will probably enjoy Eureka. There certainly are plenty of serious events, but with a regular mix of comedy to keep things from getting to dark. Kind of like the X-Files which had plenty of serious episodes but then were visited by unusual people including ""The Lone Gunmen"" to keep things in perspective. The second season is a must have for anyone that bought the first. This season continues the investigation of the alien artifact along with the further emersion of Sheriff Jack Carter and Zoe into Eureka's community.Many of the budding relationships have now fizzled and new ones have began that may seem less odd or more depending on your perspective. This is not high brow SciFi for the most part although some of the ideas are based on conceivable research. Eureka is a town of Mensa types that have their own projects and inventions that they develop. It seems they aren't under the same rules as the rest the country so anything can happen when their experiaments go wrong. Good quality DVDs and excellent replayability, but I'm still not crazy about cardboard fold up cover.",Positive
I enjoyed this program very much. I hope there is more soon. I like si-fi and this show is very imaginative,Positive
It's really interesting to see homes in various cities.  It's also amazing how the color of the kitchen cabinets can be a deal breaker for a great house.,Positive
Blue's Clues is a wonderfully engaging show for pre-schoolers. There's an educational theme to each half hour show and the host involves the viewers in the fun and games.,Positive
Great season! Love the fact they are together and it hasn't taken away from the plots or working relationship between them.,Positive
This is a pretty good crime show.  Detective Kenda kind of reminds me of Horatio in CSI Miami with his &#34;cool&#34; one liners but overall its enjoyable and well done.,Negative
"This is one of the Best Alien Apocalyptic shows Ever. This season brings new story lines and creatures. I don't want to say to much and be a spoiler. Watch it, you'll like it!!!",Positive
"This is my favorite show! I live the story line, the characters etc... I didn't like Lenin very much much she's growing on me. Could not stand the characters Ruby and Lynly.  Glad they're gone. I want Zoe and Wade back together though. They're a better fit. Don't like Wade with her cousin.",Positive
"So far Matt Smith has been doing an excellent job as Doctor Who, I'm sad to see him go. The new companion has a very interesting story line and without spoiling anything a great origin story. One of the best episodes of Doctor Who is in this season, The Christmas episode was also interesting but now I have to go back and see what other episodes the great intelligence came out in.",Positive
"The exploration of just how far people are willing to go for the ideals they believe in is extremely well illustrated. Art has been defined as &#34;The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination producing works to be appreciated primarily for their emotional power.&#34; Never has there been a more quintessential example of one man's &#34;...selective re-creation of reality according to [his] metaphysical value-judgments.&#34; Sutter has created a complete worldview where the line is readily blurred between fiction and fact, and that is the power behind this show. Part psychological dissertation, part symphony, SOA will drive your mind and emotions to dark places that have you questioning &#34;the rule of law,&#34; anarchy, what family means, morality, and justice.I'll never get enough of this show. This is one of the few shows that just keep bringing it. It has aged like fine wine. There are continual developments, persistent twists, ever-evolving characters, and non-stop action (and not the violent, gratuitous kind - though there is a little of that too). SOA keeps you coming back for more. Kurt Sutter and the gang have really created a true artwork here.",Positive
Helen Mirren is absolutely the best actress. her character is thorough and  professional  the cast is as in real life-sometimes respectful of their bosses and oft times not.,Positive
"I think someone else also mentioned the similarities to The Incredibles, and I have to agree. Even the opening music was the same kind of music, as well as the whole opening title sequence...it was just too similar. You might want to rethink that if you don't want your audience to think ""Hey, is this The Incredibles II?"".Also, while the script is mostly good, you really need to ditch all the references to other movies. Do you want your audience to remember YOUR movie, or all the references to all those other movies? I mean, people quote movie lines because they were memorable and unique, so that's what YOUR script should be - UNIQUE. It should be able to stand on its own without having to steal from 50 other movies in order to get a few laughs. Speaking of laughs, I LOL'd when the brother called the sister shrew-zilla.I disliked the stereotypical self-centered daughter. I mean, I am SOOOO tired of all teenage girls being portrayed as whiny, selfish, superficial morons who only care about one thing - themselves. Whether real teenage girls are like that or not is beside the point. You need to show her as being a little deeper than she is otherwise her change at the end is too drastic. And why not show girls that they don't have to act that way?The evil dude, Flamingo or whatever his name is...his sole motivation is that he's pissed because the original Grim Avenger made him turn pink? Really?! Yeah, that just didn't work for me. I realize he's supposed to be a psychopath, but still...he needs more to drive him than that. Otherwise, he's just too one-dimensional and boring.At about an hour and fifteen minutes in, I actually got really bored. It needs to be tightened up around that point. The whole set-up is good, but it kinda slows down there, and then picks up again when the kids get taken and the dad realizes what it truly means to him to be a super hero. That part was good, if a tad overly sentimental. The whole ""family"" message is good and all, but maybe don't shove it down our throats so much that we gag on it.I hope my review doesn't sound like I absolutely hated this movie. I think it's a good premise, and the message of being a family and working as a team is a good take-away. I just think the writers used too many other sources to tell their story. If they can figure out a way to tell THIS story without taking so much from elsewhere, it'll be really good.",Negative
We really liked this one. We only recently learned about this series by this author and find it gritty and tense.  The characters were well cast and we were left wanting it to continue.  Hope they will make new episodes SOON.,Positive
"I enjoy new plots. I am a little tired of Darleks, Cyborgs, and Weeping Angels. Zero has escaped was good.",Positive
"This is an excellent &#34;Contemporary&#34; western series.  It has several underlining threads of story line so you are always kept interested. .  Examples,  dealing with current issues of the western states (interaction between Indian Tribes & Local governments), Men having to fend off cougars, relationships between parents & adult children, It has all the excitement of a good John Wayne movie, Heroes,  Villains, Bullies, Cowards, lots of action, lots of incredible photography of New Mexico and Wyoming. You see everyday people, not all glamorized, skinny, young fashion model types.  We love this show.  Only problem is there are too few episodes in a season!",Positive
"Horror comedy about a bunch of blasphemous exorcists who regularly engage in sin because that somehow makes them better at casting out demons.  The premise makes no sense whatsoever but that wouldn't be a big problem if there were laughs--but the only way this movie could actually be less funny would be if it gave you cancer, too.  Some movies just don't work--Hellbenders fails miserably as a comedy or horror film--it's genuinely painful to sit through.",Negative
Realistic situations - you start to &#34;love&#34; the quirks of each character.So happy to see a solid dramatic series on TV,Positive
"The characters, the set-up, the interactions, the dialogue, the pathos of highschool are all dead on.Don't do anything different. Just get this show in production immediately.The only character who is a little off in terms of vibe was the teacher in the lounge w/green sweater. He felt slightly amateur.",Positive
"I enjoy Guy Pearce in everything he's done so I gave this a gander. He's not afraid of diverse roles, to be sure, and while there's not that much for him to do here, he does it well. It's really Zhu Lin's film, and she is wonderful, making the various bits that might have been far more mawkish into some very nice and even touching moments.The script is a little bit all over the place, and the brief prison violence takes this out of the family entertainment realm, a mild misstep, as it's not the sort of film most action fans will gravitate to. But the basic message of redemption through caring for more than yourself works well, and the commitment from all the actors and filmmakers is very apparent.For all its flaws and occasional odd plot twists, 33 Postcards shines with good intentions and if you like to feel your heart open a little while watching films, you might like this one.",Positive
Little slow at first I can see I will be drawn into watching all the epic. l love these kind of horror show,Positive
"Talk about sibling rivalry to the max! This was a funny movie that lets you see that sibling rivalry does not always fade with time and age. Through a series of events, these two brothers battle it out to see who can win. While much of the movie is tongue-in-cheek, you can also see that the brothers do learn a few things along the way as well. While I did not know whether I would like this movie at first, I found the movie to be downright funny and the acting to be of high quality. If you are looking for a fun evening that you will not soon forget, this is definitely the movie for you!",Positive
"It seems the producers of this may be big fans of the Paranormal Activity series. It starts off slow, doesn't have the movie's title or any credits in the start (or anywhere except the end), and it feels rather standardized.You're immediately introduced to the trio of parapsychologists- a tech expert, the secretary (I'm sorry... ""gatekeeper""), and the head boss. And they're all in the age ranges and have the looks you would normally expect (with the exception of the tech expert having no glasses for someone who's good with computers).The place that's haunted also has some expected quirks, including the rather standard family- widowed father of a teen daughter and little son. And yes, the daughter hates her dad with a shocking passion while the little boy loves his dad with a passion.The strange happenings come upon rather slowly and, at first, mundanely. When they get revved up by a s&eacute;ance and a hippie-looking channeler, things really get crazy (at times, including a hurricane-force wind within a single room). But, frankly, though I hadn't seen this movie until last week, I do feel like it's too familiar. I feel like I've seen too many visual cousins of this film.There were a couple pretty good shock/jump moments that, though the slow timing/pacing hinted they were coming, still had a good jump factor in them.Then comes the story's twists. One dealing with the spirit of the mother (and why the father says a couple extremely crude things about her, even after his explanations, still leaves me blank in reasoning), and how the parapsychologists review the entire spectacle.Then the ending. After I listened to the whole opinion of the head parapsychologist, it took a bit of time for the last shot to have anything, so I knew there would be one last thing happening. Not only did it happen in a bizarre way, but, in relation to all the things discussed, it proved to be an ironic ending.All-in-all, I'm actually hoping they don't bother making a sequel.",Negative
"Am I one of the few who like Ironside? Yep. I like the aggressive way Underwood plays the title role. I like his apparent number two, Holly, and the two big young men who hang together and make up the rest of the team.The only thing I find a bit too much are the frequent flashbacks. I do know that there had to be some way to tell us what happened to put Ironside in the chair, but... Well I don't find it adds much.I like both cases I've seen so far. They were interesting enough to hold my attention. I plan on watching the rest. I so far haven't seen anything that justifies the negative reception I've read about on Wiki. This series, is my second favorite of the fall season so far. The other is Masters of Sex.My advice is to watch Ironside and not worry about the people who don't like it. Sure it would have been nice to have a disabled actor play the lead role. But as that didn't happen, I like the job Underwood is doing.",Positive
"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS SERIES ON AMAZON PRIME.. I WISH THEY HAD MORE EPISODES IN A SERIES, BUT I STILL LOVED IT.",Positive
"This is one of those shows that keeps me wanting more of it. I like the premise of it and how methodical they are in each week&#34;s episode to keep me on the edge of my seat.You get know the characters on this kind of show and I like that. This show is using a different way to end each episode by not revealing previews of next week&#34;s show.....WHOA! I LIKE THAT! They keep you wanting more....will the lady scientist FINALLY find that cure....now we&#34;ve seen how fragile the humans on board the LAST SHIP....what is in store for them, & the world, NEXT! I tell you this show is NOT BORING! TNT has brought us an excellent show here.....and I can&#34;t wait until next week!",Positive
"The story fell flat.  The concept behind the storyline was quite interesting and thought provoking, even fairly original.  The characters were unbelievable, therefore I was unable to be attached or interested in them, in any way.  I believe I even dozed off for a few minutes a little over halfway through the movie, and it was around the climax of people trying to steal the machine, but because I never invested myself into any of the characters, it could not keep my interest. The actors were so-so, at best.  Sorry, to any fans of theirs, but if they played their roles better, the characters might have been a bit more interesting and allowed this viewer to want to know what happens to them next.I truly wanted to rate this higher, just because the idea behind the story was so darn intriguing, but I can't.  The movie did not live up to the concept.",Negative
"I love James Purefoy. This movie was okay, it had good scenes, and the stroy line was okay. But not as good as so many other of his projects.",Negative
"The word SLOW, takes on a new meaning with this ...docu pretender video, it moves so slow it seems to be going backwards in time. Imagine an amateur with a video camera taping an amateur unsure of what she is going to say and saying it very slowly and seemingly considering every word for a very long time. Then the footage is not edited at all so when she stops and starts over you want to scream, &#34; just say something... anything ... stop licking your lips and rolling your eyes!!! I would tell you more but I decided to eat my TV at that point rather than watch another second of this really bad crap. Other than that I have no opinion.",Negative
"SUITS IS THE ONLY OTHER TV SHOW THATCOMES CLOSE TO THIS ONE.  YOU  FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PART OF THE GROUP.  THE STORY LINE IS ALWAYS SURPRISING AND THE ACTORS BAT HUNDRED FOR EVERY EPISODE.  SURE HOPE THIS GOES ON FOREVER.  I ALWAYS RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO MY FRIENDS.  IT JUST FLOWS LIKE A RIVER WITH CURVES AND ROUGH WATERS AND A LOT OF HUMOR.  I WILL BUY EVERY EPISODE THAT COMES OUT.  CONGRATULATIONS TO THE CREATERS, WRITERS AND THE SUPERB ACTORS.  THE STUNT PEOPLE SHOULD BE APPLAUDED ALSO.  THE ACTION IS TOTALLY UNENDING.",Positive
"I truly enjoy the fast paced adventures of Annie Walker.  I love her feisty character as well as the superb cast of characters (and their actors) who surround her.  Since I watch it through Prime, the show has completed it's season on USA, so when the arc with Sara Clarke came to its resolve it was so neat to go on to the next episode.  All of the regular cast and the guest actors are such wonderfully talented and delightfully entertaining performers, especially Piper Perabo and Matt Gorham.  Their relationship has been heating up, and the gap between now and the availability of Season Four on Prime will be a long and painful wait.  But it will be worth it.",Positive
"If you are a history buff or if you like reading about the Monarch's of England, whether it be a history book or Historical Fiction, this show is for you. It is narrated and has reenactments. The reenactments have a boring aspect to them but, you can learn a lot from it. So if you'd like to watch a show about a Monarch you find interesting before buying that Historical Fiction book, this show is for you. There were some Monarchs I knew nothing about or never heard of. You will definately learn some new material in each episode!!",Positive
"This entire series is part Grimes Fable, part Stephen King's horror books, part all that is British, and mostly fun.  How a group of morally suspect young adults could be so easy to identify with is amazing and an indication that the writing works. It is goofy and good.",Positive
"The main reason I didn't rate it higher is because this is the second series that I watched a few seasons of, got interested in and then found I'd have to pay for each episode the following seasons.I think this is a rather nasty tactic... get you interested and then start charging. In the case of this show I am pretty sure one of the seasons was free to Prime users at the time I started watching these, then it became a pay per show.It's made me wonder if Amazon Prime is worth the cost, and lowered my opinion of &#34;Prime&#34;.Also seems like there isn't so much of anything good (streaming video) available on it any more.",Negative
It is so convenient to be able to watch this on my phone. I love this show and am so glad that amazon offers it especially free with my prime membership.,Positive
The odd little Belgian sleuth continues his quirky ways as he solves the cases others fail. Fun to watch - not 5 star but entertaining and somewhat addictive.,Positive
"I love, love, love this show.  Great dialogue, character development and writing. The actors are sharp, the sense of place and ambiance is spot on (I grew up in rural GA), and I can't wait for the next episode.  Obsessed.",Positive
"Entertaining fantasy.  I grew up in a German American town and enjoy comparing some of the characters to some memories of my childhood.  Of course things were not nearly as exciting back then as the adventures in the story!  To some extent, to appreciate such fantasy one must be willing to engage a willing suspension of disbelief.  Being able to follow the story lines in sequence, without interruption, the way Prime streaming allows is wonderful.",Positive
"We all know the story so I can bypass that because the story seems pretty close to the history. Bravo for that. The actors? Kit Harington as the lead is very low key in his performance and I think that is what was called for as the free boy, turned slave, turned gladiator. Very good. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the man he meets at the arena and is destined to fight to the death but become buds, he is terrific, too. Outside of out gladiator friends...not much acting to talk about. Emily Browning always looks too doe-eyed and pouting and not buying her at all as the rich girl who loves the slave. Kiefer Sutherland trying some type of accent and strutting, not a good look. some of the rest of the supporting cast isn't too bad but overall I liked it for the spectacle and some of the story.",Positive
I liked Jeff Dunham on his TV appearances but was disappointed in this show.  I guess he thinks he has to have some crude content to be funny.,Negative
"What an amazing documentary!  I knew absolutely nothing about anything in the film except, of course, the great music that I'd been listening to throughout the decades. But none of the details featured here.  Fabulously entertaining and informative.  Loved it.",Positive
"It was an interesting movie.  Very off beat.  Make no mistake it is a horror movie and a little sick and twisted.  I had read the description and its not a film about paranoia or anything like that.  I don't want to ruin the movie for others so I won't give away the story. But, you'll need a strong stomach for this one and in the end you may still shake your head.  I gave it three stars because it is so unusual.  It was not my type of movie due to the nature of the film.  Family drama?  Really?",Negative
"I love Carrie and her abilities. I also love the way the show displays her ability, so the viewer can go back with her and see what she saw and watch her review it. She can't &#34;remember/see&#34; anything that was not in her field of vision at the time she saw the scene. And the show stays true to that. Very cool.",Positive
I really enjoyed this whole series.  I like series that have strong female leads and this one was great.  I am very sorry to see it end.,Positive
"Jeez, watch it. He's fantastic, and I love the series as much as I love Downton Abby. You must watch Luther.",Positive
"Behind all the refined and proper outward presentation of a symphony orchestra is a reality. Musicians are like the rest of us. Sometimes virtuous, sometimes sinful. Sometimes some drink too much, smoke weed, engage in illicit sexual adventures, demonstrate greed and selfishness, and rise to levels of pure goodness worthy of the most admirable among us. Thus we have Mozart in the Jungle. The pilot episode does not have me hooked to be a committed and faithful viewer, but it intrigues me to check out some more episodes, should they be forthcoming. And I hope they will.",Positive
"I did not watch this show while it was on till the very end. But once my doctor told me what it was really about, I started watching it from the beginning and played catch up over two weekends and finally saw the last couple of episodes on tv.  I will definitely watch the next season as I am now a believer. I have become invested in the characters. I have to admit is is a Great TV show!!!",Positive
"Basically Alton Brown does a weekly segment, each segment covers some foodie item (noodles, kimchi, meatloaf, broccoli).Food cookery, science and attempted humor (which admittedly sometimes fails)One of the few food network shows I still go out of my way to try and watch and decently rewatchable.Heard that he's decided to pull the plug on the series, so so so...Generally a good watch, entertaining and informational",Positive
"Grimm season 2 is just as good if not better than season 1.  The show picks right up were last season left off, and it is at a dead sprint.  Very good stories and acting.  A must watch.",Positive
Great cast. Great plot. You care about these people. I watched all thirteen episodes in two days. Just amazing. Thought provoking.,Positive
"I knew nothing about this series except that Betty White was in it (and who doesn't love Betty); I found that I could watch it free through my Kindle Fire so I went to town. This half-hour comedy is the funniest show I have seen in a long time; a laugh-out loud, pee in your pants type of laugh. You will recognize all the main characters beginning with Betty White, Wendi Mallic,  Jane Leeves (Frazier) Valerie  Berlinelli (One Day at a Time and many Lifetime and other shows).The show starts out where these three lovely ladies decide to go on  a vacation  to France. The plane unexpectedly  has to land in Cleveland (CLEVELAND????) - (THEIR THOUGHTS EXACTLY). In Cleveland compared to the other women (not true Clevelandites) these three look like movie stars and are given a great deal of attention by the attractive -he-men- of the first bar they hit. Long story short they decide to move to Cleveland where their egos are pumped up every day with every man they meet. They rent a house but Betty White-the housekeeper for fifty years can be fired or they can keep her---keep her they did and the show begins with their life in Cleveland with some mention of their life in LA  (so you learn what they did in LA) and how different Cleveland was but they loved it.There are many guest stars including Regis Philborn, David Spade, Tim Conway, and many many more very funnymen and women - Joan Rivers plays Betty's twin sister....ya' gotta' see that one!Betty is absolutely without a doubt the funniest lady we have ever had; she doesn't have to open her mouth for her body language and her facial expression(s) say it all.The story of these four begins and every single show is a gem unto itself. Do not miss this FAB  sitcom.I don't usually like l/2 hour shows but on my Kindle Fire (did I mention the first three seasons are free to Prime members) I could not put it down and, as they say, laughter is the best medicine, 'they' are so right.Don't miss this one-you'll laugh your ass off and wonder how in the hell  Betty can remember all her lines; do all that she does and still remain totally in control, funny as all get out (anybody say that anymore?) and worth the price of the dvds.I couldn't be happier that I saw this show and because the fourth season is $1.99 per show I'm going to get the DVD or wait until it comes out free on my Fire.  I plan to  watch the whole thing over and over --I'll bet you will too!!!! E N J O Y !!!!!",Positive
"""The Eclipse"" is one of those movies that sort of defies description when it comes to pegging its genre. It is not a supernatural movie in the strictest sense though there are supernatural elements throughout the movie. It also has elements of a psychological thriller. I think I'm most comfortable with viewing it as a psychological drama. The movie attracted my attention as I'm a fan of actor Ciaran Hinds who first impressed me inPersuasionas the lead character, and also in his portrayal inThe Mayor of Casterbridge. When I read that Hinds had won the Best Actor award at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival for his role in this movie, I decided to check it out.Hinds portrays a grieving widower Michael in this movie. Michael had lost his beloved wife to an illness about two years ago, and is now a single parent with two children, a girl aged 14 and a boy aged 11. Michael lives in a small coastal Irish town, working as a woodworking teacher, and generally leads a quiet and unassuming life. But recently, Michael finds himself being plagued by disturbing dreams and 'ghostly' visitations that trouble him deeply. Is he merely dreaming/hallucinating or is he really being plagued by otherworldly visitations? Things get a bit more complicated when he meets a London-based author Lena, whose supernatural-themed work titled ""The Eclipse"" captivates him and draws him to the author. Lena is one of the authors who has been invited to read at the local literary festival, and Michael is tasked with taking care of her transportation, etc.To add to all this drama, there's another author, an American, played by Aidan Quinn who is obsessed with Lena. Amidst this, Michael finds his supernatural encounters increasing with alarming frequency and tries desperately to figure out what is going on.The movie moves at a slow yet steady pace, so viewers looking for fast-paced thrills and scares will be sorely disappointed. Those who like atmospheric human dramas and psychological-themed dramas might appreciate this movie, as I did.Warning (Spoilers ahead)Upon reflection, this movie can be interpreted in different ways - a straightforward haunting of a grieving man; or of a man so lost in grief and unable to let go of his late wife and all the shared memories of their life together that he finds death 'clinging' on to him;finally, Michael is also portrayed as an aspiring writer in this movie and is frustrated by his attempts to flesh out a credible story that he feels will be up to par - I saw the supernatural aspects in this movie as Michael's subconscious trying to make sense of these stories that he is attempting to write.This is why the movie appealed to me - not only is it atmospheric with the gloomy yet breathtakingly beautiful Irish coastal landscape, the lead actor as portrayed by Ciaran Hinds embodies a complex character who draws viewers into the story and holds us captive as we try to puzzle out what exactly is going on. The soundtrack with the choir music is effectively haunting, though I must say the jarring crescendo at each 'scare' got a bit tiresome after a while. On the whole, I enjoyed this movie, and found it refreshing and unique in its approach.",Positive
"Great series.  I watched the first two seasons on Amazon, could hardly wait until the third began.  Maybe the wait from week to week for a new episode dampened my enthusiasm for this show?  Still a great show / characters.",Positive
It really feels like Moffat is squeezing everything and the kitchen sink into this part of the season. I'm interested in Clara but don't really care about the mystery surrounding her. It feels like the showrunner has lost his passion for the series and it makes me wonder if the 50th anniversary is going to be what long time fans hope. Classic Who needs more than a mention and a shove under the rug like it's getting on the show this year.,Negative
"Great show. I thought a show about lawyers would be boring but the writers have made it funny, exciting, sad, etc. worth watching.",Positive
Great acting and the characters do not get stale or boring. Very nice plots and something new around the corner.,Positive
"The above 4 names have been blowing me away for the last 8 or so weeks with their solid acting.  Each character has baggage and each time there is a revelation in their character's story it is always a surprise.  Diane Kruger is the breautiful blonde who came to notice as &#34;Helen of Troy&#34; in the Brad Pitt dud &#34;Troy&#34;, however, she has since proved not to be just a German born flash in the pan and has done marvelous work in such films as &#34;Inglorious Basterds&#34; performing a hilarious, yet fatally lethal, for her, knock down, drawn out battle of fisticuffs with Christoph Waltz, in which her beautiful pedicured toes were sticking out of a leg cast as her character had already been wounded during another hilarious knockdown victorious shootout with the gestapo in the Beerhaus down the street earlier in the film.  Then we have Damien Birchir who previously played Nancy's romantic,nefarious, Mexican lothario gangster husband in &#34;Weeds&#34; when his character was punked to death in a Mexican prison.  Of course we have Ted Levine who played &#34;Buffalo Bill&#34; the wannabe lady, lady killer in &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34;, and then went on to play &#34;Monk&#34;'s police chief boss for years after that.  And now we come to Annabeth Gish, &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34;'s late wife in the Costner failure, &#34;Wyatt Earp&#34;, the drug addicted/sex crazy wife of the politician to be in &#34;Brotherhood&#34; on Showtime and probably could play anything Susan Hayward ever played.  What we have here are people who are tried and true in their profession who can do anything you put before them be it comedy, high drama, suspence, satire, anything, which pretty much is called for in this fantastically written, produced, filmed, and plotted horror police procedural.  Don't miss a minute of it.  It all fits together.  There's even a little bit of that &#34;Big Love&#34; plot going on somewhere  in the background.",Positive
This show is entertaining. It's not too heavy to watch any time during the day. It's a good show to stream.,Negative
"This has a great cast. The look of good science fiction. However, the writing is flat. Too predictable. I watch a little at a time. Science fiction of any kind is few and far between. It is my favorite genre.",Positive
I loved this pilot it had the post apocalyptic theme which I have been watching for a while now. I liked how it kept your attention throughout the show and kept the momentum from beginning to end which in most shows they lose interest quickly. I am hoping this is a series that Amazon picks up because the ending alone makes you want to watch more of the series to figure out what happened and what is going on now.The show itself reminds me of The Walking Dead in its premise but almost takes on a biblical standpoint with the actors talking about the book of revelations without being super religious at all. It makes you wonder if they are going to be going towards following the book of Revelations or going more of the Walking Dead route as the series goes on. Either way I am hoping this becomes a series so that we can continue watching it because without it I am going to be forever wondering about the ending.,Positive

"I recently watched MTV's TEEN WOLF: SEASON 1 and TEEN WOLF: SEASON 2. You could say it was a lonnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggg Teen Wolf marathon. (lol) For a MTV show...it's not THAT bad. (lol) Apparently it's based on the Michael J. Fox movie, TEEN WOLF but instead of the high school `teen wolf' playing basketball in the movie...well...in the TV series he plays lacrosse. While watching it - I realized it's a teen, comedy, drama MTV show. (lol) Lets just say my wife's not a fan of this show...but it's ok because I ammmmmmmmm. (lol)In season 1 - you meet Scott and the crew. Everyone seems normal until Scott played by Tyler Posey gets bite by a wolf...soon he becomes...TEEN WOLF. So now he has to deal with THAT...high school...his lacrosse team...and his new high school crush on Allison Argent, who's played by the sexy and beautiful Crystal Reed. Stiles (from the movie) played by Dylan O'Brien is Scott's best friend and crazy sidekick. He's all in love with Lydia Martin who's played by the sexy red head Holland Roden. She's the popular `mean girl' of the school who happens to be dating the captain of the lacrosse team...douche bag Jackson played by Colton Haynes (Arrow). Then we meet lone wolf Derek Hale played by Tyler Hoechlin. He's searching for the one who killed his sister - - he's got his own wolf problems to deal but soon meets Scott and well...it gets a little crazy. (lol)In season 2 - all hell breaks loose. EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE has their problems. (lol) Scott's having to deal with high school drama, other werewolves, hunters...YES. Hunters who wanna kill werewolves, some lizard creature (which is kind of cool) - kind of reminded me of something you'd see in SPIDERMAN and there's a lot more. (lol)THERE SURE IS A LOT OF `SHIRTS OFF' IN THIS SERIES...so ladies. If you've never watched a TEEN WOLF episode...ya might wanna check it out. (lol) I think it's a fun and entertaining watch. Plus Crystal Reed's dimples and Holland Roden are good to the eyes. (lol) The Season 2 3-disc DVD has some cool features. On disc 1 - you can watch the TEEN WOLF Season 2 at Paleyfest 2012 event. It's a pretty cool Q&A; with the cast. On disc 2 - there's the CGI and fight reels...pretty cool stuff and on disc 3 you can watch the gag reel, ""Meet the new wolf pack battlefield"" and for the ladies...SHIRTLESS MONTAGE 2.0 (lol) There's other stuff on the discs...you just gotta pick what you like. Over all - the season 2 DVD is a tight little package.I give TEEN WOLF: SEASON 2... 3 out of 5 popcorns!",Positive

Keep in mind also I think that they are thinking more of the children point of view rather than  the adults but I have found the children of this generation is a whole lot smarter than we were and I think the story is not living up to the new generation attitudes and how much they understands,",Positive
"Indie Game: The Movie is a documentary that follows the independent developers of Braid, Super Meat Boy, and Fez. Although we do witness the developing process, we also delve into the minds of these developers and understand the struggles and sacrifices that occur to follow their dreams. Indie Game: The Movie is a deep and interesting look into the independent game industry.This documentary focuses on indie games, and the developing process. It is deep and detailed, as it shows the struggles and concerns these developers go through; if they aren't successful, however they measure it, was it worth it? The documentary stays focused throughout and balances the different developers screen time well enough (although I believe Jonathan Blow did receive the least.) Everything about this documentary is interesting; from Fez's appearance at PAX to Super Meat Boy's actual release. The music was also great throughout the documentary, it felt very enchanting.Overall, Indie Game: The Movie is an intriguing and motivational documentary; an interesting journey, whether you watch this because you like video games or not. As of 1/12/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, and a purchase/rental is highly recommended.",Positive
"I think this presentation of yet another conspiracy story is well written, exciting and easy to follow. Since the heroes are a group of teenagers this series might be of great interest to that age group, but I'm 67 and I loved it!",Positive
I will not buy this on amazon instant because they are charging too much. I mean I cant even download this unless I dishout more money for a freaking kindle fire! It is stupid to pay so much for a show I could lose if amazon goes under. Sorry but amazon you lost my purchase. I bought one episode and just couldnt bring myself to buy the rest of the season.,Positive
"We have enjoyed the Closer for all their seasons. So when Major Crimes came out, we watched it and loved it... So I Ordered this season so our daughters could follow also. Great Show!",Positive
I love the show but the music is too loud at times that the dialog is hard to hear. Looking forward to more.,Positive

"My wife and I love this show - it is funny, intelligent, great writing, great acting, great producing, and does not talk down to its viewers, the actors obviously love what they are doing and they work together so perfectly.",Positive
"I have not missed an episode since this first started ~ excellent show, excellent actors (young & older) ~ my only complaint is how fast it seems each episode goes ~ I would really love to see each episode last at least 1 1/2 hrs, maybe even two..",Positive
"entertaining and interesting tv series, too bad they are not more of them.this is good reality tv, try it.",Positive
"To start, I'd like to mention that this season is only 13 episodes, due to the writers' strike. That being said, I actually think it's still on par with the previous two seasons. Some say it seemed a little rushed but I actually think it may have been a bit too much to have an entire 22 or 23 episode season of breaking out of a prison in Panama that only has guards on the outside. They do a great job once again of keeping you on the edge of your seat with this one.A lot more is revealed about ""The Company"" and the massive conspiracy, and of course, Burrows and Scofield find themselves neck deep in it. Some old faces and new alike with Scofield continuing to outsmart pretty much everyone makes this another satisfying and addictive season of Prison Break.",Positive
What an incredible movie. I was pleased with the story line and the relationships he developed (even if he wanted or not) with the other characters.  Viewers will identify with any of the characters.  Sorry no spoilers here.  Highly recomended!,Positive
"Nice twists and turns. Sure some are predictable, but dang there you are caught up in it and waiting for what's next and hoping for this or that to happen. Good drama.",Positive
Each season gets better and better; the special effects are great!  Great show; like the actors and how the show keeps fresh!,Positive
"The idea of taking someone and hiding them away until the ransom is collected is not new, and that is the main story here.  What is new, though, is the fact that they are hidden underground in a remote area in the mountains and found by mountain climbers/hikers.It does get very gory at times but you have to expect that from the contract killers/goons who took the young girl to begin with.",Negative
"Watched this with a 2 and 5 year old. They did enjoy the show. I liked the parts with the elevator, the math, patterning, and review. Also like the arc of inclucing a mystery that Sara hasn't solved yet. Made me laugh. I though Sara was a little bratty in the beginning with always saying 'solved it' for minor solves. I would like to see that toned down if it makes it to production as it seemed forced with Sara saying 'solved it' too much and Sam trying to say he helped too. Overall a show I would like to see move into production.",Positive
"As we all know, the best Gordon Ramsay video is an uncensored video.  From what I'm seeing in these reviews, this DVD is censored!  No way!  I'm not buying it if it's censored.  Why would his first seven seasons be ""raw & uncensored"", and now season 8 is censored?  Nope!  I'm not buying this DVD.",Negative
My daughter is four and she ask to watch this show all the time. It's just a good clean show that I don't have to worry about the language or political messages being slipped in.,Positive
It was pretty good somewhat scary but still not one of the ones I would want to see again. Sorry,Negative
We don't really enjoy reality TV except for Swamp People.  These are really down to earth people who live off the land and respect what God has given them.  They will drop everything to help family and friends or even strangers.,Positive
I have just starting reading the Harry Bosch books.  From the 3+ books I have read so far this pilot seemed a perfect adaptive of the characters and feel of the books.  I think Titus Welliver is exactly how I invisioned Harry Bosch to look and act.I thought the pilot was great and made me want to see more.  I hope Amazon picks up the remaining season. This could be the series Amazon prime needs to get the positive recommendations like House of Cards on Netflix.,Positive
"Joe Bastianich needs to be fired from MasterChef. He's shown in so many episodes that he's a drag on the show. This episode is no different and we are treated to Joe yelling about a steak with no sauce, while spittle flies out of his mouth, spraying his saliva over the cooked and plated steaks ready to be served. I bet that firefighter didn't know he ate his steak with some special Joe-sauce!  In other episodes he routinely mispronounces words that have been supplied to him by the producers as part of his lines, but which he's not smart enough to know. His bad acting as he tries to play the ""heavy"" of the three judges.  This guy is just dumb as dirt. He's lucky he was born to a successful celebrity chef-Mother whose restaurants he could inherit. Otherwise the closest he'd be to the restaurant business is the inside of a drive-through window.",Negative
"Grabbers (Jon Wright, 2012)There are a couple of dozen ways to get me to watch a movie no matter what else anyone tells me about it. (Earlier tonight I posted on Facebook that the only way it would be possible to get me interested in a movie with the ridiculous title of Witching and Bitching would be to put &#8220;A Film by &Aacute;lex de la Iglesia&#8221; underneath the title. Unfortunately....) One of those is casting Richard Coyle as the male lead. I adore Coyle, both in his television work (Strange, Coupling) and his film work (A Good Year, What Rats Won't Do). But you stick Richard Coyle in a movie about invading aliens and rampaging drunkenness? I'm there with brass knobs on. And so I will not pretend for one second that I will be writing an unbiased review of Grabbers, a film I loved with all my stingy little heart, and I am going to rationalize away a lot of criticisms I have read about the movie that, I realize during rare lucid moments, are all quite valid (including those raised by my lovely colleague over at Nekoneko's Movie Litterbox, who coincidentally posted a review of the movie [[...]] two days after I watched it). But you know what? I don't care. I still loved it with all my stingy little heart.Wright (Tormented) and screenwriter Kevin Lehane (turning in his first feature) give us the tale of Ciar&aacute;n O'Shea (Coyle), a high-functioning (and I use that term loosely) alcoholic police officer on an island so quiet that most days of the year, he can stay behind his desk drinking. His boss, Sergeant Kenefick (Patriot Games' Jonathan Ryan), is going off to the mainland for some continuing education and, for obvious reasons, he doesn't feel quite confident leaving the island in O'Shea's less-than-capable hands. He requests a stand-in from the mainland, and gets it in the form of Lisa Nolan (Flyboys' Ruth Bradley). She's upbeat. Worse, she's a teetotaler. Still, O'Shea thinks he can get through the two weeks with minimal distraction...until the island is invaded by bloodsucking monsters from space. Eventually (normally I would call this a spoiler, but it happens to be the movie's tagline, so...) the two of them, along with the island's coroner, discover that the only thing that will keep the monsters away is alcohol. Backup is on the way, but the two of them have to keep the islanders alive until it comes...so what better way than to gather everyone in the local pub and have the biggest piss-up the place has ever seen?So, let's see. Slimy aliens, gallons of booze, and Richard Coyle. What's not to love? Coyle is a much-proven comic actor, and Bradley holds her own against him. There was one subplot that was kind of predictable (though I enjoyed it immensely), and some viewers might be put off by the over-the-top nature of the climactic sequence and a few of its build-up scenes. But then if Wright was going for a parody of every big-budget Hollywood monster movie since Independence Day, even in part, I thought he did a pretty darn good job of sending them up while still keeping his own movie relatively down-to-earth. It feels odd to describe a movie as affable, but when I put the two things up against one another, that's what comes to mind. Other than that, any possible criticisms of the movie that came to mind were minor at best; a few minor characters who could have been better-developed, mostly. In other words, what are you waiting for? If you're looking for a monster movie involving copious amounts of alcohol, you've found it. *** ",Positive

family friendly without being cheesy. I quite enjoyed this down to earth show. the characters are well developed and have their own code of conduct which they follow,Positive
I really like this show!  The characters are so funny!  This show is definitely worth watching if you are sick of crime shows.,Positive
I didn't know what to expect. But this is hard to stop watching. It's gripping. And they picked the right actor to play the psycho king. Worth watching.,Positive
My boys love Diego! They could watch this show all day long. Great for kids that love animals. Go Diego Go!,Positive
I don't know how the rest of the shows will play out but the pilot was excellent and intriguing.  The acting was excellent and it is the best pilot for any new TV show I have seen so far.  I will enjoy watching more but I will be willing to watch on Amazon to avoid the annoying and awful commercials of regular TV shows.,Positive
I'm not sure why this show got canceled. Ty Burrell is just as great as he is on Modern Family and the rest of the cast are just as spot on with their comedic delivery. If you like Modern Family I would definitely recommend this show.,Positive
"I really want to like this pilot more since I seem to get hooked on most apocalyptic dramas, but despite the end of the world setting I just didn't get sucked-in to the story introduced in the pilot.I would definitely like to see a couple more episodes just to see where the writer was going with the chaos in the pilot, but if the show doesn't make it to that point I will not be extremely surprised.  One thing that bothers me in particular is the choice to reveal all of the characters shared birthdays casually in the kitchen and then move on immediately.  The pacing in the pilot starts out well, but once they get out of the garage there is another episode or two of plot crammed in to the second half of the pilot.Also, the main character gets a huge steel gate dropped on her ankle and then gets trampled by a crowd but she seems to remain completely uninjured.  Why put her through trauma if she doesn't show any suffering?  I understand she is a strong female lead, and she is beautiful and French, but that wasn't enough for me to allow myself not to notice how she reacts to what she's supposed to be going through.Despite all of that I would still like to see a little bit more, because I get the feeling that the creators of the show have a sort of epic journey planned for future episodes.",Negative
"Have to say that during this season the starts of the shows with the intros to the site and witness interviews, things go a little off track at times. And guys it doesn't work, keep to what you do well - please!Good locations as usual and hard work, lots of effort continue to provide solid evidence.They do a great job and debunk and recheck what they find, which is commendable.Keep up the good work guys.",Positive

"You can tell by the way the show is no longer funny.  It's a shame, this was a great show.",Negative
Lot of what I like about this is show is not even about cars. Its about 3 guys having a good time and the cars are just the means to that good time. I don't mind them not spending a lot of time talking about cookie cutter cars. After a while they all seem just about the same. Its the unique cars that offer a better story and experience. Top Gear enjoys the experience a car can provide with a driver.Its good that there as still cars out there that can be a extension of the driver and not just another one of many cranked out on the assembly line.,Positive

"Samuel L. Jackson gets out of prison after 25 years. There is no one there to greet him. He attempts to locate people from his past, only to find out they are dead, moved on, or don't want anything to do with him...all except for one man, Ethan (Luke Kirby) the son of his former grifter partner, the man Jackson killed. Jackson attempts to avoid criminal activity and Ethan, but his past is there to haunt him. You know a con is going to happen, but who is going to con who?The movie limps along holding your interest, but like any grifter movie, the ending is what determines the genius and likability of the production...dropping clues and hints along the way about the sting and twist. This one really didn't do it very well, although it does have a wicked twist. Rental at best.F-bombs, sexual situations, nudity (Ruth Negga) 2 1/2 stars.",Negative
Nonstop action.  Fascinating PLOTS all interwoven during the course of a day.  Top notch ACTING of fully believable and  intriguing characters.,Positive
"If you like action this is a great movie for that. Awesome fight scenes and worth watching! Move over Jackie, Tony Jaa just took your place!",Positive
"This show is very interesting. The story line is pretty good, plot is a little predictable but still had attention keeping abilities. The couple sex seans were not nessesary but not very frequent.",Positive
"I've been an ardent fan of the show from the beginning, of the extraordinary cast in particular (they get 5 Stars!)- in seasons one and two I waited each week with baited breath for the next episode. But even though I want to see what happens next, and I'm watching season three, some things have troubled me about the show from the start. I've thought about it quite a bit, and though I'm not sure how well I can express it, I'll try. [NOTE: There's a new update at the end of my review.]I read recently that the director Sidney Lumet said ""In a well-written drama, the story comes out of the characters. The characters in a well-written melodrama come out of the story."" Though I'm still puzzling over what this means, exactly, by that definition I'd say Once Upon a Time is a melodrama, in that it is plot-driven, rather than character-driven. I think in the best works, in any genre, a great story zigzags back and forth between drama and melodrama, i.e., between plot and character development, each seamlessly informing and enriching the other. ONCE is woefully inadequate in the character development department. The characters are one-dimensional. These fantastic actors (and we fans) deserve so much more.Before you say ""They're fairy tale characters, for goodness sake, what do you expect?"" I expect good drama- character development to rival, complement mythic themes. In thinking about the show, it finally dawned on me that the character neglect reminds me of the cognitive deficits in certain syndromes. In autism, for example, especially Asperger's Syndrome, one thing that characterizes many patients is a preoccupation with the trees to the exclusion of the forest. Such patients focus for hours on separate parts, on the mechanics of things. An analogy might be someone intent on cataloging the stars in the sky, one after another, but being unable to appreciate the majesty of the cosmos, feel a sense of awe and wonder when appraising the night sky in its entirety.Similarly, in Oliver Sacks's wonderful bookThe Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat: And Other Clinical Tales, he describes the behavior and bizarre ""reality"" of patients who've suffered right-hemisphere brain damage. What remains is the left hemisphere, and the way it processes info is by parts and feature analysis. Lacking the right brain, which puts everything together, sees relations, wholes, and attaches feelings and significance to perceptions and events, the left brain focuses on sequential details, linear analysis, which results in a very odd and unsatisfying experience for those affected, sadly. Indeed, patients with Asperger's and RH damage tend to have great difficulties with personal relationships, their perceptual blinders rendering them unable to apprehend other people in all their complexity. People who love them often find interactions extremely frustrating.ONCE reminds me of that brand of reality, a focus on the machinations of the plot, with scant appreciation of the depth, profundity and emotional complexity of human beings, both individually and in concert with each other. The characters' major function is to drive the plot forward, it's the plot itself that take precedence, like a big math problem (albeit at times an intriguing one).The antithesis of this, for me, might be the pithy, splendid TV SeriesThe Crow: Stairway To Heaven - The Complete SeriesorFairytale: A True Story. They succeed as both superb melodrama and superb drama, emotionally affecting, weaving intricate plot lines and characters into tapestries that become far more than the sum of their parts.And another observation, at the risk of sounding sexist- I can't help but wonder if the fact that all the writers on the show are male doesn't contribute to this preoccupation with mechanics and linear details (research has shown that left brain processes tend to predominate in males, whereas females tend to use both hemispheres in tandem). Seriously, if I didn't know better I'd swear the show was written by a bunch of 14 year-old boys with high-level Asperger's Syndrome (some Asperger's folks have high IQs, see the world in simplistic, black and white terms, but construct super-elaborate scenarios around simplified themes from which they're loathe to deviate).[Update: I stand corrected- as others kindly pointed out, they've corrected that situation and have hired female writers, I'm happy to learn.] Fairy tales have traditionally been the province of girls, much more so than boys. Granted, most fairy tales were recorded &/or collected by men, but I've always pictured them being offered as gifts, infused with hopes and dreams, by mothers down through the ages, told as bedtime stories, a feminine oral tradition fueling their children's- especially their daughters'- imaginations. I DO applaud the writers for depicting strong, heroic women, kudos for that.  All I know is that what l most love about fairy tales...isn't here, it's missing.Were I the head writer on the show, I'd ensure that the writers focus less on the dizzying intricacies and pyrotechnics of the plot (could it BE more pointlessly complicated??), and slow down a bit, putting flesh on characters' bones and exploring relationships between them. Can you do that without sacrificing clever plot twists, and while still showing what's happening with multiple characters? Sure, ST. ELSEWHERE, for example, did it spectacularly well (the best TV show ever, I think, link below)- and the hit showBorgen - Season 1too, from Denmark. And actually, come to think of it, another offering starring Ginnifer Goodwin,He's Just Not That Into You, also succeeded in that respect (at least I think so, not everyone liked it as much as I). In a review of it it was noted that even a brief scene in which Bradley Cooper declined Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette bespoke volumes about the characters (while also advancing the plot), no wasted moments. Anyway, the marvelous actors on ONCE deserve such character development and subtlety, that's what I'm waiting for, yearning for, anyway...Then again, when I'm feeling a little less magnanimous, I wonder if maybe the writers and producers don't know EXACTLY what they're doing. Now and then there's this nagging feeling that somehow I'm being made a fool of, that maybe someone's having a good laugh at my expense.  Why would ANYONE stick around, year after year, given so few crumbs, on a mere promise of something that never seems to materialize? Where's the payoff for my attentiveness, my loyalty? Perhaps some suit said: ""Mix up the metaphors!  Throw in everything but the kitchen sink, THAT'LL keep 'em guessing.  Hell, we can even call it a new GENRE!"" Or: ""Just toss around a few buzzwords, you know, true love, true hearts, true WHATEVER...human imagination being what it is, they'll supply their OWN profundity.  HEY! How about  SAVIOR- it's LOADED with associations, throw THAT in!""  Could there be a standing bet as to how long the show can be drawn out, how much profit can be amassed, how much convoluted but simplistic drivel can be heaped on hapless fans before they begin to get wise? You know the old saying, you can fool some of the people... I haven't given up on ONCE yet, but I'm getting awfully close.UPDATE: The show continued in much the same vein, until Episode 4, Quite a Common Fairy- smashing, brilliant, exactly the kind of stories, with the interpersonal punch, I've longed for.  If the show continues with this kind of writing I'll be one happy fan.  WELL DONE!Sadly, it didn't.  Emma tells the love of her life that she'd hoped he was dead, for no other reason than to set up the continued relationship with Hook. They couldn't have come up with a better line than that?  Awful. In the latest episode, we learn of Peter Pan's origin- another dazzling twist, dazzle purely for dazzle's sake.  Pan's Scottish brogue morphs into an English accent when he becomes a boy, unbelievably.  I am so discouraged with the gaffes, the lack of care, substance and depth, so disappointed.",Negative
Characters that grate and dialogue that annoys rather than entertains. Is this a comedy because a man in a dress is supposed to be funny (it's not)? Let's hope this one doesn't make it past the pilot.,Negative
This pilot episode makes me oddly nostalgic for Freaks and Geeks. Maybe this is what the kids on that show would have grown into?,Positive
"As MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a  movie format, it is good to look at each part as one part can ruin an entire episode.The movie: Even though this movie is from the 90's, it basically ignores all movie advancements since the 50's (like character development, plot, camera angles, lighting, etc.).  Yes this is the man-turns-into-monster plot (or in this case about five men who turn into five different monsters) that was already over used by 1956.  I at first thought they colorized ""Mad Monster"" until I realized that the actors in ""Mad Monster"" didn't have such strange accents.  So yes the movie is bad although the accents and the nonsensical soundtrack are funny enough to make it slightly watchable.Segments: The last two with Mike and Crow were hilarious.  I did like the how Pearl presented the movie with a one word introduction - about the same effort that the producers used to make it.Riffs: No outstanding stingers but a good job by Mike and the bots from start to end.  They of course have fun pointing out that the monster and one of the character's hair are different in every scene.Overall:  Not a classic but a very good episode.",Positive
"Simply amazing. The action picked up quickly, once the first season left things set up and ready to explode. Packed with action and interesting twists, I can say I am efficiently hooked to this series.",Positive
"This is a wonderful children's show (2-7) with super cute characters, good writing, and concise story lines small children can follow.",Positive
"Season 1 did more for me than season 2.At its core, it's the same formulaic cop show that ever station on TV has 40 copies of, and has been showing nonstop since 1998.  However, it puts an X-Men-ish spin on the crimes themselves and the people solving them, and it makes the characters more dynamic, and the resulting cases a lot more fun.  The dialogue is perfectly servicable - no one's gonna think they're watching HBO, but it's equal or better to any of the swathe of Criminal Minds, Numbers, etc. shows that are on these days.Good (but not great) cast of characters.  The autistic kid who can see electromagnetic spectrums was by far the most fun character in the show, with the lead Doctor a close second.  As you can tell from my review, written 6 days after finishing the series, the names weren't exactly distinctive enough to make a memorable impression.Solid show - especially considering that it was a Syfy original!",Positive
"I was very disappointed in this production; I suppose there are only so many ways to bring to film the events and tragedies of the Kennedy family, before it becomes simply a rehashing of commonly known facts. This in no way compares to the 1983 NBC Miniseries ""The Kennedy's"", for one's money that is DVD to purchase.",Negative
"The opening to &#34;Adult World&#34; is enough to let you know what you're in for as you witness Amy attempt to commit suicide by sticking her head in the oven and putting a plastic bag over her head. After getting a job at Adult World, Amy's boss is a very down to earth guy named Alex (Evan Peters) who may work at an adult video store, but has no issue with that whatsoever and he doesn't let that affect his other interests. It's through Alex and Adult World that Amy meets a drag queen named Rubia (Armando Riesco) and even though they get off on the wrong foot they eventually become really good friends.Unfortunately Amy is blinded by selfishness and obsessed with a pessimistic hack. Amy makes a series of poor decisions to try and follow her dream of becoming a poet. She makes childish mistakes, but then becomes upset when someone calls her a child. She's irritating, has a nerve-grating voice, is naive, and extremely pompous as she seems to look down on everyone around her. Alex at least seems normal even though he works in what some would consider an uncomfortable environment, but the most interesting character is Rubia. The character really doesn't do much other than smoke pot, ride a stolen bicycle, and give other women makeovers, but Rubia never pretends to be anything that she isn't. Amy asks Rubia in one scene if she has ever felt invisible. Rubia's face distorts as she says, &#34;Not really.&#34; It's as if Rubia has all the attention she's ever wanted while Amy continues to search for the big break she's always craved.If you can persevere through Amy's temper tantrums and John Cusack acting like he has no interest in being in &#34;Adult World,&#34; then there actually is something really positive and inspirational lying under layers within the film. Like &#34;Inside Llewyn Davis,&#34; &#34;Adult World&#34; seems to speak to you if you've ever felt like a struggling artist. Along the way, Amy learns that it's not just about making a name for yourself, getting rich, or becoming famous. You can't make a carbon copy of the path your idol took or follow in anyone else's footsteps. Sometimes you have to take your own path and create your art just for you.&#34;Adult World&#34; has this really exceptional message wrapped up in this unbelievably obnoxious package that almost makes the entire experience unbearable. It's like a really disgusting bag of garbage filled with rotting produce and decomposing meats; the type of garbage that creates that dirty, brown trash juice you always find bleeding out of dumpsters. Yet in the middle of that bag is something worthwhile like a forgotten treasure map or one of your favorite comic books magically still in mint condition. &#34;Adult World&#34; may have meaning, but you have to trudge through waist deep piles of unfiltered, prepubescent, overdramatic whimpering just to get to it.",Negative

"Only insignificant spoilers aheadGreat, adult oriented, show. Compelling characters, good acting and great reconstruction of Viking culture. Less bloody than you might expect, though nobody will ever accuse this of being a family-oriented show. The show is based (loosely) on the ancient viking tales of Ragnar Lothbrok, a Viking who may or may not have done all of the things he is given credit for in the writings of the monks and scribes who penned the tales. I warn you to not read too deeply into those tales before you see the series, as it will give you some unwanted (in my case) insights into where major plot lines of the story will go, and the fates of some of the major characters.I was especially pleased with the way in which Ragnar's character is played. He's not a particularly nice fellow - he becomes famous for killing a lot of, often, defenseless people and stealing their stuff. On the other hand, his home-life is shown in a mostly favorable light - good father and provider and such stuff. How can you really be a hero to a modern audience when you slaughter entire monasteries and then get a captive monk drunk and develop a sense of trust with him so that he tells you the locations of other targets to hit? Fortunately the writers don't try to clean up his life-story, or life-style and shows Ragnar and his people as the savage killers they are. Killers with a, sometimes flexible, code of honor, but still killers.Interestingly enough I have figured that this version is a 'cleaned up' edit of what has been shown elsewhere. Having read about the series on some other websites before deciding to watch it, I saw screen shots that did not appear in this version. Evidently it is ok to show axes splitting skulls, but we have to protect little Timmy from any potentially offensive sexual content.In any event, the series was great and my wife and I binge watched through the first season in a weekend. We are very much looking forward to seeing the second season once it becomes available.",Positive
At first my son did not want to watch it but once it started playing and showing kids all the fun games they could do outside without toys he got into it. Now he wants to go outside and play here we go looped de loop. Also it does a very good job at showing kids about Africa's culture.,Positive

"This is the movie where I found out Johnny Cash was not the original man in black. It was Solomon Kane. And he's really black. Except where he's exceptionally pale, because, it's like medieval England and, well, we all know about the weather in England. It's never sunny. I never really ""got"" this movie. So, here's this guy who used to be bad, but turns good, but not because he wants to, but has to because of true love. He never really falls for the chick too hard, which is a surprise to me. I mean, if she's the reason he's keeping on, shouldn't he, like, show her? Instead, he is, THE MAN IN BLACK. And the fight scenes. If the movie were to showcase his badassery, I don't think they did a fantastic job. He, cuts, he slices, he dices, but he, to my my taste, didn't do so with panache, with infinite style, with a certain Bondian charm. People die, sure, but, The man in black works at it, so it's not really justice served with a side of immortal reason, it's more justice served with a bunch of grunting and farting, if you will. Samurai pictures show swordsmanship that is truly spectacular, ten people die with three strokes. That's amazing. I suppose the fighting in the man in black is more ""realistic,"" but, in a movie where all manner of flying beasts and demons appear, is ""reality"" really a major point?",Negative
Really funny show. Nick kroll never disappoints :) I don't follow sports but this show is still hilarious . I recommend it,Positive
"I always like Poirot, but it got more violent in the end.  The first few series were more mellow, but they were good,  I liked them more than the later ones.  I still liked this one, just not as much.",Positive
I enjoy this show so much.  It's a lot of fun and I'll continue to watch all the seasons that are available.,Positive
"Janet (Julianne Michelle) is moving out. She is happy to get away from her alcoholic controlling mother (Rebecca De Mornay). She is elated as she moves into her apartment. After 15 minutes she wants to leave. She discovers a woman killed herself there, the super is a pervert, the apartment is haunted, and it smells. Her boyfriend comes over (Corey Sevier) but that doesn't help.The film spends a lot of time building up character with stale dialouge. The creep factor never grabs you. The ghost make up wasn't that great and the spooky scenes were too well lit. It seems they missed the key elements to make a decent ghost story.Might work as a rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb, one sex scene. No nudity. Julianne Michelle bra/panties. $9.96 Walmart.",Negative
"Read the pilot in the summer last year. Good to see Peter Vack back on my screen (he was great in I Just Want My Pants Back). Am a classical music lover, so this is right in my wheelhouse. Pilot ending left me feeling a little cheated with the narrative if it happens too fast, but I would watch this.Amazon has to do a better job categorizing this stuff though. Transplant and Mozart are both serio-comedies or dramas with some comedic elements. These are not full on comedies like say an Eastbound and Down or a Parks & Recreation are. I would quantify &#34;The Rebels&#34; as a farce - thus comedy.",Positive
"The leads do a good job.  We are fond of Matthew Rys and Keri Russell's performance is very good.  She is convincing the agent with strong convictions.  We enjoyed the first season very much.  It's not HBO or AMC level, but I'd recommend to anyone looking for good TV.",Positive
"Don't be fooled - this is NOT the new Teen Titans. Not that there was anything wrong with that show, mind, but this program is decidedly not geared solely toward the younger generation. This is true despite the fact that it revolves around teenaged superheroes. For one thing, the adult Justice League is never far away from the action. Batman makes frequent appearances, Black Canary is the team's trainer, Captain Marvel is practically a member, and there's a slew of cameos by virtually every other prominent hero in the DC universe (and quite a few of the lesser-known ones). So if you were disappointed that ""Justice League Unlimited"" was being replaced by a show with a younger cast of characters, don't be.Unlike many other shows featuring teenaged characters, Young Justice actually makes good on its promise to show growth and character development in its cast. We see these kids struggling with realistic, believable issues as they seek to become worthy of the Justice League. Yes, there is some romance, but it's handled in a refreshingly subtle fashion. The humor is almost always spot-on. And aside from the characters, the plot is incredible. There's a strong emphasis on an overall story arc in which the stakes get higher every week - especially as we learn that nearly all our beloved young heroes have big secrets. There's an air of darkness to Young Justice, though I wouldn't say it ever quite gets oppressive enough to cost the show its family-friendly label. The drama is quickly building towards a climax that will shake the whole universe in which the show is based. So I recommend you start catching up now - you won't be sorry.",Positive
I loved Simon in the Guardian and he just seems to get better and better with each show. I do hope there will be a 6th season.,Positive
Actors are amazing.  Story lines are interesting but not overly challenging that you can't follow them.  Love this show so much!,Positive
"Constantly exploring the fading line between right and wrong  the good guys and bad guys hash it out with guns knives bottles fists and acerbic wit. The dialogue in this show is to die for, for the characters often literally.",Positive
So far show keeps with the great family theme. Just good old country fun for everyone. Enjoy!,Positive
"Putting aside that this was another film with unlikeable characters doing dumb things in an unexplained end-of-humanity non-plot, I was still hoping the Blu would have some stellar extras and picture quality (with all of the darks and shadows). Unfortunately, the special features are some of the worst inclusions I have seen on a film like this, and the only thing giving this some higher marks was the 7.1 DTS.The story follows four people wallowing through their idiocies in trying to survive some unknown catastrophe that leaves a city (played by Detroit - which was a better character than everyone here) devoid of people. Some bad CGI shadows follow them around trying to gobble them up sans their clothing. I would have to say some typecasting has to occur here when you have Hayden Christiansen walking around with a hood barely showing his face for several sequences, followed by someone holding a long green glow stick baring resemblance to a certain weapon Hayden might be carrying in some other franchise. But anyway, the supplements are all in lodef and I listed all of the bad ones first:* Alternate endings, 3 or 4 at 8:20 minutes. Please take my advice and skip these. They are no different except for one alternate camera angle and a different sunset - nothing changes from the film.* Revealing 7th Street (making of), 7:04 minutes. Talking heads & really bad insight by the cast on the film and story.* Creating the Mood of 7th, 7:04 minutes. They essentially took the cuts from the first one and made this longer one, but with reasons for why they chose Detroit. Which I have to say I am not sure if all of the reasoning made Detroit seem worse (""gothic"", ""Dead"" etc.), or they just didn't realize they were saying it.* Behind the scenes montage, 2:11 minutes. Several identical cuts from the other two quips, with no dialogue. Would be best as a workbook for the staff of the film, otherwise a complete skipper.* HDNet Promo, 4:19 minutes (In HD). The standard trailer length plug.* Fangoria Interviews, 2 @ 31 minutes. This was actually an insightful and thorough interview process and was better than the commentary. Thankfully, Brad takes up 22 minutes of the set and will be worth the watch for his fans. Jacob's lasts only a few minutes and the rest is clips of the film.* Dig Copy, not disc dependent.* Commentary, see Fangoria interview instead.I was not impressed with the film, the bad effects that shined through on BD, or the ending being given away on the cover art (so no surprise for me, that ending sucked anyway) but I was impressed with the 7.1 - maybe only getting used by the creature sounds at various times, but a nice immersion. English and Spanish subs, region A coded. Not worthy of a purchase but maybe a renter for the Hayden fans. 1.5 stars for the film, and 1.5 for the sound and Fangoria set.",Negative
"This was a great episode, but I may be biased because I think all of their episodes are great. And as a collector myself I always learn something new from these guys.",Positive
"It is a well-done TV series that can absorb cast changes and continue to deliver excellent shows.  NCIS Season Two ended with the shocking murder of Agent Caitlin Todd.  Season Three opens with two major cast additions.  Cote de Pablo joins the team as the beautiful and dangerous Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David, while veteran actress Lauren Holly, as Jenny Shepard, becomes the new director of NCIS.The changes put iconic Senior Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) in the awkward situation of working in a new agent while getting used to a new boss who is a former love interest.  The rest of the team, still grieving for Caitlin, are slow to embrace Ziva but will be won over by her obvious competence, and by her hilarious efforts to master American slang.  Wisecracking Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly)in particular will find that Ziva forces him to raise his game in a way that Caitlin never quite did.The exciting two-part season opener resolves the still-open case of Agent Todd's murder.  A two-part season ender places Gibbs' service with NCIS at risk.  The audience will learn more about Gibbs' past while contemplating another season-ending cliff-hanger.  In between, the team will handle serial killers, terrorists, and kidnappings with its usual mixture of brisk police procedural and entertaining repartee.  Six special features about the making of the show are included in the DVD set.  ""NCIS: The Third Season"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.",Positive
This is my favorite comedy on TV. I love everything about it. These guys are hilarious and very like able.,Positive
The characters and story lure the viewer from the first show.  It is unlike any western I've ever watched and I'm notparticularly a western fan.  I'm very much looking forward to season 3!,Positive
"TERMINATOR SALVATION: THE MACHINIMA SERIES was first launched as a web series comprised of six episodes, and chances are that if you've spent $1.99 per episode on iTunes, XBox Live, or wherever, then you may've thrown away some good green. For those in the dark (which was me, not too long ago), machinima, a term combining the words ""machine"" & ""cinema,"" is a cost-effective but still developing medium which utilizes video-game engines and characters to narrate its stories. In TERMINATOR SALVATION: THE MACHINIMA SERIES, the visuals are generated from the game engine of the Terminator Salvation video game. Regarding the quality of the graphics, the key words here are probably ""a still developing medium.""The super-sexy Moon Bloodgood lends her vocals to again play Resistance fighter Blair Williams, who in the live action film was either woefully underused or a mere afterthought. Here, she's fleshed out a bit and she takes on the kickasss action heroine role so prevalent in the Terminator franchise. Blair Williams is someone who remembers what life was like before Judgment Day, yet is still young and vibrant enough to adapt to her lethal post-apocalyptic environment and learn how to fight. In six episodes, we see her grit and resourcefulness and just how full of fight she is. I'm not clear on the exact timeline of this story. I've heard of this being touted as a prequel to TERMINATOR SALVATION, but I've also heard that this is actually set after TERMINATOR SALVATION but before the video game. Whatever the case, the story takes place in a ravaged Los Angeles sometime in 2016, with Blair Williams tasked with ferreting out the Ghost, an elusive entity which had been disrupting the Resistance's communication system.Die-hard fans may want to get this DVD to complete their collection, but others can probably make do without. Although there are tons of frantic chases and firefights with the Machines, the story itself isn't really that compelling and I don't think it at all enriches the Terminator mythos. But it's made even less relevant by the faulty animation. Not too surprisingly the look of the thing did make me feel as if I were in the middle of a video game. Thing is, the graphics don't really achieve, let alone maintain, a high level of quality. You know it's rough when the animators don't even try real hard to sync the lip movements of the characters with their dialogue.Bonus stuff on the DVD offers the Making Of TERMINATOR SALVATION: THE MACHINIMA SERIES featurette (which is an extensive breaking down of the machinima technology) and a Character Profile on Blair Williams which includes interviews with Moon Bloodgood who, I'll say it again, is super-sexy. 2.5 stars out of 5 for this one.",Negative
"History is so important in knowing where we have been and where we are going.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching and learning about the thinkers and doers who built America.  Since I was too young to know all the things that occurred years ago to bring such important ideas that launched the future of our country,  watching this has been extremely enlightening and interesting. I suggest if you haven't seen this, you should if you are interested in our country's history.  Opening our eyes to the past helps us understand how important men (women) with vision and means can have such an impact.  Highly recommend.",Positive
"The wheeling and dealing and double-crossing amongst these ppl...OMG!! I was so glad to see it come to Netflix since I got rid of cable before season 2. Once I saw season 2, I had to get it here. We couldn't stop watching. Even my husband got hooked. He will watch it without me, lol...",Positive

"Today marks the first day I've ever seen this show.  This is just an off-the-top-of-my-head review.The first scenario involved a husband who said his wife accidentally shot herself.  However, the forensics prove that she could not have done so.  The husband was a lawyer and he was having an affair with a judge.  That reminded me of the female astronaut who drove for eight hours wearing adult diapers.  The point is: people in prestigious professions sometimes do stupid things for love/lust just like the way a Jerry Springer guest would.I watch ""Forensic Files"" religiously.  I immediately began comparing/contrasting the two shows.  This show is twice as long, so I figured they must go into depth more.  However, they have two scenarios in many episodes.  So it's just like watching two consecutive episodes of ""Forensic Files"" which is ofte how it's aired on TruTV anyway.  In fact, the second scenario here was reported on ""Forensic Files.""  I could tell because they showed the white murder victim wearing traditional Japanese garb.  This makes me wonder if there aren't that many forensics-saved-the-case fact patterns in the world.  However, that may be a good thing if that means the murder rate is getting lower in this country.  This scenario showed a theme often relayed on ""Forencic Files"": single women who leave their doors open or are just moving in and violating men take advantage of them.  Single women: please lock your doors and windows as much as possible!  I think Polynesian guys are hot and they had a Polynesian interviewee here.  I also looooove butt chin and one interviewee has a butt chin so deep, he could compare to Kirk Douglas or Andy Dyck.This show is quite similar to ""Forensic Files"" and sometimes there's not too much of a good thing.",Negative
"The commander at the start of the movie caused me to see Captain Sheridan of Babylon 5.  When we're bringing in the Scotty person... they're actually from Firefly, not Star Trek.Ok, the Scotty boy went to see the obviously alien prisoner and had an explosive device that exploded causing quite a ship-wide catastrophe.Now this confused me A LOT.  Bang and everyone is still there?  Wait, wait, watch, wait... hey.... maybe that boom thing was a remote control because no one around it suffered a boom.  But the ship sure did.I'm going to give it 3 stars.  Start with 5, knock off one for being shorter than most TV episodes. Knock off another for confusion and worrisome acting.  The &#8220;special effects&#8221;....ah...  did someone pay the Babylon 5 make up guy some money? We do have a dangerous and sexy alien.The sexy skills of Alias star Jennifer Garner but in a Babylon 5 decked out type of alien.... who can essentially kick ass.  Just like they straight-out-told-you about the time of the &#8220;prisoner transfer&#8221;.I have a few questions though.  Why did the Firefly &#8220;Scotty&#8221; go bozo?  Well, never-mind.... lots of questions.This movie may have been a really cool episode of a really good science fiction series where there are plenty of episodes before and after this one.  This one, credit where credit is due, does conclude.  It didn't make me say, &#8220;Oh, yeah, now I get it!&#8221; but it was a conclusion that may spark some fun ideas... not unlike Alien with Sigorney Weaver.  Her real name is Susan, lets stop this Siggy nonsense.If you have an hour until dinner and you can get this on your 10 inch tablet in your kitchen... and you don't mind missing everything as you toss the salad while the casserole is cooking.  Good call.  You won't &#8220;get it&#8221; any better than I did but you'll feel like you got in a movie while making dinner.Never-mind that it isn't really &#8220;movie&#8221; length.  I have been unfair a bit though.  While I could criticize this thing until the cows come home, I don't feel like I wasted any of my time.  I think who ever put this together with (I hear) a limited budget, is someone who has the basics down on how to tell a story in film.  I think one day they will be widely recognized.  But not for this one.",Negative
"I am still relatively young into this new series, but what I have seen I am impressed.  I only gave it four stars because I have't seenenough yet to be really  critical.  I find the action accurate,  the cast very good (especially the women) and it holds my interest fromstart to finish.  I like especially the occasional connection with CHICAGO PD and the inter relationships between the two depts.I am a little disturbed by some political correctness is the emphasis of women as firemen; something I am against for physical as wellas psychological reasons.  Still, the cast is very good and I like everyone I have seen on both shows.  And the women do their jobswell.  I need to see more  to judge more critically but I think I am going to like these shows.  FIRE is a good change of pace fromall the other (some mediocre) crime and action shows.  My other favorites are CASTLE, BONES & THE MENTALIST.  But please,no more Dr Sweets!!  As one who was born in Illinois and started out in Chicago, I am glad to see more shows set in the Big Town;Indeed, it is My Kind of Town.  Of course I love NY where I live too.  Everything I get I buy from Amazon.",Positive
I didn't think I'd like this show but I'm hooked. Even if just to look at Simon I watched his other series the guardian it didn't last long this ones much better,Positive
What can I say except that it gets more interesting and the writers seem willing to take some serious broad strokes with the story and cast. Keep it up!CJ,Positive
"Believe follows the same pattern, the same idea, as Touch: a young child has the ability to read people, to solve their problems, etc.,and the bad guys are out to get her for there own use. The good guys are trying to protect her because she is important, she has a destiny. We have yet to she why she is important, why she has a destiny, but I expect that will be answered in later episodes. Maybe.Unlike Touch, it has too many problems. First, there is a man scheduled to be executed in thirty minutes who the good guys want to rescue because he is to be the protector of the young girl. How or why, we don't know. Instead of say &#34;Hell yeah, get me out of here&#34; he argues with the man who came in as a priest - how he got by the warden I don't know - until fifteen seconds before he gets jolted or juiced. A convenient trap door drops him into a sewer that takes him to a waiting car. Second, the rest of the show. A lady running through a hospital waving a gun and no one calls security? No one dials 911? A terrible fight that is an embarrassment to the stunt profession. Poor script, poor stunt work,  poor direction. If they correct these flaws it could be a good show because it has a good concept. A child with abilities who helps people. Like . . . oh, yeah, Touch.",Negative
"This one had it all!! I don't think the writers missed a single trick and made it work! I liked the first season a good bit, but this second season blew me away. Not for young kids (lots of blood and senseless violence).",Positive
Reasonably entertaining with decent acting and interesting story lines. Recommended for those who are into the genre as well as those with an interest in Ireland.,Negative
Great show. Very suspenseful and unpredictable!! Plots and subplots keeps you guessing. Only issue is that Emily's revenge demeanor is sometimes very Obvious.,Positive
I worried about this season. Could they keep the same level of interest as previous? Were they running out of ideas?Turns out no.  The show is fantastic. It's devloped new characters and given depth to old ones.,Positive

"Richard Gere is the best part of this film. In it he plays a billionaire who stands to lose everything because of a bad deal with a copper mine and so the lies come out as things go from bad to worse.Unfortunately most of the plot points were overly predictable but fortunately the performances were delivered better.Susan Sarandon plays the wife of Gere and you can tell early on that the couple is  disconnected one. Also starring Tim Roth as a police detective.A message of rich people getting away with it but it lacked any depth or twist or anything remotely interesting enough to push it above average. Also, you had Gere and Sarandon and that was the best you could do with them?The budget for this picture was not listed (always suspicious and likely that means a loss) and it made a bit over $22M at the Box Office.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C to C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; MORALITY FOCUSES/MESSAGE: C to C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus; WHEN WATCHED: early January 2013.",Negative

Mac messed up again and thought their service was going to be the only one on the block. Now I can buy .mp3 songs (unprotected) and video files with being stuck with crapmac software.

"After years of what felt like a collection of stale broadcast TV sitcoms, I was introduced to How I Met Your Mother. While I've never been a big fan of any particular sitcom, this show got me excited about the genre for the first time ever. I was introduced to it by my sister, who brought a borrowed copy of the third season on DVD home with her from college. I ended up watching a few episodes and was very pleasantly surprised by How I Met Your Mother -- it was absolutely hilarious. While I always thought that sitcoms were just full of overly used jokes and cardboard characters, How I Met Your Mother was not only funny and fresh, but felt like it had more depth than the typical sitcom. I was hooked.How I Met Your Mother has a unique storytelling style that continues into season four. The overarching story is being told by an older Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) to his children. The series consists of a series of flashbacks from Ted's 20s and 30s about the lives of himself and his friends living in New York City and, ultimately, how he met his future wife. This frame may seem complex, especially if you haven't tuned in from the beginning, but it's done in a breezy, comfortable manner that feels natural and doesn't confuse viewers. I felt like it was a story that my father could have been telling me because sometimes there are flashbacks within the overarching flashback and scenes and timing are not perfectly linear, which is more like how a person would share memories -- as they are triggered by something else, rather than chronologically.In season four, the gang continues to mature as they enter their 30s. Ted successfully proposes to Stella (Sarah Chalke), but is left at the altar. Ted fights to come to terms with it, and later reenters the dating scene after becoming roommates with ex-girlfriend Robin (Cobie Smulders). Ted is later laid off from his job, and he decides to begin his own architecture firm. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) struggles with growing feelings for Robin. While Barney continues his usual womanizing ways, tension grows between him and Robin as Barney's feelings start to come out. Meanwhile, Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan) move into their new apartment and struggle with whether or not they're ready to have children. Each character's world changes throughout the series, building up for more antics in season five.The cast of How I Met Your Mother does a perfect job of playing off one another, making the jokes and punch lines feel snappy and well-utilized. While many comedies run the risk of overdoing jokes, How I Met Your Mother does a fantastic job of balancing the joke surrounding an episode with all of the characters. By far, the best (and most hilarious) character in this show is the awe-(wait for it...)-some Barney Stinson with his unnamed corporate job, endless supply of suits, and constant bedding of various women. Barney is always up to something off-the-wall and funny, no matter what's happening in the lives of the other characters.The season four DVD set includes all 24 episode on three discs in widescreen format with English 5.1 Dolby Surround sound plus English, French, and Spanish subtitles -- not to mention a great selection of bonus features. These features include a recap of season three, episode commentaries, a gag reel, ""A Night with Your Mother"" special featuring an Academy of Television Arts & Sciences panel discussion, a hilarious gag video about how awesome Barney is, and an extended scene from ""The Fight.""Season four is another great chapter in the How I Met Your Mother saga. The series is just as humorous as when it first began, and the characters continue to be interesting and funny. The amazing thing for me about this series is how it can cover such a range of emotions in just one episode. I don't usually respond to TV or movies emotionally, but How I Met Your Mother can make me roll around laughing and takes me to the brink of tears in the same episode. I can't wait for the new season to start.",Positive
"One of the few good things on this show was actor Stephen Dorf.  Although this show had plenty of flaws, I kept watching primarily for him.  However, this was his last episode on the show and with that, I had completely had it with this reincarnation of one of my favorite shows, the original LAW AND ORDER set in NYC.  The problems with this show are manifold.  The worst is that it is trying to be a hybrid of the original show with a CSI show.  So instead of the excellence of a team which had Jerry Orbach and Sam Waterston in the gritty New York scene, there is this technicolor mess of a show trying to infuse us with the coolness of the hopped up LA scene.  All this is missing is the Horatio from CSI Miami with his sunglasses to cement it as a truly unbelievable show.  The CRIMINAL INTENT version of this show was also ruined by constantly reinventing a concept which worked.  It too became unwatchable with Jeff Goldblum at the helm.  My recommendation is to skip this show and stick to the reruns of the original, especially the ones with Waterston and Orbach in their primes.",Negative
"While the series is very loosely based on the events of the life of Henry VIII the performances by JR Meyers, Sam Neill as Wolsey, and Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More really make the piece.Natalie Dormer is pitch perfect as Anne, even if we can see through her and her family and find her annoying! Maria Doyle Kennedy as the Queen is superb. She is warm, human, dignified and we actually feel sorry for all the king is throwing away for a woman who ultimately proved to not be worth it. And how much he will destroy in England in the process.Henry as a 'sleeping lion' is wonderfully portrayed. The series starts and ends looking like a 'bonkbuster' but there is a LOT of interesting stuff that will pique your interest in the real history if you can get past the nudie bits.Squishing his 2 sisters into the one who marries his friend Charles Brandon was silly and pointless, and it is amazing they never once mention Scotland in the whole 10 hours! Margaret Tudor married the king of scotland, Mary the old senior King of France, not Portugal, and he died 3 months later.The Thomas Tallis parts were just silly, and partly for shock value and more sex, but I think they were trying to show a bit about the 'common man'.The scenes between Henry and Anne light up the screen--it is interesting to see the contrast with the second series, when they are barely in the same county, let alone room. (GREAT acting in both).The costumes, settings and acting make this, while not perfect, certainly an excellent way to savor history and the period.",Positive
I choose this rating cuz this season of heroes was amazing. the episodes never messed up with amazon and everything went just fine I would recommend this show to everyone,Positive
"Hurray! SyFy has done something right for a change in this smart, time-travelling police procedural that mixes crime-of-the-week drama with an overarching terrorist-catching theme.The pilot wastes no time in getting down to business and quickly establishing the major characters and what's going on. Rachel Nicols shines as the cop from the future whose zapped back from 2077 to present day, fortunately bringing a ton of cool gadgets to keep sci-fi geeks happy and providing some unusual plot twists. Thanks to her Terminator-like Google Glasses overlay and high tech superhero suit, everyone around her looks positively low tech. Erik Knudson is excellent as the present day whizz kid who helps out our hero and Victor Webster brings chemistry as the cop sidekick.It's actually one of the smarter shows on TV that casts the terrorists as partially sympathetic characters who have come back through time to prevent the takeover of democracy by corporations. The writers make full use of all the tricks that time travel allows, establishing characters 'then and now' and each week showing a little more about their motivations. But for all its cleverness, there are occasionally some really bad expository scenes and dialog from characters that's only there to explain the plot to the audience. The intro credits are also some of the worst on TV but thanks to my DVR I don't have to suffer though those. These minor problems aside, its well-paced and executed and about as good as gets for TV sci-fi.",Positive
"Cowboy Sheriff, based I'm presuming on a series of books.Likeable cast, plots ramble all over the place.  See the town is close to an Indian Reservation and they manage to bring in some Native Indian rituals, superstitions, etc. at least in the first two series.(Basically murder mysteries, makes one wonder the size of the graveyards in these towns.  I always wondered how the graveyards in Cabot Cove (Murder She Wrote), must dwarf the size of the town...  Getting to be the same thing here.  Although they do burn the bodies in above ground Indian Crematoriums, so there's that.).Anyway, sometime in the past the Sheriff's wife was killed;  He indicated to the townsfolk that it was death from cancer, but instead it was some sort of stabbing.  So, a lot of the plot slowly (and I do mean slowly) rotates around that base mystery.Acting, not the worst, when it's got it's game on (about 3/4 of the time) the plots manage to make sense, and have a bit of surprise in them.  Character development is an on-going affair.It's like waiting for the race car to leave the starting line.  You suspicion it is a fine car, could win a race, but so far it's been in neutral with someone revving the engine every once in awhile.Slow paced (did I mention that?), and from that perspective sort of relaxing and enjoyable.  Other than the whole murder thing.",Negative
Part of fun of this show is the realism. The scenery; the old vehicles; the buildings;  the rural areas and even the police station although they closed the old station. The cast is great and actually look like real people. The mysteries are fun to watch although the guilty party(s) is/are usually not one of the main suspects. All-in-all this whole series is a great.,Positive
"This was a very good episode. It was mostly focused on the Don/Sally relationship. Its somewhat a step on a long road toward honesty on both sides. Sally has rather unexpectedly (at least to me) become perhaps the one person Don can be honest with and be himself with. There is lots of interesting ways that could develop during the remainder of the series. It grows out of the basic point made in season six. That nearly all the people around Don don't want honesty or the real thing.Sally walking into the office and finding Don gone followed in a long series of Sally ""disappointment"" moments in the series. But how it evolved and Don reached out to her honestly this time made it both different and very meaningful. Don's motivation for his personal paralysis being revealed as a desire to somehow ""fix things"" was also good. I enjoyed the bits where Don just can't escape the business down to wanting to know seating arrangements in meetings.On the not so good side, dragging Pete back into more GM stories doesn't seem interesting. They need to find something for Peggy to do in story terms other than being angry and frustrated. I'm also not so sure that a partner in a firm with the title ""head of personnel"" would be an inferior downstairs position compared to someone in accounts. The pullback in Pete's appearance and behavior from the first episode was a bit odd as well.",Positive
I love this version of Pride and Prejudice. To me Colin Firth is Mr Darcy and I could watch it every week.,Positive
"I watched this twice, to make sure I really got it and to test my perceptions of it.  The first time, I watched it in big blocks of three hours over consecutive days and got very tired of it, kind of waiting to get to Caesar's assassination for it to end.  The second time, I watched each episode separated by a few days, and it was much much better that way.  Like all good films, I saw much more and am sure that it will get even better with subtleties and nuance on repeated viewings.The plot follows Caesar as he ends the Gallic War, crosses the Rubicon as a revolutionary (or demagogue or psychopath or whatever), and becomes dictator, ending with his murder.  However, rather than a single character, such as Claudius in I Claudius, the story omnisciently follows several lives of those revolving around Caesar.  You have aristocrats (supporters and opponents), soldiers, and the normal riff-raff of Rome.  In many ways, the main character really is Rome itself, as Caesar is at best a shadowy figure, while the others appear and reappear suddenly.The principal characters are the honorable Centurion Vorenus and his troublesome sidekick, the brutal legionnaire  Pullo.  They are entirely fictional, and while the actors that portray them are very good, they came off as a bit of a plot device, to get the viewer into certain places and to illustrate things that were occurring.  They pop up in Caesar's last major Gallic battle, scramble for work in ROme, join Caesar's civil war effort in Greece and Egypt, then return to seek new careers in Rome.  They stumble across Pompey, Cleopatra, and Octavian (the future Augustus), all the while rather oblivious to the true meaning of events unfolding around them, even though Vorenus becomes a Senator.  That being said, the intrigues that weave their way through the story are quite fun, and while embellished as all historical fiction must be, accurate in the outline of events as we know them.  You also have the aristocrats (actual historical figures, though with added fictional details) of Atia and Servilia; they are mortal enemies, both connected to Caesar and intriguers that are as cold as they come.I did not need to watch this to learn the history, though it would definitely be good for that.  For me, the greatest pleasure is the painstaking accuracy of the portrayal of Rome and life at that time.  The viewer is served a host of wonderful images, vivid colors, and very well drawn characters.  You can not only smell Rome, but feel the chaos and fear that convulsed the city at this time.  Then there is the manner in which people lived, evocations of their non-Christian religious beliefs and rituals, the conditions in which slaves lived, and the character of the Roman aristocrat, who would resignedly accept death for the sake of honor or as the price for risking political gain.  It is truly wonderful, and the bonus disk has excellent mini-documentaries that explain much of it.  (I did find inaccuracies, such as the claim that ""anything goes"" sexually - the Romans were notorious homophobes, for example - but these were very few.)Warmly recommended.  While the story and drama are not as tight as in I Claudius, it is an absolutely first-rate evocation of a vanished world.",Positive

"The sherlock genre is so overdone that i thought there was no chance i would watch this show.  however, that was before i reckoned on johnny lee miller as sherlock. i think what is really working here is that this is the first time that someone has been cast as sherlock who is actually very appealing to women. this is of course deviating substantially from the arthur conan doyle sherlock, or so one would think.  because somehow miller otherwise remains very true to the sherlock on the page.  i have never seen this mix before. miller is much more versatile than i originally supposed.  he was anything but attractive playing the villain on dexter a few seasons ago.  he was quite good as a villain and not at all appealing.the show is clever too.  the scene pictured is sherlock working on corpses in the morgue for his equivalent of a body farm like lab exercise.  he is trying various killing maneuvers on the corpses.lucy liu is working as watson and i think the main reason she is is because the role is written and she is playing it very understated.  watson is always second banana to sherlock and any attempt to disrupt that would be disastrous.  but watson is also the voice of sanity when sherlock goes off the reservation.this episode involves exposing an angel of death in a hospital, who is killing terminal patients. there is an interesting twist to this episode which exposes another evildoer which is unexpected.",Positive
"A little convoluted... this story of how Gianni Versace was the victim of a serial killer suffers from a lot of expositional dialogue. The writers seem to struggle to fit Gianni's epic life into two hours, plus tell the story of his murder. They almost could've made two movies, his tale is so mythic. It's both glamorous and sad, and his death affected his family for years after it occurred.I think they still have another, better movie about his death out there (with a bigger budget), but this is worth a Sunday afternoon. The book was SO much, much better! THAT was truly a blockbuster of a book, with details on his childhood, building his business, his lovers, fashion shows and parties, family quarrels over his inheritance, and finally, his demise.",Negative

"How our ancestors suffered, even a bare hundred years ago, whether they were the patients or the staff of the biggest charity hospital for the poor in turn of the century London. Medicine was advancing in 1906, just not fast enough to stem the tide of suffering brought on by injury and disease aided and abetted by poverty. Asepsis (sterile and clean conditions) had been discovered and developed as had chloroform and ether as surgical anesthetics, primitive (and dangerous) x-ray technology, but antibiotics, intravenous solutions, imaging technology that didn't kill the patient on its own and a simple sugar and water solution to keep people from dying from dehydration were decades in the future, along with many, many other things.The body had been well anatomized and diseases were documented and described. The problem was the paucity of treatments that worked. The brave men and women who tried to turn the tide are everyday heroes and should remind us of the nurses who still take care of us.People suffered from birth defects, malnutrition, infectious diseases, diseases of aging and poverty, industrial accidents and gang warfare all of it grimed in a coat of dirt and vermin that the nurses struggled to stem. Every, every, everything was dirty at a time when cleaning required ten times the work it does today. Nurses were also expected to be married to the hospital, not allowed to marry or see a man romantically and this went on to the forties.The stories in London Hospital are all taken from life be it newspaper articles, hospital records or personal memoirs. The producers have also gone to some trouble to make the procedures and illnesses real in a stomach churning, toe curling manner. Other reviewers have criticized this as an attempt to shock. I agree it is shocking, but it is necessary to have even a prayer of taking the viewer back to the genuine suffering of this era. Drama with the staff is interspersed with the cases but London Hospital is a piece of medical history that is profound in its depiction and its implications. Very highly recommended but not for the faint of heart. Many of the medical scenes are truly grisly and watching the dead die all over again is affecting. I loved Call the Midwife, but I have never seen anything like London Hospital. An original.",Positive

"Took the time and watched all the way through. It's good, but nothing new.

Still, they had me when they trotted out the piece about the largest ball of twine-- vindicating my use of that obscure bit for years. The headlines and punch lines came so fast I didn't have the time to process them to remember for this review. Could they keep up the pace for a multi-episode series? Jeffery Tambor is in his element as the over-the-top ego-driven anchor. A real send up of the news business (emphasis on business) that does the Web site version of the Onion proud.",Positive
"When I first heard of the idea of this show, I scoffed at the idea.  I figured their wouldn't be any way they could possibly make a show like this entertaining.  I am grateful to be mistaken.  This had me hooked from the beginning of the first episode.",Positive
"I chose the rating of 3 stars for this movie because I went into it with far higher expectations mostly due to the 4 & 5 star ratings that other reviewers gave. I was let down by the plot, but the premise and emotional value somewhat made up for that.This movie starts with the sponsorship of a 6 year old girl in China by an Australian man who undoubtedly (thankfully) believed he would be helping an orphaned child. This child was able to go to school and live better in her orphanage. She and Mr. Randell have a prolific exchange of letters and postcards over a ten-year period.No spoilers here, but as you can read in the description that the girl at age 16 has the opportunity to meet her sponsor...and she arrives uninvited. What she finds, in her words, make &#34;everything all wrong&#34; .The girl, who lacks a real name as she couldn't remember it when she arrived at the orphanage is called Mei Mei, meaning Little Sister. This is an important aspect of the movie. The rest of the movie relies upon this small bit to carry out the duration.There are two-bit gangster wanna-be bad guys who run a two-bit mafia-like organization. However, they are not portrayed very menacingly and therefor, in my opinion, really just look and act like older bullies from middle school.A lot of reviewers on here also stated the movie was too 'disturbing' and 'violent'. One even said they could only watched for twenty minutes due to these reasons. So I watched for anything that might indicate these statements to be true, and there absolutely was not one thing. No nudity, no sexual activity, no violence obviously defined except for a couple fist fights and implied 'messing you up bad' bully statements.The biggest thing I got out of this movie was the understanding that a good deed may come with a false underlying story and that even though the truth will avail, there is always room for forgiveness, love and a future.I would say: Watch this one. It won't waste your time. Its a bit teary schmaltzy ay the end, which makes it feel like a better movie than it was.",Negative

"I'm really sorry to Danielle Harris, I love her but this movie is not that good.  In fact it's pretty dumb, had some okay scenes and a decent premiss but it just didn't deliver on the shocks.  It's just not really thrilling, kinda boring and only good for a one time watch, if that.  I can't recommend this.  The only reason I gave it three stars is because it had some good special effects for the torture scenes.",Negative
"This is a hard one to review since clearly this is a continuing storyline that's starting with a slow burn. The brooding, break the rules detective has been done to death but there's something about Titus Welliver's demeanor that makes Bosch interesting and not just broody. There are a lot of elements at play here that could go either way. The loyal but warry partner, the Showboat ex-girlfriend ME, The world weary but cool Coroner, the tough but fair female lieutenant and the slick but not sure which way he blows captain are all stereotypes but well played.I'd definitely watch a few more episodes because I think this show will grow over time.",Positive
This one of the best programs I have ever seen.  It is family friendly with no swearing and no sex scenes.  It's extremely interesting seeing inside the SRU and seeing how they solve the cases.

"I just finished watching this movie, I thought it was fairly good, but I was not planning on writing a review until I came here and read some of the negative reviews (I like to read reviews after watching a movie to see what other people thought). After reading the negative reviews I have a desire to respond briefly to the two major complaints that people seemed to have with the movie, 1) that it was boring, and 2) that the character arc of Willem Dafoe's character was not believable. Before I respond to those critiques, however, my conscience forces me to provide at least a brief summary of the movie and why I thought it was worth watching, in order to justify the fact that I am writing a review at all.The movie is about a hunter, played by Willem Dafoe, who is hired by a corporation to track down the last remaining Tasmanian Tiger in order to retrieve its DNA, and possibly a toxin that it uses to subdue or kill its prey. Dafoe's character is a loner, but when in Tasmania he is forced to stay with a family. The mother of the family is distraught over the recent disappearance of her husband and spends all her time sleeping, but Dafoe interacts with her two children, a daughter and a son. The movie moves back and forth between scenes with Dafoe on his own in the woods trying to track the Tasmanian Tiger, and scenes with him interacting with the family. There is also a conflict between environmentalists, who are attempting to get a ban placed on logging in the area, and the loggers who are threatened with unemployment if the environmentalists succeed. Dafoe's character gets caught in the middle of the conflict because the loggers take him to be a ""greenie"".That is a basic description of what the movie is about, and I must admit, when I read the description the movie did not sound all that exciting to me. The movie managed, however, to hold my interest once I started watching. This is not an action movie, there are not a lot of tense action sequences. In fact, there are none. That may be why so many people thought the movie was boring. If you are looking for a Rambo style action flick than I would definitely recommend taking a pass on this movie. There are other things besides action, however, that make a movie interesting and engaging, and this movie does a good job at setting up a number of mysteries that hook in the viewer. What happened to the father who disappeared? Who is responsible for setting up the camera, and other hanging objects, in the woods? Is there really still a Tasmanian Tiger out there, or is it really extinct? There is also the whole conflict between the environmentalists and the loggers which threatens to explode and creates tension in the movie. And, of course, there is the heart of the movie: Dafoe's relationship with the family, and especially the kids. All in all, I would not consider this to be one of the best movies I have ever seen, but it certainly held my interest, and it was a lot better than most of the movies that get made these days.Now I will try to quickly respond to the two complaints. I have already responded, to some degree, to the first complaint that the film is boring. The pace of the movie is slow, that is undeniable. If you do not like slow paced movies than you should not watch this one. But like I said, there is plenty in the movie that is capable of grabbing and holding the viewer's interest despite its lack of action packed car chases.The second complaint that everyone seems to have with this movie is that Dafoe's character arc is not believable. This complaint was made not only by reviewer's here on amazon, but also by professional reviewers on the site Rotten Tomatoes. I find this complaint somewhat puzzling because it seems to me to be based on a false premise. I think people find the character arc unbelievable because they make the character's transformation more extreme than it really is. They often talk as if Dafoe's character at the beginning of the movie was an evil loner, perhaps an assassin type character, and that at the end of the movie he is a fully reformed character. There is, however, as far as I can tell nothing in the movie that would suggest that Dafoe's character at the beginning of the movie is in any way ""evil"", unless you assume that anyone who is willing to work for a corporation, or anyone who hunts for a living is ""evil"". There is also no indication that the character is a saint by the end of the movie. SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT READ PAST THIS SENTENCE IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE ENDING REVEALED.In fact, the character still kills the Tasmanian Tiger once he finds it. The character does, however, refuse to give the remains to the corporation, and I read one review by a professional critic who considered that completely unbelievable. I do not think there is anything unbelievable about it at all. The company that Dafoe's character was working for had just murdered the woman he was staying with, along with her daughter, or, it is at least clear that Dafoe believes that the corporation was responsible for their deaths (he says to Sam Neill's character ""they just sent a replacement for me...""). What would have been unbelievable is if Dafoe's character had been so heartless as to continue working for his previous employers once it became clear they were willing to murder innocent people to get what they wanted. There is nothing in the set up of Willem Dafoe's character which would suggest that he is fine with killing innocent people.I just do not think that the character transformation is as large as these critics are assuming. There is, of course, a character transformation, but I think it is from someone who is extremely solitary to someone who begins to show a minimal interest in other people's lives. That is not really a giant leap in my opinion. I think Dafoe's transformation is entirely believable given the circumstances (I apologize that I keep referring to the character by using the name of the actor but I am too lazy to look up the character name). It would be hard to stay with a family whose father/husband had just gone missing and not feel some sympathy, especially for the children. You would have to be inhuman not to, and like I said, there is no reason to believe that Dafoe's character is inhuman at the beginning of the movie or incapable of human sympathy. The fact that he spends his time listening to opera suggests that he is a human being who is quite capable of feeling genuine human emotions. He is not a sociopath. So, contrary to what so many people seem to think, I do not find anything unbelievable in the character arc of Willem Dafoe's character. Personally, I do not think that ""realism"" should be the primary ideal of art. What would be the point of an art-work that was just a carbon copy of reality? I did not, however, see anything in this movie that I thought stretched the bounds of believability beyond a reasonable point. In fact, I would say this is probably one of the more realistic movies I have ever seen. Certainly much more realistic than most Hollywood blockbusters.Whether you will like this movie will, however, depend on your tastes.",Positive

"It's true that I love Asylum Blackout, but it's not without several very noticeable faults.  I'm sure I'm forgetting several in my review.  For one, it takes forever for the movie to get going and once it *does* get going, it feels like it ends way too soon.  Also, the employees that work at the asylum are suspiciously unarmed and defenseless for some bizarre reason, which doesn't make sense given the psychotic nature of the inmates.  This also doesn't make sense since the guys that work there are more like clueless punks only there to cook meals for the inmates, at least, that's the initial impression.  This makes you think it's not necessary to really care about their fate when the time comes (and trust me, you know it's coming- it's only a matter of when).I mean *every single one* of the dangerous criminals are completely psychotic and beyond the point of being unreasonable, so they obviously have nothing to lose.  Under these conditions, you'd need the best kind of protection available to assure your safety but... apparently not in this asylum.  Strange.Obviously the inmates were made so psychotic for the purpose of delivering a suspense/horror movie.  Regardless of these issues, the final 30 minutes is pretty darn entertaining.  This is when the employees basically spend their time tucking and hiding under tables and inside storage rooms, and anywhere they can just to escape the army of crazy criminals released after a blackout locks everyone inside.  These bad boys are motivated to destroy as much of the asylum as possible... and that's another flaw.  Wouldn't you want to capture and kill the employees if you're an asylum?  After all, you'd want to get rid of anything that could possibly stand in the way of your persuit of escaping.  Then again maybe the inmates intention was never to escape after all and just go crazy on everything around them?I have to ask, who in their right mind would EVER create an asylum under these conditions?  The electric goes out, all criminals are released?  It's hilarious to think such a scenario is possible. Also, the segments involving a phone hitting the head of one of the main characters and still working perfectly fine... and later the phone call to the cops where the cop for whatever reason doesn't seem interested or lacks the proper attention span to understand a man CLEARLY and desperately explaining the emergency situation over the phone... a typical trait of horror movies is to be totally clueless and lack logic on the part of the helpful folks, of course.  Can't have the good guys making an easy escape can we?  These are all flaws that should have been changed before the movies release in my opinion.However I still firmly stand behind my 5-star rating.  The final 30 minutes drastically picks up concerning the entertainment level as violent deaths occur one after another, along with people getting burned, tortured, stabbed and even decapitated.  All wonderful additions to a horror movie and totally appropriate for a movie about inmates escaping and running wild.  The atmosphere is decent towards the end too, especially when the employees run for their lives only to reach a dead end on a couple occasions.  A feeling of dread and concern for their safety occurs for you the viewer, which is a beautiful piece of writing and even looks frightening on TV.Great movie, regardless of the weak low budget acting and the hit or miss storytelling that takes a while to get underway.  Also regardless of that one song that plays a couple times (most notable during the credits) that sounds like it's copying the mid 70's period of the Kinks directly (and I KNOW it's ripping off another 70's song too- if only I could figure out which one, hmmm).  I highly recommend this movie, but don't expect anything greater than typical Hollywood exaggerated suspense.  Do NOT expect a bunch of logical situations either.",Positive

Honestly I almost passed on watching this one and in some ways wish that I had. This is obviously aimed at women and I think they were successful in finding their target audience as only the women in our household liked this show.

"I'm not usually a fan of the found footage genre.  The shaky cinematography is more distracting than exhilarating, and I've never been able to get past the lunacy of filming oneself in full fledged panic.  However, in the case of The Den, the setup is totally plausible and the lead characters obsession with her web cam and cell phone could just as easily be anyone living in the 21st century.The premise is simple.  A woman is awarded a grant to interact with as many people online as she possibly can over the course of several months. Think Jane Goodall and the apes only this time it's human beings and the internet.  Naturally it doesn't take her long to find throngs of horny boys, viral videos and ultimately one really disturbed individual happily committing snuff films online.  I remember when Faces of Death was the most controversial thing you could find. Nowadays, you can view as much depravity as you're willing to search for, and a great deal of it is very, very real.  If there is a lesson to be learned from The Den, it may be that very technology that seems to connect us is really nothing more than an invitation to behave at our worst.  In this film, the faceless anonymity it offers opens some very dangerous doors.This film got the hairs standing upon the back of my neck from the first frame and just never let go.  Highly recommended.-The Horror Within",Positive

He does not just read a script he acts with his whole body, his facial and eye expressions are remarkable, as are Emily Bett Richards!!",Positive
"Interesting Brit Com. You don't always get the references, but it's always interesting.  And the characters don't lie to each other; they like each other.  What a lovely change of pace.  Also, it's written for adults, not kids, and it's comforting to watch for people over a certain age.Judy Dench is MARVELOUS.",Positive
"I have enjoyed every episode of all three years of this show and am happy to own all three seasons. Each episode is extremely well made and continues Mr. Olyphant's Lou Gehrig like record of appearing in only excellent movies and television shows. I have yet to see anything that Mr. Olyphant has appeared in that wasnt superb from ""Hitman"" to ""Crazies"" to the Justified Television Series.Of course this years episodes as well as the two preceeding it come with my highest recommendations. View everyone if there is any way for you to do so.",Positive
"This is a very arty film that's slow in lots of places and really madly violent and fun in other places, its a bit 50/50 really, the story is there but takes a while to shape and has lots of boring pointless scenes where not much happens or you have to think about the deeper meaning of the scene in some arty twisted way that just hurts your brain really as the movie would have been better more simplified as appose to trying to be clever, the best moments are the scenes of violence, they are very strong and very graphically gory most of the time, so plenty of blood splashing, the cast is ok, Gosling is rather wooden again, it worked with drive but not every film he's in, Kristin Scott Thomas gave the best performance as his mother she is very good! Drive will always be Goslings and the directors best film, this is certainly worth checking out once but you may not return to it, the ending is very lacking too, there was no satisfaction in it after such a long drag through the bloody streets of Bangkok, its a neon light painted arty bloody mess, make of it what you will but its not a masterpiece.",Negative
Just keeps me guessing over and over. plot change direction very quickly. Has me waiting for whats next. This is the kind of show you can watch and then come back a month or 2 later and its new because yo see what you missed.,Positive
"Exterminator Alex Mathis (Greg Grunberg) likes women and loathes fruitcake. Through a series of improbable circumstances he gets to fight an aggressive BA spider along side of the US military with a Mexican sidekick.In a number of scenes Grunberg reminded me of Kevin James and I had a few John Goodman flashbacks. The film had blood and cheesy props (notice the thanks to Lloyd Kaufman in the credits) . The &#34;horror&#34; aspect simply didn't exist. Overly accomplished, relatively unknown Clare Kramer provided the love interest.Great for cheese lovers.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Bikini girls being chased by BS spider.",Positive
"This is a tough premise to believe, and to accept, that a dirty cop would be put in this position.  But of course, it theoretically occurred in a deal with a dirty politician....  yet, this actor does a great job, and I have liked his coarse but intelligent portrayals in other shows, such as in Castle.  Try it... if you like tough cop shows, this may work for you.",Negative
Outstanding show. And season 2 has started just as good.,Positive
This film was charming but I have read numerous books and research about this subject so did not find it as interesting as I had hoped. But for a first time introduction to near death experience I think it is an excellent production and viewers with no prior knowledge or experience of this subject matter would totally enjoy.,Negative
"This is an independent horror drama from director and writer Ben Wheatley who has worked with comedians Steve Coogan and Jonny Vegas in the past, but this one does not have a foot in the realm of comedy. It is about two old army buddies, who decided to become hit men after their country no longer needed them. We join Jay (Neil Marshall) a year after a bungled job in Kiev. His acerbic wife Shell (played with brilliant complexity by MyAnna Buring) tells him all their money is gone, as he has not done any `work' for a year. He meanwhile only wants to cure his back in their hot tub; she insists he is making it all up and there is nothing wrong with him.Then his old mucker turns up, Gal (Michael Smiley). They are having a dinner party and Gal has brought his latest flame Fiona, a mysterious one indeed who seems to enjoy pentangle like symbols. Well after a mass row, Gal invites Jay to go back to work. They agree and set off to meet their client. He gives them a hit list that includes a priest a librarian and an MP. They are not told their crimes and so Jay lets his imagination fill in the blanks. He is still traumatised from past experiences and seems to find some form of mental rehabilitation through inflicting violence. This he goes at with some very worrying gusto indeed.What unfolds gets darker and darker as the violence escalates and things are seen in their true light. This is one from the school of seventies horror with a sort of cross between the classic `The Wicker Man'and Peter Fonda's lost classic `Race with the Devil' . There is plenty of disturbing violence, language that a docker would baulk at and some brilliantly tense scenes. The soundtrack works too, even though at first I felt it was trying to be too spooky with echoey voices all over the place. By the end you will not notice as everything coalesces to a climax that kept me guessing.Not a straight forward horror as there is a lot of life drama too and some exploration of the mental luggage that people acquire who have been in stressful situations. All of the acting was above par and a lot is left unexplained, in that you automatically fill in the gaps. I actually thought this was really good. Also a note on funding, this was a collaboration with the UK Film Council and Channel 4 who should be praised for their involvement, it's a shame the Council is being abolished. If you like the new wave of Brit horrors then this is up there with the better ones.",Positive
"Didn't think I was going to like it but every week I look forward to the next episode and now I'm on the third Season. Sheriff Longmire is a respectable hero. I love how sensitive and emotional he can be, besides being a hunk. Longmire has some interesting cases that come up and then there is his own private life in which there is also a fascinating murder mystery.",Positive
It starts out slow but the characters become more interesting and likeable. Tarzan boiling his undies in the community pot is classic and worth watching the whole season.,Negative
"What a nice change of pace to get a show that combines panache, wit and turn-of-phrase in a drama that never loses steam. Almost every single character in this show is believable, interesting, portrays their storyline with flair and conviction - and so far I haven't found an episode that bored me. Truly a great show that I hope will continue along the same formula and not do what happened to Mad Men by pandering to the lowest form of &#34;entertainment&#34;.",Positive
"This must be the best thing on Television that I've seen in years. Love it! Gritty, Riveting, Tense. A must see show for anyone who loves to watch characters react to each other and the world around them.",Positive
"This is entertaining for both young teenagers and up through older adults - probably kids too. I tries it out and was soon sucked in by the excellent character actors, most of all Veronica. each epidode has multiple plots and sometimes there are great 2 episode stories. Everything links back to an overall plot to keep you interested.",Positive
"Though I cannot approve of all of the content (like glimpses of nudity), I nevertheless totally enjoyed it. They did a good job retelling the old story in modern times.",Positive
"As an American, there is more about British culture that I don't totally get than I would have thought.  Of course I have no idea how &#34;real&#34; this show is, but it is fascinating to watch - to observe the differences.  Characters are well developed, and brilliantly acted.  The mysteries keep you guessing.  What more could you ask for?",Positive
"If you thought the first season was gut wrenching and mind blowing, the second season one-ups the first.  Sex, drugs and rock and roll sum up the scenes from this season.",Positive
"Without a doubt, one of the best parts of How I Met Your Mother is Neil Patrick Harris's very randy Barney. It's amazing how he gets involved in Lily and Marshall's nanny search. But it's just one example of how the show successfully ties the problems of one couple or character into those of the others.",Positive
"Odds were pretty much against the show when the principles gave in to their romantic attraction for each other as it's been the death of more than one popular show in the past. However, exceptional scripts by writers who not only know their craft, they love their characters--and actors who return the love with quality performances every episode--have added dimension and depth, enhancing a great show and exceeding the hopeful expectations of its fan base.",Positive
"It's taken a bit for my ears to understand the Scottish (I think) accent, but even if I don't understand all the words I love the rhythm of it all. The plots are well done and the characters are developing episode by episode. Brenda Blethyn is just a fantastic actress, and I'm hoping there's a Series 3 soon.",Positive
I likem all but the swamp ledginShelby is the best glad he got his own show lol ha ha ha,Positive
"Imagine a cross between ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Murder She Wrote,"" set in a quaint Maine town where weird things happen every week.That's the best description I can come up with for ""Haven,"" a paranormal crime show very loosely adapted from Stephen King's novel ""The Colorado Kid."" The first season starts off on a rather mediocre note with a string of one-off ""troubles,"" but slowly develops a mysterious arc that grows more intriguing and powerful as time passes.FBI agent Audrey Parker (Emily Rose) is sent to the town of Haven to find an escaped murderer... but as soon as she arrives, she finds that the guy is dead... and his death was physically impossible.Not only does Haven have some bizarre people and strange weather patterns, but Audrey finds that she has a connection to the place -- an old photo with a woman who looks just like her. So she decides to stay in Haven, and partners up with local cop Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryan) to solve local crimes while she searches for hints to her past.However, it turns out that the ""troubles"" are returning to Haven after thirty-ish years -- mysterious aging, outbreaks of madness and sanity, spontaneously rotting food, horrible deaths related to artwork, a shadowy ""Dark Man"" (no, not the one Stephen King fans are thinking of!), a deadly shapeshifter, fiery deaths, a poltergeist and countless ground cracks.""Haven Season 1"" takes a little time to bloom. At first the acting is stiff, the one-off plots are ordinary, and there's no strong overarcing plot except ""the troubles are back!"" But as time goes by, the stories get darker and the writing becomes more compelling -- especially since only some of the mysteries center around stuff you can arrest people for.Each episode introduces a new bizarre occurrence, and has Nathan and Audrey trying to unravel whose powers are going out of control. These mysteries are fairly clever, and there are some funny moments sprinkled in every episode (""I need a HUUUUUGG!""). And despite being based on a King novel, most of it isn't horrifying -- there are some creepy moments, such as a poor guy's eyes, ears and mouth slowly sealing up before our eyes. Eww.Emily Rose is kind of stiff in the first few episodes, but she becomes a really likable heroine by the halfway point of the series -- she's strong, compassionate, playful and has some shocking secrets of her own. Bryan plays Nathan as reclusive and quiet, mainly because he can't physically feel anything. And there are some solid side performances by Eric Balfour as a charming smuggler, Nicholas Campbell as the gruff sheriff, and Anne Caillon as Nathan's girlfriend.""Haven"" hasn't fully unfolded into the great show it might become, but the first season shows it starting to really bloom -- and leaves you wanting more.",Positive
I love this adult cartoon. I laughed out loud sometimes watching it. It was well written programming. The characters were entertaining.,Positive
"This show has a well worn plot.  The ousted good guy who is on his own and ends up trying to save the town, the county, the world because his good side wins out over the old selfish nature. The twist for this show? Instead of your normal ethnic races of earth they threw in some aliens for the big diversity card. Ho Hum.",Negative
"Thank you, Amazon, for portraying a middle-to-upper class Jewish family in a dirty, gritty, yucky way.  Which next ethnic stereotype are you going to break?  Asians?  Are you going to do a series where they aren't cast as smart?I was drawn to this because of Jeffrey Tambor who always plays quirky characters with gusto.  He did not fail in his gusto for playing an advanced, middle-aged, bald man who is either a cross-dresser and/or wants to transition from male to female.  The three adult-children are all freaky and creepy.  I didn't like this for the same reason I didn't like the movie, &#34;August: Osage County&#34; -- while the acting was superb, watching a really screwed up family was beyond weary.Personally, I want shows that make me laugh (The Millers), make me happy (Glee), feel original (Seinfeld) (Glee), inform me (Jon Stewart), impress me with their acting (Big Bang Theory) (3rd Rock from the Sun).  This did none of the above.  I really don't want to see a married woman lusting for her college lesbian lover.  I don't want to see the son disrespecting women and doing whatever freaky thing that was alluded to in the mystery surprise scene.  I definitely want to remove the memory of Tambor in drag.This the 4th Amazon Original that I'm trying.  So far, Alpha House, is the only one that I like.  The rest will not bring me back for a 2nd viewing.  Oh, um, I probably will stop sampling these at 4.  I'm done.",Negative
"Love this series overall but a few episodes have been a bit dull,- that said I love all the characters and the acting is always excellent. I think they need to do an afterlife episode where some of the dead characters from previous seasons are integrated, generally would love to see some more depiction of this as so much documented research shows people have near death experiences after cardiac arrest.This is one show that could do it well and explore some of the earlier character interactions again, think it would be an interesting boost particularly since they push the drama to the hilt with gun shootings, plane crashed bus deaths etc.!",Negative
What more do I really need to say.  He's a brilliant actor and I see him in anything he does.,Positive
"My husband and I really like this tv series.  It reminds me of Fallout and something else...maybe Eureka.  The characters are interesting and plot the twists and turns keep you quite interested.  It's a pretty human show for being a mix of humans and aliens.There is little background about how everyone got to this point, but I don't really find it relevant to the story line.",Positive
"Reverb starts well.  The characters and situation are interesting.  The initial scare scenes are well done.  But then there are a few contrived story plot points.  (SPOILER AHEAD) Obviously, these are done to get more people involved for the later slasher scenes. If the director had shot a few more scenes depicting how the killer descends into madness, it would have added more believability.From that point forward, the plot unravels.  From my point of view, the scenes are disconnected and thrown together.",Negative
"This pilot was well written, acted, and directed and Titus Welliver is the perfect actor to play Bosch. Of course with Michael Connelly Exec. Producing I wouldn't expect anything less. He is protecting his legacy and that's precisely why I am confident subsequent episodes will be handled every bit as well.I only resisted giving this pilot five stars because I believe that no creative endeavor is perfect.",Positive
Good acting and interesting stories. Closed captioning helps to understand the various British accents. Scenery from foreign countries makes it interesting.,Positive
Love the characters; the way it ends was traumatizing.,Positive
"For Sale By Superhero by Amazon Studios is a cute movie that shows you where Amazon is moving towards, original content.  With all the studios asking for huge sums of money to stream their content this is Amazon's answer.Why fight with studios when companies like Amazon and Netflix can put out their own content.  I enjoyed this movie, it's good family fun and I would definitely recommend it for your family to watch.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.",Positive
How can you not be addicted to this show? So many people are hooked on it!  Glad to own it.,Positive
"The gang is still here (sort of) and the cases are stranger; danger is heightened, but there is nothing that cannot be overcome with LOVE. But, oh the consequences!!!",Positive
"...but it doesn't matter. This was well focused, well written and pretty well cast. Also I really appreciate the tone, mood and pace of the show. No super heroes or villains, no lame duck characters or super sleuths...just tight focus on an interesting character, his conflicts and those that surround him.I'll watch more of this for sure, and recommend all around.",Positive
Like the series,Positive
I look forward to every show.  Seeing Watson catch the few thing that Holmes misses is really fascinating to watch.,Positive
This program that I have been watching since I discovered Swamp People's first season here on Amazon is rivetingly entertaining.  I did not think reality TV could be anything like this.  Well done!  I'm happy to rate this 5 stars!,Positive
"I see a lot of people complaining about the partying, drugs, etc.  Those scenes packed a lot of character development into them and I think that is important for a pilot.  Add to that some seasoned actors/actresses and you've got the makings of a good show.  I'd like to see where this story takes the characters.",Positive
"Have only watched a few episodes, but very good.  Historical detail  is good, gives a pretty good insight into the times, political and social.  Colorful, and it makes history fun to watch.",Positive
"Aside from the stoner asian who is epically funny (""Donuts"" LMAO!!), (and maybe the Rachel from Glee knock off, who is cute), this show and the cast is TERRIBLE. So sorry Bebe, but what were you thinking with that voice? There's no way you could sustain that for an entire season...she must know this is not going anywhere, LOL.Had to really struggle to get through the entire show, was turned off right from the beginning and only stuck in there because the asian girl showed up just as I was about to click it off.Good bye, do not make more episodes. Winnowing week should take them all!",Negative
"Walt Longmire is a little grizzled, he's more lumbering than lithe, and his sense of humor is dry and a little dark.  He's sheriff of Absaroka County, in the high country of Wyoming, an old school lawman who doesn't have a cell phone and enjoys the occasional pinch of snuff -- and he's harboring a deep, dark secret.Recently widowed, Longmire runs a department that includes Vic Moretti, street smart city girl who is doing time in the boonies because her husband's job (and her own deep dark secret) brought them there -- and she's not exactly happy about it. She's a big athletic blonde who sees the bruises on Longmire's soul and tries to protect him. Vic may have more than just a casual interest in her boss...but lets face it, he's a widower, he's gorgeous, he's still mourning for his wife, there's something mysterious about him (that dark secret). No woman with one red blood cell could resist. Bailey Chase, a hunky young deputy,  thinks he knows more than Longmire and he's after his job. Chase is the occasional lover of Longmile's troubled daughter, has a rich daddy and the financial backing of some smart casino money. He's arrogant and inexperienced, but he's not the villain of the piece. Chase has a grudging admiration for Longmire and, while he may come close, he doesn't cut corners when it comes to ethics.A Martinez is always good to watch and he's at his best here as the local Cheyenne tycoon with a finger in every pie.  And then there is Henry, Longmire's best friend. Henry Standing Bear is beautifully played by Lou Diamond Philips. Henry runs the local dive bar and is a link between the Sheriff's office and the local Cheyenne community.Tribal politics and local politics butt heads, murders happen, the mysteries are always interesting, Longmire is complex and likable, and the rest of the cast holds its own admirably.  Those deep dark secrets are hinted at and remain tantalizingly mysterious and (as of midway through Season 2) unresolved. The location plays a big part in almost ever episode. All that rugged hill country, endless plains as far as the eye can see, deep forests. It's a visual love letter to Wyoming...except that it's not.  The show is filmed in Las Vegas...the Las Vegas that's in New Mexico, that is.And while we're spilling the beans, Robert Taylor, who plays Longmire, comes across as the perfect ideal of the Western Male, with those faded denim eyes, the broad shoulders and that slow way of talking. But he's about as American as an emu. The actor comes from Down Under.The television show is based on the Walt Longmire mystery novels by Craig Johnson. My curiousity is piqued and I may take a look at them. Most detective novels and detective shows don't interest me, but Longmire has me hooked.  Not the greatest thing to grace the small screen, but solid entertainment that is well done on every level. Each episode of Season 1 maintained a high standard and so far the new batch is just as good. I just finished episode 3 of Season 2 and in addition to getting another piece of the Longmire Dark Secret Puzzle, I watched a well-written mystery unfold, saw some additional character development, and learned a little bit about hemlock, elderberries, Basque traditions and Guernica. Not bad for a TV show.  Longmire deserves all five stars.",Positive
"The Office is a great show, one I'll watch into season 32 if still airing.  This season was very funny, with some great stories, and some of my favorite episodes, but saw a show that is losing its focus.  For instance (spoilers) the introduction of Holly was great, she worked well and the show and was a great foil for Michael, funny, dorky, and very likable.  But after only a few episodes she's gone.  Similarly, we get the Andy/Dwight/Angela love triangle come to a hilarious peak, but without any real consequences or fallout.  The story just ends without a whole lot of mention.  Then we get one of my favorite story lines, the Michael Scott Paper Company, which ends as quickly as it began.  (End Spoilers)  I guess that was the biggest problems with season 5, lots of great ideas that aren't fully realized.  That being said the show is still very funny, and the overall melancholy of season 4 is long gone.  The show is great, and I'm hoping come season 6, the show will take these great ideas, and really run with them, rather than end them abruptly.",Positive
"Great characterization, solid story line. An excellent series. Needs to be continued. This series is thought provoking. Keep it going.",Positive
I was disappointed with Seasn 5 episode 1. Not nearly as fun or clever as previous seasons. Just not up to snuff,Negative
great show... i don't think it could get much more hilarious than this!no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!,Positive
This show has been everything and more that I expected.  I'd like to see constant updates and new information all the time.  Keep it interesting.,Positive
I like ghost/paranormal shows so I decided to see what this was about.  Its alright.  But there aren't moments like in other shows that scare me!  But still an alright show.,Negative
"The new intro is like a bad version of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer intro about being ""the chosen one."" Other than that, the new season is STELLAR. I'm afraid I'll have a heart attack with every show. It's scary, it's awesome. You love the characters: Nick! Munroe! And Hank is going to be a revelation this season. The Juliet storyline (seriously, is her name supposed to point to star-crossed lovers?) is heart-breaking because Nick is such a lovable (and kick ass) character. This season, you can see that Nick OWNS being a Grimm like he never has before. It's amazing how he can balance being this clean-cut, good guy hero and at the same time be so fierce in battle.",Positive
"Perhaps being an Army Brat and remembering the 'stories' of WWII makes this all the more poignant. To listen to these men recount their memories is to recognize the bonds formed during combat. Friendship and trust that has remained through the years and been passed on to their children and grandchildren. Their training began in Georgia and saw them through places that have been immortalized in  films . . . 'A Bridge Too Far?' Yes, Operation Market Garden was a reality for these men. Their stories  allow one to follow their path from army training,  airborne training at Ft. Benning,  Georgia,  even more training in England, their landing at Normandy, and finally 'back home.' These men should be listened to for they have so much to share. The narrative is well done, includes interviews and photographs. Listen, if you will, and remember!7 January 2014: Now that I've viewed other Tim Gray Amazon instant videos, I decided to view this one again. The members of 'Easy Company' certainly had a great deal to contribute to the understanding of other WWII serieses. A venture into the past with this 'Band of Brothers!'",Positive
It has it's moments.  Worth the watch. Good casting and for the most part good acting. I enjoyed it a lot.,Positive
"When it comes to a guy with a good heart I think this is one of them. They both yell and scream and shout out names during the hunt but in the end they try to help that person out and give them hope and sometimes even bring them a new beginning with god perhaps. I don't know but it just seems they have an awful lot of love and kindness in them to deal with these kinds of people all day long. I mean out of 100 people 95 of them forgot their court date and that's a lie in itself. No one forgets that, but dog and Beth still listen to the same junk and are still kind to these people. I wish I could be that loving to people that cause this society so many problems and so much money. Love the show as always but maybe dog and Beth haven't done such a good job of raising their kids it seems to me as so many are disrespectful and have issues with the law as well. They're good at show business though if that means anything and good people.",Positive
"This is a very good season, but I think things are slowing down a bit. They have done a better job in the past.",Positive
"I like SciFi, a lot. It promotes forward thinking IMO.This series started out with a cool idea, of ""what if"".With Stephen King as the writer, and Steven Spielberg as the director, WOW, I was excited.Ouch. Ouch.  Arggh! This show is SO bad.If Steven Spielberg is REALLY directing this- he should be arrested, and then sent home with a monitoring device. Or, he should see his doctor to find out what is wrong with him.*No, I'm no wannabe writer- I'm a ticked off viewer!How the heck do these two entertainment giants, let such a BAD show air, with their names?There, will no longer be any... Oh, if Spielberg is directing ""I've got to see it"" in our family. Or, ""If Stephen King wrote it"", I should order it.  NOPE.For US. This is a TOTAL Sell-out from both of you. You should be ashamed that your names are on this GARBAGE.I feel sorry for the actors as well. Poor things, having to try to make this garbage watchable.Shame on both of you.Ok. I'm done.",Negative
Great cartoon one the best cartoons CN has made or produced in a long time if you love cartoons I recommend this one very strongly,Positive
Great idea to try bringing a very real subject to the screen.  However my house can not watch it because of all the nudity and the language.  If this is the type smut someone wants to watch then they should just subscribe to HBO.  Shame on Amazon on taking a subject like this and turning it into such a filthy environment that it can not be watched in mixed company with teenagers.  Or shame on anyone who thinks this show is appropriate for their family and their teenagers.  Clean it up Amazon and then perhaps it would be ok.,Negative
"CW's hit superhero series ARROW succeeds largely based on one impressive aspect: the powerful performance of it's lead player, Stephen Amell, as playboy-turned-vigilante Oliver Queen.Stephen Amell has gravitas, good looks, and charisma, and on top of that, is a phenomenal actor. He perfectly portrays the hardened and edgy human weapon that came off that Pacific island a changed man from the naive playboy who set foot on it. His scenes as Green Arrow are the highlight of the film: usually stylized, cinematic action scenes where various henchman get shot in varyingly badass ways. I'm not calling Amell the next Christian Bale, though both nail brutal fighting tactics, costumes, and masks like pros. I *am* saying he is an incredible actor that really takes the material a step up from what he's given and keeps the audience quietly riveted to the screen.But let me just say that I thought that Queen's wisecracking friend was incredibly annoying, and Laurel was both terribly miscast and extremely cliched (the super-hot law official's daughter who is also really smart and has conflicted love interests). Also, the dialogue was slightly hammy at times, and some acting whiffed of cheese. CW needs to make the show darker and gritter - more edgy and up the stakes with the villains. More gritty Gotham, less shining Metropolis.But I'm not complaining.I love the fast-paced plots and mood, and anytime we: A. See Oliver training in some illogical but awesome way. B. See Green Arrow take out dudes with a bow. - well, let me just say it's incredibly entertaining. ARROW breaks the Curse of Superhero TV Series, and has opened the gateway to other shows such as Marvel's Agent's of S.H.I.E.L.D., an upcoming Flash series, a Lieutenant Gordon prequel, and a John Constantine series (still in the works).I expect to be sticking around with this show for some time in the future! The sharp characters and excellent acting from Stephen Amell make Arrow a suspenseful, cinematic, and action-packed crowd pleaser! Arrow has hit the bullseye! 4+ stars!",Positive
"The show is funny, interesting and full of new things you don't see elsewhere. We learn mandarin words and she talks about china or things from that culture. The characters are interesting and the story is too. We have one of the books to any my daughter has me read it over and over.",Positive
"""Rome"" is almost like two different productions smashed together. One of them is a classic well-acted account of the politics and history of Rome in the days of Ceaser. The other production involves ""history of the common people"" and enough graphic sex 'n violence to get a mass audience to watch it. The first production would get five stars from me but the other would get one star. So in the end, it gets three.At the top of the production, there is an excellent cast playing out the classical story of Julius Ceaser from the point where he decided to return from Gaul to his assasination in the senate. The portrayal of Ceaser is incredible. Its really able to get across the concern about what Ceaser's intentions really are and how he is using everyone around him. The other characters in the civil war are equally well done. Pompey is rightfully portrayed as Ceaser's equal rather than a fool or a loser. The personalities of Mark Anthony and a very young Octavian perfectly set up the inevitability of what is to come. The only character whose portrayal fails is Brutus. Rather than an idealistic leading man of Rome, Brutus is written as an immature fool. The writers were obsessed with making Brutus the scorned illegitimate child of Ceaser and explaining everything about the historical character from that point of view. It doesn't work at least for me.Attached to the production is a modernistic ""everyman"" history in the form of two soldiers. They are supposed to weave into the plot to show the lives of everyday romans. But for me, it doesn't really work. They are inserted into key events in every episode in really clumsey ways. Having one of them trigger the civil war and then later be the actual father of Ceasar's child by Cleopatra is just silly. There is also an adultery plot that runs the entire season that just isn't very interesting. It would have been better to ditch the two everyman and bring in character actors for single episodes to play the roles that common people might play in the plot. Both actors are excellent though. They are actually playing far above the material they are being given.Nobody can deny that violence was a part of Roman life. Where the production gets it wrong however is when it does ""look at me"" sorts of sex and violence that don't in any real way advance the plot and are just there to draw in a certain kind of audience.The accurancy of its portrayal of ordinary Roman life is up for question anyway. The reason most productions on rome focus on the top layer of society is that we have books from the period written about those people. We don't have much as far as accounts of common rome go and all too often, archelogy combined with imagination gets substituted for solid history. And all too often, the view of sexuality in roman society is based on a couple writers who wrote tabloid style scandal material either for the political opponents of the elite or for the people in every age who consume such things.Properly edited down, ""Rome"" would be a first-class production. As it is, like most of the material funded by HBO its flawed by an attempt to draw in a bigger audience through salting in lots of sex 'n violence.",Negative
The stop motion and animation is really beautiful but the story wasn't as intriguing or as compelling as some of the other shows up here. I was not drawn to a particular character and only the visuals kept me interested.,Negative
So many good things in Season 2 as in Season 1.  Great writing and relevant to our times.  Superb acting.  Suspenseful.  Clare Danes is perfect for the part and ably supported by the rest of the cast.  All good things come to an end so I am enjoying it while it's here.,Positive
"After watching Season 1, I have become addicted to this show. I keep wanting more and I hope it makes it to another Season.",Positive
Interesting look into history of Norsemen and their desire to explore and survive !Good historical story line . Series worth watching !,Positive
"Finally, a family friendly comedy that is both funny and original. Eddie Murphy, an ambitious financial investor, comes to believe his daughter's blanket can give him sound financial advice! Meanwhile, his competitor, Thomas Haden, uses Native American mysticism and animal aphorisms to woo clients. Add to this the adorable Yara Shahidi, who plays Murphy's daughter, andImagine Thatmakes for the first truly enjoyable comedy I've seen in years. The ending got a bit cliche, but at least it was done with style (Eddie Murphy's final wardrobe is quite fashionable!). In fact, I'd go so far to say that this movie has quite a bit of imagination.",Positive
"I have been a long time fan of the &#34;Rugrats&#34; and I guess I will always will be.  Tommy is my favor, he is like the Baby Boss. It is just clean, fun, entertainment cartoon baby style.  But, Please do not take my words, watch just one time and you will see these Babies rocks.  Enjoy a quiet evening at home and watch &#34;Rugrats&#34;, I think you will enjoy it.  God Bless You. Sincerely yours; Georgia",Positive
I simply cannot say enough good things about this program.  Exciting.  Riveting.  Great characters and an interesting plot with each episode.  One of my all time favorites.,Positive
I like it. I'm not sure why though. It's a really sick show. Maybe that's what makes it fun. I wonder if it's going to last though.,Positive
"Love this movie, lots of fun and different...I recommend it highly...and watch it often! Hope you do too! bye bye",Positive
"My wife and I have sat here and watched every possible episode! We can not believe it! After all, we are of the age of the original Teen Wolf and Teen Wolf 2 movies!Who cares....great show...just don't tell our kids!",Positive
"In case you aren't familiar with the show, this is the final season DVD set.It's a TV show that lasted 10 seasons and gave the viewers a realistic world of science fiction that often made you think if it's really fiction.Imagine finding an ancient artifact that allows you to travel light years away to another planet and explore the unknown. What you discover is fascinating, exciting and dangerous; We are not alone and we are not as advanced species as we once thought.I've been a Stargate SG-1 fan since the beginning.This DVD will complete my collection as I already seen all the episodes.  This is for my personal archive of what I consider the best Science Fiction show.I have been a long time fan of Science Fiction.  I watched various Star Trek Series, Space 1999, The Avengers, Doctor Who, just to name very few.I loved them all for what they gave me; a momentary escapism.  They all have given me a place where I can immerse myself and enjoy the wonder of another place and time.Then came the Stargate SG-1.  I'm sure many will argue what is the most influential SciFi of all times.  But if you ask me what show gave me the most satisfying and lasting impression as the best SciFi, it's Stargate SG-1.I have to thank the writers and the chemistry of actors who made it the most enjoyable show.",Positive
"They definitely keep it interesting, he's seems to be the new Dirty Harry. Boyd Crowder never ceases to impress. Like it.",Positive
"The movie was half done before I ever saw one of the &#34;creatures&#34; they'd referred to only about twice by then.  Very boring.  The ending left me wondering, what was the point of the whole movie.  I didn't get it at all.",Negative
I loved it!!!  Superb acting along with a great movie.  I recommend it to all Richard Gere Fans as well as fans of thriller movies.,Positive
"No heroes here, everybody has issues to deal with along with their job.  Gritty, sometimes gut wrenching, dark, and wet, just like the Pacific Northwest.  Don't watch this one if you are looking for a feel good ending.",Positive
"Good show, good plots, good characters.  But the main character voice is killing me; hard to understand the gravelly nature of it.",Negative
"I'm not the first to mention that SGU looks a lot like Battlestar Gallactica with a stargate. The sets and lighting are dark. Characters are in conflict much like BG. A lone spaceship is up against long odds, surviving on its own without friends ... check.Yet the writers have done a good job of creating a compelling story arc with believable and interesting characters. There is a nice variety of stand alone adventure to go with the continuing plot, and the problems faced are entertaining. Throw in a touch of Gilligan's Island as the voyagers occasionally have ephemeral prospects of rescue dangled before them, and the show has borrowed from just about every popular sci-fi/marooned cast series you might be able to name. Despite this, I find almost every episode to be an interesting watch ... unlike Santuary, which teeters precipitously between fascinating and boringly tedious (and is still in production anyway).SGU may signal the end of the very long running Stargate franchise. That's a shame. I've enjoyed it since the first episode of Stargate, which in a change from the normal circumstance was so much better than the movie it wasn't even close. I'll miss it, as I miss new Star Trek.However, this first season doesn't have to worry about cancellation. It built a premise and built it well. Its a good rendition of the desert island theme, with the marooned crew making do with what they have, discovering what their tools can do, and developing new ways to find supplies and survive. However, I'd look to watch the reruns on cable before I plopped down the cash for the DVDs.",Positive
I liked this series. Continued watching on tv until it ended again. One thing about watching on the Kindle is that their are no commercials and you can watch as many episodes as you want at one time.,Positive
"Much of what you see here is known to the mainstream scientific world whichderives most if not all their funding from governments, which are trying to keepthis &#34;alien encounters&#34; thing quiet, hence mainstream science tows the government line.",Positive
"I have really enjoyed this season of Bones, Love how Bone's character is growing since she has become a mom and her relationship with Booth has grown and changed can't wait to see what else they are going to do.",Positive
"Some spoilers......This show remains as dark, gripping, and challenging as ever.  The Cylon rebels break away from the others, while the humans still struggle with the fact that any one of them could be revealed to be a Cylon--at any time.  The cast gives powerful performances all around, and the revelation to Adama by a certain person was wrenching to watch.  Olmos showed the anguish and shock that any one of us would feel upon learning that a trusted confidante was never a human at all.Richard Hatch, from the original series, is great with his delivery and timing.  He should be given more employment.  James Callis as Baltar leads us into uncharted territory as he becomes a religious cult leader, while Mary McDonnell shows how hard it is to maintain grace and hope while battling cancer.Then they get where they wanted to go, and....oh, I can't tell you, but of course they had to leave us hanging there!",Positive
my favorite show.  I am way to addicted to it. cant wait till Monday morning to get the next episode on my kindle fire.,Positive
"I see Copper as a no holds barred, gritty English action hit.  The main character anchors the cast well. Good work by all involved.",Positive
"Being Human Season 1 is an odd show.  Developing the characters are difficult because the whole basis for the storyline is so unusual.  A werewolf who ran away from home after being turned into one, a Vampire turned during the Revolutionary war, and a Ghost as main characters who through the &#34;wisdom&#34; of the aged vampire decide to try and live together and help each other to live as close to a normal human existence as possible.  Vamps and werewolves are natural enemies making it odd, the Ghost a bit clueless yet they somehow bond as friends even though they don't really do a lot to help each other out in dealing with their own form of difficulties in being a monster trying to be more human.  Somehow the writing is good enough that it held my interest enough to watch it.  There are some interesting twists introduced in the stories that you really would never think of unless thinking of this in  a comical situation, but it isn't a comedy.  I'm not really sure what it is, but season one fumbles through each of them living together frequently enough to at least become a support system to each other in their attempts to be human when not.  In doing so it develops enough that it held my interest through the first two seasons.  Since SyFy only makes 13 episode seasons character development is something that has to occur as the story develops because there aren't enough episodes to give us any background and so it is written into episodes as flashbacks and fragmented memories of the past, and the present as the past intersects with the present.  I'm watching the third season now, so the show has held my attention through not with the enthusiasm of most SyFy shows I like.  But I do keep watching, there is a unique aspect to the show that no other has touched on and has its entertaining moments.  It is different, and good enough that I've watched it.  If not for being able to stream it I NEVER would have made it through the first season on TV.  But streaming you get your answers faster so shows that aren't as good deliver faster just because your watching them back to back from historical seasons.  I think that is the saving aspect of Being Human is that I'm streaming it and able to watch a season fairly quick so it holds my attention.  I doubt it will win any awards and am actually surprised it lasted 3 seasons, but as I said, it does have its moments.",Negative
This used to be hilarious. Now it is simply obnoxious. The series is no longer funny at all. This is mainly due to Danny De Vito. This is a sad development for a series that was extremely funny.,Negative
"Some of the most intricate, gripping and cerebral American TV I have ever seen. I have always preferred English drama to some of the absolute drivel on American TV and all the reality nonsense, but here was a show that had the promise of excellence, only to find out after watching the first season that it has been cancelled!! I believe the TV execs were living on another continent when they decided to can this show and I personally believe it was a very sad day for discerning viewers. Oh well back to the BBC and English drama till another gem appears.",Positive
This is one of my husband's favorite shows. There is a great jousting that goes on between Pinchot and his crew. There is also some amazing work taking place while they are doing that.,Positive
I liked the pace of this show and was really annoyed when it ended and I had no more to watch. Everything about the show was well done from the acting to the story. I really hope we get some more of this one.,Positive
"Show is a good psychological thriller.  There is an over abundance of gore.  The three leads have big shoes to fill and they do come close but both actors who played Lector prevously, in &#34;Lambs&#34; and the original&#34;Manhunter&#34; did a better job balancing the charm with the evil.",Positive
"I love, love, love this show.Sonia is amazing, and the scripts done so well. Can't wait for the next episode. One of the best things on TV,",Positive
"I love this show. the cast is great. piper is babelicious and a fine actress. I luv the actor who plays auggie, but my favorite actor/character is the mossad agent, eyal Levine. he was in the mummy movies. who knew? very well done show, same review for all 31/2 seasons.",Positive
I am watching this program and with Robin Williams - he is trying so hard to be great with bad material. All the cast works well together but get some better scripts,Negative
I thought this was one of the best shows I have seen in a while.  The cases were very interesting.,Positive
"Enjoyable in the sense you, as the viewer, can sit back and relax while watching the drivers perform their arduous tasks knowing you're not going to fall through this ice or veer off the road. Not an older persons job for sure!",Positive
"We love this show.  The characters are fascinating whether you love them or hate them, and sometimes that line gets blurred because they are so doggone interesting and funny.  Best TV since the great seasons of &#34;24&#34;, and frankly more believable.  Beware, though ... you might start funnin' around and picking up their mountain holler accents.  LOL",Positive
"A lot of thought and creativity has gone into this show. Extremely intelligently done. The tension is constant. The situations are nerve racking. The generally quality and realism is that of a higher budget movie. The brilliant writing thrusts the characters into extremely challenging situations that rip at them both physically, emotionally, and morally.This is not silly spy garbage like Covert Affairs, this goes for the throat.",Positive
"really enjoying the bronson pinchot world.  when i watch, it is a great, fun escape for me.  i watched him years ago and still cherish the sweet, kind, happy person that he is.  wow, do we need his type of fun and wonder in our world today!  thank you, mr. pinchot!",Positive
Grandkids love it.,Positive
"Great show, first season was a hit in this household. Liked the dynamic between the characters, the flushing out of their story throughout the season, and the overall plot line. Can't wait for season 2 when it becomes available on Amazon Prime.",Positive
"I enjoy the twists and turns each show leads you through. a fun way to spend the time, I love the look you get of the English society",Positive
Loved  it and bought Season 2 but slightly disappointed in the turn of events regarding the character inter-actions on Season 2.,Positive

I downloaded these videos for my two year old grandson who was in the hospital for a few days.  I allowed him to watch them on my kindle while I worked on my laptop.  Watching these took his mind off of being sick and made our stay much more tolerable.,Positive
This is a movie about the actress Linda Boreman Marchiano who starred in the classic porn film of the seventies Deep Throat. Amanda Seyfried stars as Linda who as a impressionable young woman is enticed by smooth talker Chuck Traynor who she marries. But marriage is not an escape or happiness for Linda who is forced by Traynor to star in Deep Throat a low budget porno film that turns her into a celebrity overnight and Traynor into a monster and abuses her regularly both physically and by pimping her for money. The film is about her life pre- and post Deep throat and then her eventual divorce with Traynor. Her later years and activism are highlighted but somehow the film does not manage to connect even though Seyfried and Sarsgaard try very hard.,Negative
"Have seen a lot worse, and a lot better. This is one of those SciFi Saturday Specials that falls in between; not quite a pile of crap - but a far cry from the smelliest pile that's ever been produced.What I would have appreciated was primer, something a lot more clear than what's provided to us at the beginning of the film. So that's what I'm going to do for you here. If the premise sounds ridiculous - it is. So you need to make up your mind as to watching it based on the primer itself.Ready?Okay here it is: For some unknown reason an alien enemy has decided that it needs to destroy mankind. Now, normally that would be via war or invasion. But in this case the aliens have decided to use a manufacturing plant that pumps out humans converted into zombies.These zombies are very difficult to kill, very strong, and come equipped with their own arm pike/blade/pick-axe. Their mission is to destroy humanity, and those that somehow survive their initial rabid assaults, are then pulled back to the manufacturing plant for conversion to new zombies.Got that so far?So when this first happened mankind was nearly destroyed. But with one last ditch all-or-nothing supreme effort - humanity fought back and won a stalemate by burying the manufacturing plant and sealing it off.We now jump ahead a few thousand years. The previous global destruction bought about vast changes in civilization and (importantly) most of what happened before the aliens attacked has been forgotten; mankind has rebuilt themselves to a version of the world circa 1915 - a time when we are literally reliving World War I. Trench warfare, doughboys, kaiser inspired troops, gas attacks, etc, etc. A few notable differences are that the world is run by corporations not governments and they have steam powered flying ships.Got that?Okay, so during this continuous corporate battle for resources - battle troops accidentally release the seal holding back the zombie manufacturing plant and then all hell breaks loose - literally.Again on the verge of being wiped out - a small band of heroes sets off to end the threat once and for all, led ostensibly by a monk/priest of the old order. The same ones who led the battle against the aliens the last time. They are the only remaining believers - the rest of world, especially the corporations, think they're quaint ridiculous religious nuts. But they held onto the records from the last battle and are the only ones who have the secret to ridding themselves of the zombie machine.That's your primer. Now it's on you to decide whether or not you want to watch the film.I will add this - the director seems to have borrowed much from the same team that brought about the Angelina Jolie film ""Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow"" in that much of the film is digitally created with real actors working against a green screen. But that's not a bad thing. The CGI driven scenes are surprisingly good and mostly believable.The storyline is an another thing altogether. I will say that Thomas Jane does a pretty bang-up job as the hard drinking, war weary veteran enlisted to stop the aliens.",Negative
"Every episode I watch, leaves me WAITING to see what the next episode will bring! Now that, to me, is a wonderful thing. I am NEVER disappointed by each and every one of the episodes I have watched thus far, and I know future episodes will draw me in just as much!!",Positive
"Want to sit glued to your chair, watching episode after episode?  Then Season 3 is for you!After a friend recommended Justified, I watched / enjoyed Season 1 - right after it came out on DVD.  So, I started to watch this season, thinking I would just see what I remembered.  Wow - it grabbed me, and I wanted to see each episode, one right after the other.",Positive
My son loves this show and it is so awesome to have it at my fingertips. The download is clean and starts right up.,Positive
"This is a very fast-paced show with an interesting topic: can you tell if someone is lying to you? Sometimes there are minor problems with certain episodes such as continuity issues (the good doctor sustained significant facial injuries in the previous show but there is no sign of all that now), and I do get a little tired of Dr. Lightman's abrupt start to just about every confrontation or even just a conversation with his daughter, but the premiss keeps me coming back, and binge watching this series is less fattening that binge eating that bowl of potato chips, plus I think maybe I've learned something about human nature. All in all, the program is well done with intelligent problem solving and high tension episodes. I do wonder why the Dr's scruffy face always looks as though he might have shaved 2 or 3 days before, no matter the time of day or night that the episode starts. I know that's the current style for &#34;manliness&#34; but I wouldn't mind if he did start a show or two clean shaven, and we could see his beard grow during long periods of time. Instead, he just looks slovenly. Can't tell if he ever showers or changes his clothes. Is that also a sign of &#34;contempt&#34;, like the wrinkling of the nose or the slight sneer on someones face?",Positive
This is a chilling premise that is only intensified by what we are learning every day about electronic snooping going on in our society today.  The characters are real and one is drawn to them.  Both my wife and I really look forward to the next episode each week.,Positive
Had a few problems with watching it but customer service did a great job working it out. Loved it.,Positive
"This would have been a fairly boring medical show, if it was filmed in average USA town with working class or middle class patients. But what makes it watchable is the fact that it is filmed in the beautiful Hamptons and all the scenery and people are opulent, super rich and pretty. But even then, the show follows a predictable formula, and since Dr. Hank Lawson was an ER doctor, now turned concierge doctor for the rich, every case he deals with is a baffling emergency case. The syndromes and symptoms the patients have are new in every episode and very uncommon and bizarre in real life. Have you ever heard of &#34;a foreign accent syndrome&#34; for instance? You will, if you watch this silly medical show.",Negative
I don't like this show. I tried it but not worth my time. I know a lot of people love it but its jaunt not my thing.,Negative
Do enjoy Poirot - we watch them often.  Only problem is in that some of them. the video freezes - then a complicated process of returning to the particular video.  Believe I have to go to th Help site for that problemWorth watching.,Positive
"Couldn't wait for this new season and rightly so, great start to the season. Watch Season 1 before watching this though or you'll miss out on so much back story.",Positive
Really enjoyed this series. One downer is that it seems to keep dragging on and on instead of new issues each season.  But still is very interesting.,Positive
Dickens at his best...good story line and well acted!!  Hard to believe the government thought debtor prisons were the way to collect debts!!  Nice sub plot with a little mystery to keep your attention.,Positive
"This is not really a review persay, I love the show cracks me up reminds me of the 80s and 90s. The James Bondish feel is very nostalgic, as well as the pre-historically correct movement that brought our country to its knees.  However, I do have to say I am not pleased about the commercials they started throwing in. I ""buy"" these episodes, as such I do NOT appreciate commercials for other shows before and after the episode. This is the first series in the history of my video library (which is fairly extensive) in which they have added commercials to my videos.  Please consider this feedback and I hope that I am not alone in my voicing dissatisfaction.Thanks for listening whoever it concerns.",Negative
We really enjoyed watching this with the family. It ended too quickly and we are waiting for next seasoN! My son likes it even more than Last Airbender. I like it nearly as much.,Positive
"The series flew by and now we are waiting for part 2 to come out.  The ending is sad, but you knew it was going to happen sometime, I will keep you in suspense as to what though.",Positive
Although I love Teen Wolf I don't know if I like the direction it is taking. I like the Japanese angle but I do not like Stiles' storyline.,Negative
This murder mystery was well worth my time even though it was a bit depressing at times.  The characters are multidimensional and its is almost impossible to figure out who the killer might be.  There are many surprises and twists along the way.,Positive
"&#8220;This group really is all for one and one for all.&#8221; Hannah Rinaldi (Cuoco) has just been accepted into a writer&#8217;s group. The group is full of aspiring writers who are all excellent&#8230;in their own minds. Each writer is trying to make their own path to stardom and being published. When Hannah gets a break the rest of the group becomes jealous and the real personalities are shown. I have to start by saying that I thought this was very funny and I laughed a lot, on the other hand though this is not for everyone. The movie is a &#8220;mock-umentary&#8221; and is very much like Best In Show or Mighty Wind. The humor is for a select group but if you are into this type of comedy you will love this movie. Each character is funny but Dennis Farina&#8217;s Tom Clancy type character really steals the movie and this is worth watching just for him. Overall, very very funny but again, for a select group of people. If you like the Christopher Guest improv movies like Best In Show you will like this. I laughed a lot. I give this a B+.",Negative
I have watched every season!  I truly hate to see this show end!  AWESOME!  I will miss this show next season!,Positive
This was a terrible show. Didn't laugh once. Horrible characters. Stupid plot. Waste of time. And why does the constant dropping of the F-bomb strike this show's writers as funny? Natalie Zea should go back to Justified and forget this disaster ever happened.,Negative
"Looking forward to seeing more shows like this all the time on Prime!Interesting,funny, and full of excitement with drama to boot.",Positive
"I enjoyed the show for a long time, but the last two seasons have been reaaaally phoned in.  Its probably good that it will be ending soon, or so they say.",Negative
"Francis Ford Coppola returns to the Horror genre in a minor way with an unusual Gothic fairytale that will leave you TWIXT! Val Kilmer stars as washed up writer Hall Baltimore, who stumbles in to a small town's dark history while visiting on a promotional book tour. With the help of the local sheriff, Baltimore may have finally found the inspiration for his latest novel, but to what lengths is he willing to go in order to uncover the horrifying truth? Ever the stylist, Coppola tries to inject his own work with a series of surreal nightmares care of some shrouded mists and moody black and white. The heavy use of green screen and computerization frequently reminds us that we're watching a movie, however, and never quite achieves the intended effect that has been generously lifted from SIN CITY. The plot, on the other hand, is refreshingly original, and only bears a minor resemblance to John Carpenter's IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS. Coppla delivers a twisted tale of vampires and murder that has been cleverly intertwined with the works of Edgar Allan Poe, who even makes an appearance in the film (as played by Ben Chaplin). Val Kilmer puts forth a worthy performance as the failing writer, who keeps us engaged with his playful curiosity. Unfortunately, though, TWIXT suffers from the same dilemma as its lead character, and that is in finding its ending. After investing in the town and each of its many mysteries, the sudden ending feels rushed and incomplete. On the other hand, David Lynch would be very proud.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",Negative
"The best season ending ever. Much better season than Seasons 1 & 2. Though you have to watch them to understand all the small stuff between Holder & Linden. Peter Sarsgaard (Ray Seward) blew it out of the water with his performance. Hugh Dillion outstanding! And Bex Taylor-Klaus needs to be watched as a new break out star, if someone doesn't pick her up quickly they are dumb! Great Actress! Not to leave out Mireille Enos ( the only reason I watched World War Z) & Joel Kinnaman outstanding performances, without them there would be no &#34;Killing&#34;. I will watch anything they are in!",Positive
My grandkids love watching this on the Kindle.  It's wonderful to get an entire season of episodes for them to enjoy.,Positive
This show is engaging from the start. It feels a bit like Fairy Tale meets Leave it to Beaver. This is probably why the storyline seems to capture the attention of today's tween and their grandparents. It will be a hit.,Positive
great police show. the show is based on a policemen wrongfully sent to prison. Upon his release he rejoins the department. As he does his daily job he tries to find out who framed him,Positive
"Really good tv!  It is good enough to have multiple season but like all corporate owned network tv the &#34;suits&#34; don't make decisions on good television.  Just ratings and ad sales.  Good cast, fast paced, solid writing and character development.",Positive
"This is a super funny show.  I love the clips ....most of the time.  There is a big deal on this show involving puke.  A lot of puke.  After a while it wears on you so, be prepared for it.  I am a sympathetic puker so, this was a little challenging.  Other than that it's really good.  the skits are fun, the clips are classic and the host is a good looking dude who may or may not be gay.  Either way give this a test drive just ....you know...watch out for all the puke.",Positive
"Of course it isn't the episode, that hasn't aired outside of the UK until later today so Amazon isn't going to have it available. If you can't read the two items in the episode list and still bought it thinking it had the episode already then that is your own fault not Amazon's.At least wait for the episode.",Positive
When this show was first aired my children love loved it.  I even had to find the &#34;clue&#34; writing book.  Now my youngest grandson at 2 yrs is just as fascinated by the energy and colors that is shown.  He gets just as involved looking for Blue's clues as his mom did.  I would recommend this high energy positive presentation of the joy of learning and solving puzzles.,Positive
This show is entertaining but isn't the most educational. The shows can be used as a forerunner to a game of make believe. For example watch the show about space then put on card broad helmets and jump in your refrigerator box space ship...,Negative
"Okay, I thought I would give this pilot a try because I was intrigued by the Amazon Originals concept of viewer input deciding the future of the show. I really wanted to like this, but think I would vote NO on this one...it looks good, maybe suprising and interesting...but just because a creepy thing shows up in the final 20 seconds does not sell me. This plot formula reminds me too much of similar shows (Under the Dome, Persons Unknown, The Event) where you get hooked with the first season and there's no follow up or ending. Don't want to fall for that again. There's a group of strangers mysteriously brought together and it turns out -- surprise -- they all share something in common, except for the one  drunk, hateful guy in the group who conveniently won't disclose whether or not he has the same thing in common. I'd say this has potential, and I'm slightly curious where it might go. I'd probably need another couple of episodes to decide for sure if I'd keep watching. I suspect it's another one of those that will leave viewers hanging when the  producers decide it's not worth a second season. Maybe would make a better 2 hour movie than a series.",Negative
What a treat to watch a totally flawed fictional character bring such &#34;every day&#34; realism to a part. I almost forgot that Perry-Jones wasn't the one with the OCD.,Positive
"Hercule is sooo funny when he says he's not French; he's just so offended. Honestly, I love this character and all of the episodes.",Positive
"I am a huge fan of several principal Marvel characters, and have spent several years collecting the animated and live action versions of characters I enjoy. I was especially interested in the Ultimate Spiderman cartoon, as it seemed like more than just another take on everyone's favorite webslinger. I can honestly say the show is entertaining -- downright laugh out loud funny at times -- and that is pretty exceptional for a cartoon! I am glad I bought the season and can say without a doubt that of all of the Spiderman series I own, this one is by far the most entertaining for me -- and my kids. They really did a good job this time!",Positive
For a first season of a show this was pretty enjoyable. In many ways we liked it better than Dance Mom's. We also felt that the winner should have actually won which demonstrates that after all the theatrics of trying to make it feel like a competition it was actually about who could dance better in the end. Worth a watch if you want to just vegetate and not think to much.,Positive
"Great acting,unusual story line for a change, well made. Enjoyed the movie, it's about life and what it can bring.",Positive
This show was very entertaining.  It is definitely not a family show because it contains a decent amount of language.  I offers a great variety of humor.,Positive
"For years, the infamous `what if?' scenario has played into the themes central to hundreds if not thousands of films, books, and television programs.  Indeed, what would ABC TV's program ""Lost"" been without more than its fair share of `what ifs'?  It's become a bit of a gimmick for motion pictures in the last decade or so, perhaps a bit overused, but BLACKTHORN takes a swing at it and gives it another play for its worth: what if Butch Cassidy never died at the end of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and, instead, lived out the remainder of his days in quiet solitude?  While that may not seem the most glamorous spin at speculative fiction - nor a foundation for the most daring Western adventure ever - BLACKTHORN ends up being a bit greater than the sum of its small parts, and that's no doubt due in large part to the inclusion of Sam Shepard in the titular role as the aging bank robber hoping for one, great legitimate score to give him enough money to return back home before he withers away.It seems the Kid and Sundance didn't die when the Mexican `federales' came for them; curiously, they were able to sneak out the back, but not without the Kid suffering a fatal gunshot wound.  Once he puts his friend in the ground, Cassidy changes his name to James Blackthorn, and he takes up residence raising prize horses in Bolivia.  As luck would have it, Blackthorn learns that his and the Kid's flame from their lawless days - Etta Place - gave birth to a young man that could've been a son or a nephew, for all he knows, and the retired train robber keeps up his correspondence with the boy.  Eventually, Blackthorn wants to see his home again before he dies, so he sells off a last round of horses to a big haul of money ... only to lose it all after the fleeing accountant-turned-thief, Eduardo Apodaca (played by Eduardo Noriega), unsuccessfully tries to rob him of his horse.  In exchange for helping Apodaca avoid capture from the posse of vigilantes fast on his trail, Blackthorn will receive half of the man's haul ... if they both can survive long enough to claim it.Therein lies the `what if' and the cruel irony at the heart of BLACKTHORN's story: the man must embrace the kind of life he long ago left behind in order to make that last big score.  Certainly, the irony doesn't stop there, as the vigilantes not only close the distance separating them but also their identities turn out to be something that not even Blackthorn could've ever suspected.  It's a startling revelation for the man who's lived a life of hard truths, and it runs parallel to the premise as laid out by the aging robber's narration: ""There are only two significant events in a man's life: when you leave home and when you go back. Everything else is just the middle.""  It seems that Butch Cassidy can never quite escape `the middle' as he so desperately wishes to do, even when that means running up against an aging Pinkerton agent (a wonderful little cameo-style role, played by Stephen Rea).  The two men are long past their prime, and, if they're not careful, Apodaca will be the death of them both.Frankly, it's the kind of role an actor has to wait a lifetime to play, and Shepard fills the cowboy boots to great effect.  He entirely looks the part - a tremendous asset as opposed to aging a much younger actor under layers of make-up - of Butch Cassidy with his leathered creases and wise eyes.  There's still a spark of wit in Cassidy as he trades verbal barbs with the noticeably younger Noriega, taunting and teasing the man whose life he's saved in exchange for half of the man's stash.As westerns go, BLACKTHORN is very solid.  It's filmed in striking locations, edited smartly, and put together in a first rate production.  All of the players - including Dominique McElligott in the all-too-briefly-seen Etta Place (she can be seen recently in AMC TV's equally entertaining oater, ""Hell on Wheels"") - hit their marks.  The writing is sharp, if not a bit too predictable toward the climax, which ties up a bit too neatly for my tastes.  Still, it's a winner that deserves to be seen by a wider audience, and no doubt western enthusiasts like myself will find plenty to celebrate here.Highly recommended.",Positive
"If you enjoy this new show staring Kevin Bacon, go for it and buy!!  Joe Carol is back and full of his surprises..  a small fee here to view and stay current, without the cost of cable!!  So say yes to watching here if you are drawn in  by what is happening this season!!",Positive

"This is an ad for the upcoming season. As an ad it does not really work for me since I see nothing new in the up coming season to make me want to pay for the next few episodes. I like the Dr but I am going to wait 6 months for it to show on Netflix. Also, charging me 99cents for three minutes has made me an angry viewer.

"Continuum is worth the hype. After discovering season one while it was still just a small Canadian show, I've been salivating for the second season. In the months since the first season ended though, Continuum has blown up in the US and while I am incredibly grateful for this--I was worried that it would somehow be affected or influenced in a negative manner given a bigger budget and larger audience.While the special effects used have been consistently top notch, the reason why this show works so well for me is not because it's scifi, but because of its emphasis on the characters. Personally, I think one of the greatest achievements of a scifi picture, is when it can let the viewer actually forget that is what they are watching. When the setting and characters are so authentic, that it's simply real. And I believe Continuum not only accomplished that in the first season, but that they are also nailing it in this season as well.Part of the larger budget has gone into better production quality, and it makes it visually an even more pleasure than watching the first. All the characters are back in a big way, and the storylines being set up are delicious. Enough cannot be said about Rachel Nichols acting. She is capable of both intense vulnerability as well as total and complete world domination. Very few actresses in Hollywood could even begin to attempt to pull Kiera off, but Nichols is simply captivating. The actor playing Kellog is also somewhat of a revelation. I know you're supposed to hope for Kiera to either make it back to her own time to be with her husband or end up with Carlos, but Kellog is just awesome. However, the relationship between Kiera and Alec is what really drives the show for me though, and season two succeeds in building off of the foundation in season one as well as greatly raising the stakes.Continuum is hands down one of the best tv shows currently on air. It has the plot, setting, characters, dialogue etc etc. Not to mention it also raises some very interesting ethical issues regarding big business versus governments with direct correlations to our current world (for anyone looking for some deeper content in their entertainment).  I honestly think most people would enjoy it as well. It transcends its genre by focusing on telling a freaking good story-----and who doesn't like an awesome story?***Just a heads up, for those of you who love Continuum and are looking for more in the same vein, I would check out this British spy thriller, Hunted (Mort). It's not sci-fi, but I found it had similar sensibilities, albeit a more serious tone--and personally loved it.",Positive
"I did not realize that Matt Bomer could also sing and dance.  We've only seen him play a reformed con man on the tv series White Collar.  Even more surprising, he is actually quite good at both.  He plays the big brother of Kurt's boyfriend.  He is even quite funny as he gives an acting class that focuses entirely on pushing yourself ahead in Hollywood.On the disappointing side though is the underwhelming handling of Quinn's injuries after a car wreck which should have been fatal.  I was wondering if she could even be still alive after the horrific nature of the crash. The writer's understanding of injuries from this kind of crash are truly fantasy land.Sue's pregnancy progresses and also some of the problems of a middle aged pregnancy.",Positive

There are a couple of tv shows with music successfully included in a drama and/or comedy show.  It always seemed to me they go downhill when the singing stops.  This pilot goes downhill from the opening song and either stays there or goes further down.  The songs and singing were mediocre.  The acting and writing was amateurish.  I am embarrassed for Bebe Neurwirth.  She deserves better but should also have known better than to allow herself to be dragged into this muck.  Perhaps out of work older actors have to take jobs beneath their skill level just like a lot of other workers in this economy. Sad.,Negative
Kind of an interesting documentary. It took me a while to believe that it's a true story. It's hard to believe that any family like the Whites would allow themselves to be filmed. But maybe it's more like reality TV.,Negative
"Sort of in the spirit of ""Green Acres"" and ""Carter Country"" with halfway serious topics thrown in.  The main character (and the actress herself) seem to be that rapidly disappearing combination of beauty, honesty, humility, and sensitivity.  It's a huge challenge for someone of her limited acting range to carry an entire series, but somehow I still feel they picked the right girl.  It's rare to find a new tv show that doesn't glorify hostile, obsessive, sneaky behavior.",Positive

The teaming of high stakes law, Gabriel Macht, with college drop out naive genius, Patrick Adams, works very well -- with mostly feel good endings. Fun show.",Positive
"This film got off to a great start. Great scenes; great cinematogrphy; grerat acting; great direction.The the two Brits show up and do NOTHING but pick fights, try to assert themselves very obnoxiously, and be generally very irritating.  mean---it's just not believeable that you're going to be real argumentative with two Lugers pointed at your face.

"About once a year or so, I'm down for a raunchy, &#34;party&#34; comedy. Some of them are truly horrible and I feel worse for the experience. Some, though, like &#34;Neighbors&#34;, actually have enough thought put into them to be a fun outing.For a basic summary, this movie tells the story of new parents Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne). When a frat house gang led by Teddy (Zac Efron) moves into the house next door, a chain of one-upmanship hilarity begins in the &#34;battle for the neighborhood&#34;.Simply put, what makes this movie funny is Seth Rogen. The guy plays the same character in practically every movie he's ever been in (or at least that I've seen!), yet it continues to work because it is so relatable. He's the slightly-pudgy &#34;average joe&#34; who has the perfect one-liners and sly comments that we all wish we could come up with on a daily basis! Without his unique brand of humor, this would be a &#34;lost ship&#34; of a film.Basically, if you've seen &#34;Knocked Up&#34; and enjoyed it, watch this one too and expect similar results. It's the same type of schtick, only with Rogen playing a slightly more mature version of his role in that earlier film. If you don't like crude (often extremely so) humor and hundreds of pot jokes, then stay away.&#34;Neighbors&#34; gave me some good laughs in the theater and took my mind off the everyday grind for an hour and forty minutes.

"Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction. When they released ""Pawn Stars: Volume Three,"" many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety. It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes. When they released ""American Pickers: Volume Two,"" it was the same thing. Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two. I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases. Personally, I didn't agree with the decision but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included. Anyone who read the box knew what to expect: how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Now here's a leap backwards for ""American Pickers,Volume 4.""I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside. Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package), it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting. I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information. My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base. I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!  It's not the price (which is in line with the contents), it's the lack of information that bothers me.I, however, will tell you what is inside. The 2 DVD set has eight episodes, a chronological continuation of Season Two for just shy of six hours worth of programming.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were eight episodes on the DVD box?Season Two: (1) Fairlane Fever, (2) Too Hot To Handle, (3) Trading Up, (4) The Emu Chase, (5) Keep Out!, (6) They Boldly Go, (7) The Possum Trot, and (8) California Dreamin.  There are no special features, but there are Spanish and English subtitle options.The premise, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, is that two ""pickers"" (Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz) travel the country trying to unearth hidden treasures from the various people they meet along the way. Some of the items may have historical significance.  That's the angle the History Channel uses to tie the show into its lineup. In truth, the show has similar appeal to the classic ""Antique Roadshow"" mixed with the treasure hunting gamble of ""Storage Wars"" with a dash of ""Hoarders"" thrown in for good measure. It's always intriguing to see what long forgotten gems might be lurking in someone's garage or junkyard. Along the way, the boys chat up the locals and experience a different kind of Americana.  An interesting show, but fans deserve some respect in these DVD releases.  KGHarris, 8/12.",Negative

"An adult claymated show is a good idea and this was a good shot, and an entertaining view, but I would not watch this as a series.  Two goofballs in space?  I'd prefer Lister and Rimmer on Red Dwarf which you can see on Amazon Prime (although I wish they would get series X on Prime soon).  Not as brilliant as Futurama, either.

Admittedly did not watch it all the way through.  What I did watch did not interest me.  Maybe it is a good movie just not to me.,Negative
"I think this is another show I could see on HBO (like Alpha House). BETAS_ is a sleeper hit! It actually plays more like a film than a traditional show. It's not LOL funny. I laughed only 3 times during the pilot, and at times I felt bored but it grows on you. It's an intelligent show with witty writing and an attractive cast; despite its slow pace, it manages to keep you engaged. The characters are all likeable, everyday folk and felt authentic to me, unlike the cast of Entourage (and similar shows). I really see a lot of potential here and would totally watch more episodes. The show's soundtrack was also nice and added to its appeal.",Positive
"This series is for those of us that love life and the predicaments that can happen and you get caught at all of the times that you wish, as an observer, would love to either rescue, hide and save the characters from what happens when you are in the wrong place at the wrong time.All of the actors are endearing and acting out their characters at an A+ level.  I have all of the Californication Series and, of course, &#34;the Hankster&#34; stays in situations that make you love him more at every turn.I happen to love David Duchovny and have since I saw the movie &#34;Return to Me.&#34;A gorgeous man, intelligent and entertains at every opportunity that comes his way.Californication is a real mind blower and the observer is caught up in all of the raunchy, sexy and loving moments that have been made and rewarded by their peers.",Positive
"To tell the truth this movie was pretty predictable and none of the characters were really very likable. The effects (mainly creature) were pretty lame and to be hones I didn't really expect much better than that. The movie did have one good point I will admit. If you're a psych major or even just interested in psychology then this movie is worth a look. This movie is an interesting picture of human behavior in a survival situation and not for the best! Other than academic interest I can't really recommend this movie, there are others out there that are much better so save your money.",Negative
We see a lot of character development here as the series stretches and the story lines are still good.  Quite  worth your hard earned cash.,Positive
"The main actor Ross Kemp seems to me a cross between Kenneth Branagh and Michael Chiklis, intense, compelling, and adorable.  The drama itself has enough hooks and ladders that I wanted to keep trying to solve the murders too.  Wish it had hidden more clues throughout.  All in all, I enjoyed both seasons.",Positive
"I liked the songs overall -- upbeat and nerdy.  Plot was decent too.Most of these Amazon Original comedy pilots were *way* more profanity-laced than I was expecting.  I know Amazon plans on doing these internet-only but feels like they couldn't even sneak in a TV14 rating if they ever went broadcast.  That's why I was pleasantly surprised by this one...until the end where they end every line of a song with the F bomb.There's an irony where Amazon's customer review system would filter out the word if I put it in to protect people's sensitivities but producing this show they go way in the other extreme.Even disregarding the lyrics, listening that last singer -- diva mix between Cruela Deville and Zsa Zsa -- was harsher to my ears than Russell Crowe trying and failing in Les Mis.I'm still pretty positive overall on this one -- other than Onion News Empire, it's the comedy I'd want to see made most.  I'd give it a few star if it weren't for the style and content of that last song.",Positive
"Very imaginative story lines, beautifully acted and gorgeous scenery. What could you ask for more? Looking forward to the next series!",Positive
I enjoyed Alpha House.  It was a great mix of comedy and politics.  There is humor all throughout the show.  I would recommend this show and I'm looking forward to Season 2.,Negative
I enjoyed this series very much. It was a welcome change from the rough and tumble series I just completed (The Commander-it was also very good). The setting and soundtrack was pleasing - I was almost transported! I loved how the lead was a bit of a grumblely-gus and everyone fawned for her approval. A welcome change having a woman in a role where she bucked norms of this genre.,Positive
Storage 24 does a pretty good job of creating tension and suspense. The effects are decidedly on the low budget side. Plays like a well done SyFy movie.,Negative
Canada seems to come up with creative and fresh dramas.  Character development was slow but sure and I can't wait for season 5.,Positive
"Season two has avoided the sophomore  jinx of other series. It operates on so many different levels. In the guise of a spy thriller it  is really a story about love, marriage, and family. You care about everyone . You know it is not going to end well for these people . In the end this series will probably break our heart, but you can't look away.  I look forward to every episode .",Positive
"I've enjoyed this unique, creative series up to Season 5 (although my interest did start to wane by Season 4) for many of the reasons already covered by the 4 and 5-star reviews.  However, this season just fell flat for me and it felt that they were grasping at straws to keep the plot alive.  I don't think I'll proceed to Season 6.  And, what's with the constant wine drinking?  I mean, I know that's what people do, but were they underwriters or something?",Negative

"Archer is a very funny show that knows what it is, crazy storylines and funny lines. The show is about Sterling Archer - the world's greatest spy and the other agents of ISIS (International Secret Intelligence Service). Archer is a suave and incredibly self-centered master spy that has to deal with global espionage and a controling and emotionally distant mother who is also his boss, Malory Archer. Archer must also must deal with his ex-girlfriend and fellow ISIS agent, Lana Kane as well enemies within the international spy world.In this season 3 Archer's nemesis, Bionic Barry, takes over the KGB, and Archer's mother has steamy affairs with both the Italian prime minister and Archer's man-crush. Packed with outrageous operations and irreverent intrigue, Season Three comes armed to the teeth with exclusive, highly classified animated extras. The show is very well written and has some great lines in it. I enjoy the show and found myself laughing out loud many times during this season's episodes. I would definitely recommend this season of Archer to others.Thank you for reading my review.",Positive

"The first session is fast pace in getting most of the characters introduced and a faint story line.  The setting is in the early 1917 or 1918.  However, the ease in which the various lifestyles are portrayed gives it a 21st century flare for &#8220;anything is alright as long as you agree with it.&#8221;  I know that it is just a story.

"I seldom review TV shows because there can be so many of hours of material to sort of sift through and contemplate.  HOWEVER, once in awhile, I either feel compelled to add my voice to the chorus of praise, or I happen to see a season in a very compressed timeframe and can articulate something resembling a coherent thought.Such was the case with Season 1 of CALIFORNICATION.  I saw the brief first season in about a one week time span, and here are my thoughts.CALIFORNICATION pretty much  hinges on the ability of David Duchovny to make an insanely unlikeable person likeable.  He plays Hank Moody, the smuggest of writers, a best seller who loathes the movie made of this work.  It is the making of this movie that brought him, his long-time lover Karen and their daughter Becca from NYC to LA.  Upon arriving in LA, Hank and Karen grew quickly apart.  Hank now lives alone and wallows in self-pity, self-loathing (which he turns on everyone around him) and enormous amounts of sex, booze and smoking.  He has an almost magical touch with women wherever he goes, and each 30 minute episode may find him bedding several different women.His only bright spots are the times he spends with his daughter Becca (a stone-faced girl of around 13 or 14 who plays rock guitar, has her father's smart and observant mouth and longs deeply for mom and dad to get back together).  Hank also spends an awful lot of very hot & fraught time with his ex, because we feel that while she has found the love of a stable and rich man who plans to marry her...she is still very much drawn to the exciting & dangerous Hank.Duchovny mostly pulls it off.  If you only know him as Fox Mulder, then his performance here is almost a revelation.  He's disgusting, foul-mouthed, and always unshaven.  I told my wife, ""it strikes me that he would smell bad.""  He's also super-smart and tosses off the most amazingly tart observations on everyone and everything around him.  Duchovny is a smart enough person himself that we actually believe he understands what his character is saying.  (Given the recent revelations about Duchovny and his deteriorating relationship with HIS family...there may be more of him in Hank than I'd like.)  Most of the time, Hank is despicable.  We laugh at his antics and at his credulity-stretching ease with picking up women (although some of the sex scenes are among the funniest parts of the show).  But we also feel the genuine love he has for Karen and Becca.  He's mostly a good father, in a casual California way...and his love for these two women in his life is obvious and believable...thus his character is redeemed to some extent.  He is a man tormented by the mess he's made of his life...but also a slave to his passions.His closest friend is his agent Charlie, played by Evan Handled (Charlotte's husband in SEX AND THE CIY).  Charlie is married to Marcy...but there relationship has tamed down and he's acting out his S&M; fantasies with his secretary Dani.You might get the idea that CALIFORNICATION is not for kids...and you'd be correct!  It is foul-mouthed, contains much explicit sex and generally depicts degenerate lifestyles.But the writing is tart, and much of the acting is first rate.  Duchovny is very good, even if you don't care for the guy he is playing very often.  He balances the role neatly.  Karen is played by Natascha McElhone (the only person in the show, it seems, who won't do nudity).  McElhone has the most ferocious cheekbones!  She does a nice job, although her character seems to be stuck at roughly the same spot all the time.  Evan Handler does well at letting his freak-flag fly and Pamela Adlon, who plays  his wife Marcy, is a revelation.  She reminds me a little bit of Suzie Essman (from CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM) but far racier.  I look forward to seeing her character's progression in Season 2.  Less successful are Madeleine Martin as Becca (I hate, really hate, to say something bad about a child performer...but Becca may actually be more annoying than Hank because her face is virtually incapable of expression, her hair is horrible and her rock vocals are unbearable) and Madeline Zima as Mia, the woman Hank sleeps with in episode one, who turns out to be the 16 year-old daughter of Karen's fianc&eacute;.  This leads to many awkward situations, as you can imagine...but Ms. Zima is unconvincing in the role.  Also disappointing is Rachel Miner's Dani, who plays Charlie's kinky secretary and only manages about 2 expressions in the entire season.Overall, I recommend the series for adults who don't mind some really rough material.  It is witty (seldom laugh-out-loud funny) and the debauchery is sometimes jaw-dropping.  Duchovny earned a Golden Globe for this role, and while he might not have been my first choice for the award, he is certainly perfectly up to this complicated role.",Positive
"I was an elected official of a small, local government. This series &#34;nails&#34; it ! That's why I hate it so much, it's too real. Not fun...very uncomfortable.",Negative
"I love this show! You know a show is good when it can make you laugh and cry all within a span of minutes. Humor for guys and gals here, really a gem!",Positive
the First 48 shows you that crimes aren't solved like that in CSI. I love how real the show is - you follow the detectives on each case from start to finish. It's dramatic and emotional. I wish they would offer all of the seasons on Prime. do not watch if you have a weak stomach!,Positive
this is one of the best series i have seen in a long time. the actors were ALL very good in this series. i would reccomend it to any adult to watch. it is spell binding.,Positive
Very funny. Extremely fun too watch. Reminds me of my daughter and her friends at dance school. I hope there will be more.,Positive
its is very unique show and very unusual family doing business a very low key way and making top notch dollars.,Positive
Interesting show.  This portrays a modern day family going back in time to the early 1900's.  Not sure if I personally would be able to survive this type of living.  The servants were basically treated like dirt and there was never a nice word said to any of them as to please and thank you--that I could not stand at all--it ticks me off today when people are rude.,Positive
"Me thinks thou dost protest to much. Less is more. Your pen is bigger than your ideas. these are all the things I would say to the the obviously talented creative team of this show. A refreshing premise, well written dialogue,  Well acted and directed. All that and high marks for production values. So, why not five stars? You pushed a little too hard, tried to tell to much, show too much. As every professional actor knows when you are given three minuets to do a monologue, don't try to fit five minuets worth of material into three. Do two really fine simple minuets and leave them wanting more. In this, the best pilot of the season, they did just that. This pilot sacrificed quality for quantity. Not that what they did wasn't good it was like great sex without a climax, to put it terms that go along with the show. I get it though, they had so many good ideas they kept them all and just cut each one into a thumbnail of it's potential. At times it feels there are at least two directors in charge doing different scenes leading to an unevenness, ironically it lacked the dynamics of a well conducted symphony. Over all I liked this story, even if it is a bit heavy handed and overt in the obligatory cliche stereotypical  sex and drug references in every scene, over kill, they needed to trust our imaginations more. Less focus on the sex and drugs may have allowed more time to develop the characters. Great acting, direction and cinematography are the saving grace here. I to, hope this gets picked up and the creative team settles down to make this live up to the potential that screams to be accomplished. So yea, I recommend watching this fledgling show, give it a chance to develop.",Negative
"Going for Juno but failing, Awkward is exactly that...AWKWARD to the extreme. Everyone thinks the main character tried to kill herself when really she just slipped in her bathroom and only nearly died of the embarrassment of having to walk around with a neck brace and an arm cast and being thought to have tried to kill herself. She's in love with a big, awful dork who she loses her virginity to in a utility closet practically before we've even figured out her name. So, far...just plain uncomfortable and kinda vulgar. Though, who could expect less than the latter from  MTV?",Negative
We've watched these over and over again using Fire TV.  My 3 year old just loves this show and can't seem to get enough!,Positive
"I was glad to see this show come back for a second season. Well written, and well acted. I hope to see more and I am enjoying the improvement on the story line as it goes as well.",Positive
It's a new take on an old story. The acting and stories are equally fantastic. I happily recommend it to all.,Positive
"Shaun the Sheep is good hearted fun with short bits between longer segments.  Disco dancing Shaun, Scottish jig dancing Shaun.",Positive
"Check out my review of Season 1.  I have to say that the story(-ies) for the characters are developing much more and it's really got me hooked, so I give it four stars without reservations.",Positive
They don't receive nearly as much initial equipment and food.  Feels much more like living a true post apoc situation.,Positive
"This was another great DVD in the Good Witch series. I mean who doesn't love the holidays and a love story to boot. On top of this you get mystery and an adventure. This is a wonderful movie with a great story and on top of this the actors do a great job at portraying their characters. This series is one that warms the heart and reinvigorates the faith you have in people. If you have never seen this movie, you should!*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*",Positive
"Basics - Bones, forensic investigator; Booth, FBI Agent, most everyone works at a place called the Jeffersonian institute, plan on murder(s), solving same and a decent amount of well played humor.On to the season review.First, I love the actors, or the portions of actors you see as people in the show.On the other hand the roles that they play can annoy the hell out of me.This season, there's turmoil as Bones and Co. wade through Pelant (Genius serial killer), held up marriage, misunderstandings.The character of Angie's jump to judgment just didn't ring true to me, and left a jarring &#34;WTF&#34; in my mind through several episodes.Pelant, the big baddie...  Boring, unbelievable (seriously inscribing fractal patterns on the ends of bones that somehow get read into a computer and cause a heat sensor in the server to blow?  To me, that jumped the shark in serious fashion.).  and to quote the character &#34;I'm wherever I need to be....&#34; (Well, something like that), he's able to have snuck in anywhere, hack anything, hook into pretty much any network that's out there, including and not limited to a kitchen alarm clock.Then there's the whole Geek sideshow mentality of the series, it's always been a part of the show and I've learned to live with it,  gross kills, jokes over decaying dead bodies.... but scenes of close ups of peeling faces off of skulls...  Nope, didn't really sign up for that either.And the penultimate one for this season, Higgins, Hodgens?  Angie's serf decides to grow an insect larva of some sort under his skin?!?  Oh yeah, that's quite appetizing.Almost stopped my subscription after that one.BUT, the plots haven't wholly sucked, the  acting isn't significantly worse than previous seasons (a lot of the characterizations are quite good and interactions entertaining).And they seem to be in process of righting the ship.  So, for now sticking with it.For me, it's reviewability of the thing, I'm un-cabled, and Bones has been one of my go-to's for watching re-runs on past seasons.This one, I've had no inclination whatsoever to go back and watch again.  Enjoyable, but enough dross in the mix to make it a one watch type event for me.",Negative
"Love the series, would recommend the 3 season to anyone. Every episode just gets better and better and wants me wanting more.",Positive
"Mike Noonan (Pierce Brosnan) a novelist with writer's block after the tragic death of his wife Jo (Annabeth Gish)  decides to get away to their summer place by a lake. He has high hopes to communicate with his wife beyond the grave and he soon starts to once he arrives. But the ghost of a dead singer, named Sara Tidwell (Anika Joni Rose) also starts to communicate with him their through an old recordplayer.He also finds himself in the middle of a custody battle between a widower, Mattie (Melissa George) and her evil father in-law Max Devore (William Schallert) when he saves Mattie's daughter from getting hit by a car. Since Max is a powerful man, he wants to bully Mike into admitting that Mattie is a bad mom and that she wasn't watching her child. In-order to help Mattie's daughter, like Jo wants him to, Mike must discover the town's dark secrets.The film is a decent adaption of the Stephen King book, but that's all director Mick Garris, is capable of, either decent adaptions, like this and the Stand or really bad ones, like Desperation. What makes Bag of Bones only decent is that it just moves along slowly with Pierce Brosnan acting pretty casual about being haunted or the other strange happenings. Melissa George acts pretty casual about the strange things going on as well. The director, takes an interesting story and manages to make it kind of dull and not even scary.I think a more talented director could have got better performances out of Brosnan and George since they aren't bad actors. Garris should only be handed King adaptions that weren't big successes. For instance, he needs to be kept away from the Dark Tower, Under the Dome, Duma Key, Insomnia, the Talisman or anything else that has potential as a movie or mini-series.",Negative
"Michael Fassbender really gets his (perfect) teeth into this role as a centurion caught in a battle with the Pictish inhabitants in the far north of what was the Roman Empire in 117AD. The real stars of the show are the Scottish countryside and what I believe to be the woods around Buckinghamshire, not far from London. You can die of hypothermia just looking at some of the shots of the Highlands. This is a gore fest of the first magnitude, like Warlords with Jet Li in terms of sheer splatter of blood and brains. Dominic West has a short but telling role in the movie and David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham are first rate. Talked about scarred old soldiers.  Great. JJ Feild does not get to do much, but what he does is important.  The female tracker Etain looks like a young Catherine Zeta-Jones, especially with the woad on.  It is not historically accurate and their Scots Gaelic dialect needs work, plus that is not likely to be what the Picts would have spoken; we have very few records of their language. But for a rolicking adventure with excellent music, scenery and a life and death struggle, there are many worse ways to spend a couple of hours. The ending had a few twists, and left me hoping for a sequel.",Positive
I've been watching Project Runway since it began and I still love it more than anything I watch.Season 11 was more fun because it was &#34;teams&#34; and so there was more interaction between designers and more communitythan ever on the long-running show.I really love Heidi and Nina and felt Zac Posen was a good change from Michael Kors.  Lots of interesting star judges too.Love to actually see the designers working and love the judging.,Positive
I haven't been hooked on a Sci-Fi show since the Star Trek DS9 and VOY went off the air but I love this series! It was great seeing Jeri Ryan and Kate Mulgrew in past seasons(looks like from previews Kate Mulgrew is coming back this season too!).. and loved seeing Brent Spiner in the season premiere! Hope this show doesn't get canceled!,Positive
"very educational for problem solving, entertaining, and thought provoking. the grandchildren love it I loved it as a child as well",Positive
"I think it was the acting that blew it for me. Jafar was the only character that stood out for me. The queen and Will were so obnoxious and unbelievable as actors. Alice was fine but still not interesting. I was excited because it was a spin off from one of my most fave tv shows ever!!! But, it really didn't live up to .... idk. If I never watched another episode and it lasted for another 2 seasons, I don't think I would be missing anything.",Negative
"The film starts out as a great psychological thriller. Cara Harding (Julianne Moore) is a psychologist like her father (Jeffrey DeMunn). She does not believe in multiple personalities. Her dad finds a case in David/Adam (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) that challenges her. She investigates the lives they claim to be, only to discover the impossible.What was unfortunate was that this film moves from a clever thriller to a less than stellar horror film. I enjoyed the mystery aspect of the film. Cara's attempts to prove Dave/Adam as a hoax, blowing up in her face, time and time again was great. Too bad they couldn't wrap it up. Still it is well worth a view.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.",Positive
"Review of the program content is another issue. I had to watch this due to spousal-pressure and it's not really something I enjoy wathcing...too much gossip and drama for people who have everything.My comment is on the streaming service by Amazon Instant Video. The audio quality of the video did not match up, meaning that the words were not in sych with the movement of the lips. No biggie if you're not watching too closely and just listening, but it is a little awkward.",Negative

"Being a  big Stephen King fan I was very excited when the Under the Dome episode came out on Amazon.  Cant wait to see where the series leads to considering this story line originally derived from an earlier unfinished novel of King's called The Cannibals. Kinda makes me wonder? I have read many of King's novels but I am glad I never made it around to this book, so I can remain in suspense on how this story will end.",Positive

"I picked this title at random because it seemed lonely and unreviewed.  As it turns out it was a pretty good find.  The basic premise is pretty simple; a new doctor arrives at an insane asylum and interviews the prisoners.  Each one relates their story in a series of creepy vignettes.From a production standpoint this is pretty much what you'd expect from the time period.  The effects aren't great, the stories are predictable yet they still manage to get under your skin.  At least in part this may be due to the music.  It's unnerving and it's LOUD compared with the dialog track.  I had to keep the remote handy.  It probably helped the creepiness factor a bit that I started the movie with the sound turned up way too loud and jumped a foot when the music immediately blared.So this is a solid choice for free; it has that much more understated quality of horror at the time.  You don't have to see every bloody detail.  Sometimes all you need is a hint, an implication.  It also has the advantage that it's reasonably kid appropriate, if your kids are used to the Twilight Zone and other similar creepy stuff.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews. If you find my review helpful please vote appropriately. If you do not, then please leave me a comment indicating what you want to know and I'll be sure to do better next time.",Positive
This show is an example of how good TV can be.  The situations and characters were all interesting.  Each episode had lots of tension.  You never knew what was coming next.  I recommend this show for anyone.,Positive

"I am really enjoying this new &#34;Super Hero&#34; type show, he doesn't have super hero strength or powers, just really trained well, kind of a cross between Batman and Robinhood.  A wealthy Socialite that gets stranded on an island for 5 years, he is helped and trained by a man who is imprisoned on the island.  After being rescued, he goes home and tries to start cleaning up the streets of his town, per a list his father has left him.  This list is of corrupt businessmen who are &#34;ruining&#34; the city.  There's a bit of romatic tension, lots of action and battle.",Positive
"It is filmed like a video camera follows a bunch of people through their ordinary lives. I kinda wanted to keep watching until &#34;smothering happened&#34; but couldn't make it past 7:16 into the episode. I am a patient person, known for my ability to wait for hours without problem. That I could wait for more that TEN MINUTES in this series... signifies disaster.  Yelch.",Negative
"Veronica Mars was not my first option if something better is on, but nonetheless it was a good production and I enjoyed it when I wanted some escape - and my favorites were not on.The abrupt ending of the series was an ""oh no!"". I knew it was coming, but I still cannot believe that the plug was pulled on this show. It had its charm and the plot was getting thick and then....and then....kapowie!!",Positive
"This was a really interesting season, with a lot of development in Bones' character, and shows a lot of growth in the relationship between Bones and Booth. Pelant is so creepy, though, as a villain, and I hope they deal fully with him soon! A lot of fun stuff this season with the interns, Angela and Hodgins!",Positive
"I was eagerly awaiting the first season of The Walking Dead as everyone was. And it looked like it was going to be one hell of a ride after the pilot episode, which was directed by Frank Darabont, a fabulous director who gave us two brilliant films, The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, both superb movies. And Darabont's directing of the first episode of season 1 is brilliant. But by episode 2 something seems to slack off a bit. It's actually still a great episode but it's missing the director of the pilot, and though it's subtle you can feel it. By the third episode things actually start to feel underproduced compared to the pilot and it feels more like a soapish sort of style, with a lot of time, too much time getting to know all the character and their lives and all that goes with it. But there simply isn't a lot of action or zombies through much of season 1 on through till the final episode, which is interesting, but I kept waiting for the magic I saw in the pilot to continue onward, it didn't  happen and I was left feeling that season 1 was an overall disapointment. Decent enough but not great. I decided to not take the plunge any further and did not watch season's 2 or 3 until just a few weeks ago when one night I decided to just give it another chance, and folks am I glad I did.Season 2 hardly resembled season 1 at all. Even when things are slow it's much more interesting, but there is a lot more action and a lot more gore and horror than season 1. The mood of season 2 is solid all the way through, and until season 3 I was left breahtless and convinced that I have never seen anything else as good about zombies. Prior to that all there was to enjoy that were truly great zombie pictures were Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead (and also the remake), and a few here and there that were worth noticing like The Horde, a French take on the zombie genre. Even the older Italian movies like 'Zombie' were good in their time, but though there have been dozens of zombie movies over the years nothing really blew my skirt up. That is until now.Season 3 of The Walking Dead in simply superb. The characters are all great, the shocks and scares are some of the best ever put on film, and the gore is absolutely the most brutal I have ever seen anywhere. It's amazing that AMC could actually get away with all the brutality they have in season's 2 and 3, so much so that I can't believe the FCC isn't nippin' at their butt's over it. If you saw season 1 and like me were not that impressed over all, hold onto to your guts, because season 3 is one hell of a ride. You won't be disapointed, I can pretty much promise you that. Hands down the best zombie story ever told. And season 3 will leave you breathless.",Positive
"This season is even better than the first.  Characters are developed, and the ending to this season is totally satisfying - but leaving us wanting even more.",Positive
"I was hesitant to watch this show. The premise . seemed goofy. However Spader was in the show so I gave it a try. I was not disappointed. At times I had to suspend belief at the ease which the baddies were killed and the goodies remained unscathed. reminded me of the Man from UNCLE ( showing my age). It is very clever writing and keeps you guessing about the costars husband. What is he up to? Also the mystery about her father. Plenty reasons to keep watching. Spader delivers his lines as only he can. I think he leads the show, it may not have worked without him. Truly an original idea. So glad it has been renewed for a 2nd season so soon. Catch it in Jan and just have fun. be entertained.  .",Positive
"I wish there were more free episodes, I really like the series and the dynamic between the actors it just seemed &#34;right&#34; from the very first season.",Positive
"I love this cast, and I love the premise.  But it needs to be sharper and more honest.  For example, the filibuster scenes aren't especially funny, and they offer up a feel-good lie about how the Senate operates -- in reality, Republicans ""filibuster"" every single thing the Democrats want to do, and (except for one effort by Rand Paul) they do it without ever giving a single speech.  The real nightmare that is Congress today should provide a ton of material for dark humor.  But if it's going to be sugar-coated, it's not worth it.",Negative
"At long last, every time I look at Season 3 in my video list I wonder, what will happen next? Will there be a season 4? I have thoroughly loved this series and just happened to find it more or less by mistake as I was looking through the new releases, and boy am I glad I did. If you're a fan you should check it out...you'll be hooked again,",Positive

"Not one to usual drool over actors , I needed a lobster bib for the cast of this sexy series. Gabriel Macht's smile is enough to melt snow and he plays the role of devil with a halo so well. His underling Patrick Adams is no slouch either but his character was getting on my nerves in season two and finally stopped toward the end of season three. Excellent acting. But my all time fav has got to be Rick Hoffman. This guy is such a great actor! He makes the show. He does an excellent job of making you hate him just in time for you to fall in love with him when your not looking. Cant wait for season four. I am hooked. I even bought the song Greenback Boogy by IMA Robot to listen to in the car. Cool tune.",Positive
"Great to see the gang again, sad to see them together in this.  I'm not sure which makes me feel worse, that I watched this or that I paid for it (okay rented).  It started well I'll give it that, but that lasted maybe 5 minutes and then let the shlock begin!  The only thing that could have made it worse would have been having Harry Hamlin show up for a cameo.",Negative
"Our kids were brought up with Sesame Street and it was the best children's educational TV program around at the time.  Our kids are grown now but still remember all the characters with fondness.  Sounds like a sacrilege, but  now there are better kids educational shows that are more focused on the educational stuff and yet hold their attention better, too.",Negative
"I had been hearing about this movie for quite some time on many of the comedy podcasts I listen to. I really liked seeing my favorite comedians all together on the same project.  Knowing that the majority of the actors are friends in real life and hang out on a regular basis showed, making the tone of the movie more fun than a lot of what gets put out.",Positive
"If you are looking for a movie to add to your movie night, try this one you will love it. I watch this on Netflix, thinking it may have been poor entertainment, I was wrong. Its  starts of with 5 hiker's in the mountains; when they hear the cry of what seem to be a young girl crying for help. Then everything spirals down hill from there, I won't spoil the movie you won't be disappointed. Although, I felt the ending could have been better ,but still a great movie.",Positive
"Well--not the best Survivor but there are plenty of entertaining elements and characters you love to hate.

Several times it froze and never managed to reload (I turned it off and then back on, then pushed ""resume""--usually to good effect).  Streaming quality issues are not restricted to this item.

"Great British mystery series, continuing in the footsteps of Inspector Morse.  Inspector Lewis is an honest, hard-working widower & Sargent Hathaway is his quiet, highly educated, yet humorous, side-kick.  The two doggedly go after the bad guys with determination & lots of legwork.  Taking place in Oxford, the setting provides an interesting assortment of characters, while the perfectly matched duo track down murderers - most of the time, with the disapproval of their boss.  Overall, an entertaining series.",Positive

"The third season of ""Heroes"" was a complete mess.  The season started off in a fairly strong manner, with the heroes targeted by the government and having to work together to escape.  However, this compelling idea was abandoned after a few episodes, with the heroes once again scattering all over the globe with separate (and uninspiring) plotlines.  What the producers and writers consistently fail to understand is that the fans of the show enjoy seeing the heroes work together, and not in the same predictable pairings (Ando & Hiro, Peter & Nathan, etc.).  By the end of the season, I really had no idea what the main plotline was and why I should care about any of it.""Heroes"" started as a fresh, clever series filled with interesting characters, and the producers showed a willingness to add new characters to help prevent things from getting stale.  Unfortunately, the producers and writers really lost the thread by the third season, stubbornly sticking with the same cast of heroes, long past their expiration date.  Particularly frustrating was their stubborn insistence on focusing on Sylar as the main villian; I enjoyed Sylar during the first two seasons but having a nearly unbeatable foe makes the rest of the cast look weak.  Instead of introducing new heroes, each week brought new alliances between the heroes that quickly dissolved before they really could be explored.  One week Noah and Sylar are working together, then they're enemies; the next week Nathan and Peter have reunited, then they're enemies; shampoo, rinse, and repeat.  Keeping up with these shifting alliances was dizzying and tiresome.  Likewise, all pretences of continuity have been abandoned in favor of ending each episode with a ""shocking"" conclusion.I'll watch at least the first few episodes of Season 4 of ""Heroes,"" as I feel a certain obligation given the time I've already invested in the series.  Also, I do still care a bit about a few of the characters, despite being jerked around by the inconsistent writing of the series.  However, I find that I can no longer recommend the series as a whole to new watchers, which is something I did prior to this season.",Negative
"Last year I promised to indulge myself in the many documentaries that were getting buzz and good ink throughout the year.  The documentary is a genre that I often unfairly ignore, and I understand that in order for me to embrace film as a whole, I need to embrace all avenues.  Just like my gradual warming to the Animated Film genre, it took me a while to fully embrace the Documentary, but once I did my love truly soared.What I found this year were a number of documentary features that tried unique ways to explore a troubled past/present, and three of them found themselves with Oscar&#8217;s stamp of approval (all of them losing to those soul singing sistas).  &#8216;The Square&#8217;, which was my favorite of Oscar&#8217;s nominees, was the most conventionally told documentary in the mix, but it explored the current political unrest in Egypt with such passion and understanding.  &#8216;The Act of Killing&#8217; was not a film that really sat well with me.  Exploring the Indonesian atrocities from a truly cinematic and artistic vantage point seemed like an inspired idea, and yet it didn&#8217;t really strike the chords I think it wanted to; at least not for me.&#8216;The Missing Picture&#8217; rests somewhere in the middle.&#8216;The Missing Picture&#8217; tells a very tragic and heartbreaking story of one man&#8217;s life in politically disastrous Cambodia.  Rithy Panh fled the country for Thailand in 1979, after experiencing terrible treatment under the Pol Pot regime.  To say that I was unaware of this slice of world history would be a complete understatement, considering that I had never heard of these atrocities in any avenue.  Sometimes I feel like Americans as a whole are so horrifically uneducated as to the ways of the world in general.  We live in a bubble of comfort and turn our ears away from all that goes on away from us.  Not everyone, obviously, but as a whole.There are so many beautifully composed ideas here with regards to Panh&#8217;s reflection on the conditions he endured, but also the guilt associated with his inability to stop it.  I really admire the honesty with which Panh broached this difficult subject.The artistic merits here are bountiful.  The use of clay figurines are not only visually inspired, but they play well into the themes of childhood innocence lost, that purity that is &#8216;missing&#8217; from the world he grew up in.  The use of archived footage spliced between these &#8216;play sets&#8217; was jarring and effective.  My only qualm here is the monotone narration that I felt lessened the impact and made the film somewhat hard to maintain focus on.  It was delivered in such a dull and apathetic way that I found it hard to really invest in, despite the weight of the film&#8217;s message.I give this a B, mostly because so many of these elements line up just right.  It&#8217;s just a shame that the delivery betrays the film&#8217;s set up and leaves me wishing that Panh had found someone with a sharper way of delivering his message, vocally.",Positive
"This show is absolutely ground breaking. I have to say that I find some of these genius children junior chef's are better than some of the chef's I have seen on the original MasterChef. The chemistry between the Judges and the children is outstanding. The children all encourage each other and that is just wonderful to see. In the first episode, the children are broken up into groups. Some make it through, and some don't in each group. These dishes from the savory, to the most complex of sweet dishes is something I have never seen. Some of these children put up Gordon Ramsay Restaurant type of food. I love how the judges always have something positive to say to the children even if they have to give constructive advice on how to improve their dishes. Joe even compared one youngster's sweet dish as a lesson for life. He said to the boy ""life does not always go your way does it?""  ""So what do you do when it doesn't?""  and the young boy said ""you find a way to fix it"".  Joe said ""right, you improvise. And that is what you have done here. Great Job!."" It was a great moment and the interaction with all of them is just heart warming as it is intense and competitive.  They are making real, restaurant quality dishes.  Make no mistake about this. This is real as it gets!  They are not making French toast in the toaster oven.They are utilizing the Masterchef kitchen and in many cases doing a better job then many adults that have come through those doors.  It is ground breaking to me because they are getting these children from ages 10 to 13 and placing them in a situation with pressure, and time limits to create these amazing dishes.  I wont go into what they made. I want everyone to see it and enjoy the surprise of how sophisticated these dishes are.  I have trouble getting my daughter to do her homework?  How on earth these youngsters can create artistic dishes like these is just beyond my comprehension. The judges all joke around, but are serious when they have to be. They make it fun even with the pressure of having to compete. And never do the judges ever say anything that is negative. It is all great stuff with some idea's to help them. I think this journey they are taking is worth watching for the whole family.  I am even hoping it might inspire my daughter to want to try something new and have the confidence to do it.  There are thousands of reasons to watch. I cant think of one not to.....I say try it, and enjoy it....You cant go wrong in just trying it. But I believe you will be hooked just as I am. This is even more fun then the original Masterchef.  They really created something unique, new, and original for television that we have never seen before. Lastly, its not the judges who you are tuning in for.  They have made the children the stars of this show. It is just brilliantly done. And just good fun. 5 stars all the way......",Positive
Foyles War is brilliant.  The characters are great.  The history is real.  Truly a realistic view of the great generation.,Positive
"I have absolutely no idea if this show is any good, but I was laughing -- hard -- throughout.  Will it get old after a while?  Will it be a guilty pleasure?  Is it actually any good?  I have no idea -- but I was laughing.",Positive
"Excellent series!  I own all available seasons and I'm watching the current season on TV.  It is engaging, funny, and entertaining all together.  I believe it is worth the money.  I look forward to owning all the seasons.",Positive
"I am a fan of comedy, so it takes me by surprise how engrossed I get in this show. Furthermore, I am a person who does not believe in revenge so how did I start this anyway?  Doesn't matter and don't care...Emily Amanda must get hers!  I am amazed at the writers even more than the actors as it just keeps twisting with great irony.Don't five five * often, but seemed worthy to me.",Positive
The quality of the video and audio are great.  I don't have cable so this is a great way to catch up on what you miss DURING the season...Not waiting for Netflix to have it on DVD.  And this season is so gritty.  It's killing me that michael and fi are apart after they got together last season. And the THINGS Michael has to do!,Positive
"First off--if no stars as a rating were available, that is what I would give this show. As some other reviewers with half a brain have noted, this is quite possibly THE WORST COP SHOW EVER. Even tho I purchased the complete first season on Amazon, the pilot episode was SO bad I couldn't watch any others. Why is it so awful? In the first 5 minutes of the show we see the 'Rookies' (everyone looking like a GAP model) drinking & partying like total idiots, having their graduation in a bar. Then we cut to their first day on the job where they spend 90% of their time with their guns drawn saying ""don't make me shoot you"". AWFUL, STUPID, HORRIBLE! This show is an insult to anyone in law enforcement and to the public they serve. Mind you I have no problem with 'pretty actors' doing soap opera/drama. But this show is like watching a bunch of adults run around 'playing' cops & robbers but with real guns instead of toys. With all the great cop shows out their (the new ""Southland"" is terrific, the ""Shield"" was awesome, Patick Swazey's last show ""The Beast"" was great), you don't need to waste your time on this poor excuse for entertainment.",Negative
"While I do like the show, it can be cheesy at times.  I do like how they end each episode, making you want to watch more, I don't like the cheesy one liners, not the awesome ones but the ones about feelings...blah blah blah my heart, not to interested in emotions I just want action.",Negative
Lots of interesting twists and turns...good plot construction and interesting characters.  Having come from the 60's during my formative years the name &#34;Liber8&#34; for the bad guys just comes across as hokey. That's the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.,Positive
"The first few seasons really shine, Dexter is a fresh storyline, with suspenseful plots, and great acting.  This show stands head & shoulders above most of what else is out there.",Positive
"This show is NOt for kids. In fact ,  the lead character is a man driven by anger and humiliation to do everything that is wrong.  He literally breaks bad in his fifties as he condemned to die from cancer.  The show is well written with a large amount of very dark comedy in it.  It's very unpoliitcally correct in a bad way , but it also does depict how nasty some people are. Meth of course is destroying whole communities , so the writers picked the most offensive drug they could for the character to fall into. After all breaking bad pot man wouldn't be that offensive would it?  The acting is great , with  emmies' won by cast members over the years. This is not a nice show , but it is dark and horribly funny.  This looks best in hd of course.  SO a blu ray would be the best way to go. or hd video.",Positive
Olyphant is just as crazy as he was in Deadwood. So many great Cameos from past actors from other series makes It more interesting.,Positive
"Really exciting, fast moving show, and Raylan is so darn good looking. Can't wait to watch each new show. Great series",Positive
love the show. wish it was still on but love being able to watch anytime I want too love it,Positive
I loved this sooooo much that I just recently purchased it on blu-ray! I am a Gleek through and through!,Positive
"I just started watching this last night and the drama and intensity brings back memories of 24.  I was happy to see quite a few of the actors on this series that I have seen on similar dramas who do an excellent job.  My only complaint with the very first episode is the amount of time they spend on the flashbacks, sometimes to the extent that what they repeat it a second time.  Guess I'll have to wait and see how the rest pans out, but it is entertaining!",Positive
My husband and I loved this! Judi Dench is fantastic and all of the actors are superior....I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this!,Positive
"It must be an age thing. I could not get past 10 minutes of this. The charcters were unlikeable, the writing not funny. I'll pass on this one.",Negative
"I love rooting for him and the twinkle in his eyes is such a turn on. And, when he is vulnerable he melts my heart.  I have even come to like Lemon and her Dad. Great  show, I enjoy every minute of it.",Positive
"Hello, this series is quite good.  The acting is very good and better than I was expecting.  A great series to watch.  Almost like a precursor to some king of world wide apocalypse.  I like it a lot.",Positive
A story that lets you follow without complications or convoluted stories. Easy to get hooked. a different anti-hero but very entertaining.,Positive
"didnt care what the show was. i was so entertained by this actress from her days on ""rescue me"" that i pressed ""buy now"" without another bit of information other than the name of the show itself.and so far shes exactly as you want her- funny, REAL, neurotic but sharp as hell.  I will scream like a stuck pig if this show goes down hill, but when i am this happy with a pilot, things can only get better.if i dont follow this up in a few days with a rant, then give this show a shot. :)",Positive
"""Rizzoli & Isles"" returns for its fourth season on TNT with its principal cast intact and a whole new set of excellent episodes set in the Boston Police Department.  Angie Harmon is street-wise detective Jane Rizzoli; Sasha Alexander is her best friend, medical examiner Maura Isles.  Bruce McGill and Lee Thompson Young are Jane's fellow Homicide Division squad mates Vince Korsak and Barry Frost.  Lorraine Bracco is Jane's mother Angela.When we last saw them at the end of Season Three, Jane and Maura were leading the rescue effort to get Jane's brother Tommy, his baby son TJ, and Detective Frost out of a collapsed parking garage.  In the new season, the crew deals with the aftermath of that traumatic incident.  Jane's injured soldier boyfriend will elect risky spinal surgery; Maura will struggle to build a relationship with her newly discovered mother and step-sister.  The trial of Maura's mobster father Paddy Doyle will hang over the season, placing strains on Jane and Maura.  Jane's brother Frankie finally gets his detective shield, putting him at odds with Jane at more crime scenes.The episodes combine tense police procedural with moving and sometime hilarious family drama.  Jane and Maura will have difficult cases to solve, including one in which Maura is framed for murder and another in which Jane has to work with an old boyfriend she no longer trusts.  The christening of Tommy's TJ turns into a social disaster, with TJ's mother threatening to take the child out of state and away from Jane's family.  The end result will be superb entertainment.  The heart of the show continues to be the wonderful friendship between Jane and Maura.  Recommended.  And Rizzoli & Isles has already been renewed for Season Five.",Positive
"If you liked seasons one, two or three, you will like this one.  Fun ,a little corny at times, sci-fi show.  Similar entertainment to eureka with a little more unexplained items.",Positive
"This will probably be one of Billy Bob Thornton's final films as he has stated publicly that he is pretty much done with making films at this time in his life. I'm sorry to see him retire, but he certainly has left us with a wonderful legacy of films that are &#34;a little different&#34; than the usual fare. This is one of those films.There's a lot of violence in this film, right from the start, but it isn't gratuitous violence. The seemingly obvious plot soon reveals some very unexpected twists and surprises, which is great fun. Thornton isn't one of the main characters, but he is certainly unforgettable as a murderous, power-hungry tycoon who has diverse groups of thugs at his beck and call.The real stars of the film are the seemingly rotten-to-the-core brothers who will do anything for money. They set out to do a high-paying job for Thornton, but they are transformed when they learn the job is the kidnapping of a young man who has severe mental and physical disabilities. This transformation is great to watch. Don't get me wrong, the movie doesn't turn mushy as the carnage keeps things rolling at the pace of a roller coaster.The acting is excellent, as is the script. I saw this without having any idea what it was about, just looking for another good Thornton film ... and I definitely found one here. I ended up buying it as well.",Positive
Great comedy just love it. Been a long time since I enjoyed Tv usually watch movies,Positive
I loved Alpha House. I would become a Prime member to watch a whole season. The acting was great. John Goodman knows how to deliver his lines.,Positive
"The show managed to be apolitical for the first half dozen installments, but two militia psychos were introduced and the only explanation we get for their murderous and evil vocation is &#34;we are Constitutionalists&#34;. Oh I feel so shunned and associated with psycho-murderers because I know what is in the Constitution and that most of modern government violates it. If you are not going to discuss something seriously then don't bring it up. Just using your show for some not-so-clever name calling is not impressive it is pathetic and indicates an intellectual and honesty deficit.",Negative
"I know they had plans for a Season 6, so the show doesn't wrap up as neatly as it could have and I still have a place in my heart for Stargate, even if this isn't SG-1, but overall this season was disappointing. It had it's moments and I love the sci-fi and imagined history, but I just couldn't get into it anymore. Watch it for free, but I don't think there is a need to spend your money on this.",Negative
My wife and I have spent hours watching. The chemistry is great between all the characters especially Geoffrey Palmer and Judi Dench.,Positive
Thought provoking. Well acted movie. I love the unusual relationship these characters had. Very interesting story. It was touching how much the postcards meant to each of them.,Positive
This season we have once again dug up previous players only this time they threw in a family member as well.  The two worst decisions ever made by the producers of Survivor were when they brought back Jon Dalton in Survivor: Micronesia and if you watch the show you know how that went... and this season they brought back Colton Cumbie.  Really?  Well that went south quickly enough we weren't subjected to his whining for long.  So far I am not impressed with this season.,Negative
This is a very well written script with a great story line and would love to see where it goes given a chance.,Positive
What's not to like. This must have been written on one of her vacations because it is entertaining but involves more dialogue than one may like. Usually she has a large cast of characters but these episodes seem to skate by with a lot of chit chat. Good for a rainy night.,Positive
"Rather psychotic story of a car tire becoming a destructive force and sharing this out-of-this-world ability with other rubber rubbish around.It is hard to catch a meaning of this delusive tale if even on fashionable save-the-planet merit.Nice music, good cinematographic skills-nothing to watch and remember afterwards but an brain-rich tire.",Negative
"Season 2 is essential viewing if you enjoyed season 1 or even if you came to the series late like I did and wanted to start from the beginning to fill in the character back stories.  However, there are some flaws that make it less impressive than the seasons 1, 3, 4, and 5:1. While season 2 has some great moments (particularly for Ben, John, Lydia, Sammy, and Nate), it is clear that the writers probably planned to spread the story arcs out over more episodes than 6.  Most of the arcs get resolved by the 6th episode, but the resolutions don't feel earned, particularly for Sal and Chickie.2. I don't like how Amazon Instant's digital version has all the curse words bleeped out.  I know this is how the show aired, but seasons 1 and 3 have all the curse words unbleeped, so why not the same treatment for season 2?  The bleeps are distracting. I'd rather have no curse words that all the bleeps.If you can put up with these minor flaws, stick through season 2, because seasons 3, 4, and 5 are excellent and will be enhanced by knowing the starting points for the characters.",Negative
"This show is totally awesome!  I love the way they show it from present day, while providing flashbacks of when Ollie was marooned on the island.  It gives backstory and reminds me of Once Upon A Time",Positive
"one of my most fav shows!  Excitement, intrigue and drama!  Can't wait for next season!  IF you haven;t seen this show, you must watch!",Positive
"If you're a fan of Adri&aacute;n Garc&iacute;a Bogliano, and you've seen either &#34;Penumbra&#34; or &#34;Cold Sweat,&#34; you will absolutely be blown away by this stylish possession feature that shows Bogliano's growth as a storyteller and highlights his signature style. &#34;Here Comes the Devil&#34; is his best film to date. It's unpredictable, shocking and wholly original. To know too much going in is to ruin the bounty of surprises that wait to be discovered. This one is a must-see.",Positive
My husband and I really enjoy watching this show. You get see all different types of weapons and witness the skill and marksmanship of those that compete.,Positive
Great show and gets better as it goes.  Arrived quickly and in great shape.  Must watch from the beginning. Amazing!,Positive
Doctor Who is great! I was not a fan at first but it sucks you in. Never thought a TV show could be so fascinating and aggravating at the same time!,Positive
"Another modern, real-life take on an X-Men style story with a little sprinkling of a cop drama.  This season was a nice setup, with a good build throughout with a season ending that sets up for an interesting start to the second season.This story line is something that could go on for years of stories.  Since any person can have alpha abilities, the pool of different interactions is almost endless.",Positive
Great characters and storylines,Positive
"Admittedly we're only 6 episodes in but sadly there's been a big drop in comedic quality since season 15. Something has gone sadly wrong this year where the normally sharp satire has been replaced with parodies of TV shopping networks, other TV shows and 'specials' that don't make any sense in the South Park universe (Cartman becoming Jewish?).I've been a huge fan of South Park for years, often wondering how they manage to maintain quality for such a long running show. But unless things improve soon, it looks like season 16 may be South Park's ""Simpsons moment"", marking the turning point where the show loses its edge. Are the best days still to come for Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman? Please prove me wrong.",Negative
"This show is well written, and they obviously have a large budget. Hope to see it for a few more seasons...Highly recommended!",Positive
"I love animation, play-doh/clay, and sci-fi.  That being said, ironically I found myself not loving this pilot.  It wasn't terrible, but the humor was flat...or maybe just the voices.  I think that even marijuana advocates might find it falling short, well minus high school kids or college freshmen with their newfound devotion to following the slogan, ""what's of the earth, is of the greatest worth."" I have much love for Kevin Sussman, and I think he deserves to have roles/parts larger than in The Big Bang Theory/Burn After Reading/Ugly Betty/Weeds/Tabletop, but I'm not sure this is it.",Negative
"I enjoyed watching Dora and Boots and  the Gang with my Granddaughter on Saturday morning.  The plot lines are simple and easy for her to understand, (she is a preschooler), and she was really engaged.  She loved being a part of the story when Dora asked her to participate.  She was so involved in what was going on.  We had a lot of fun, and we will enjoy watching it again very soon.  We love Dora!!!!",Positive
"My wife and I recently had the delight of taking a guided tour through the streets of Tombstone, Arizona.  We're both history nuts, and our guide - a retired doctor who's gone about researching the peoples and places of the famed city for his own purposes - peppered his 2 and  hour presentation with modern pop culture references in order to help bring the days of the Wild West back to life.  In terms of authenticity at depicting the struggles of daily life for common folks, he rated two television programs very high.  The first - we guessed right - was DEADWOOD; the second was a bit of a welcome surprise: AMC TV's HELL ON WHEELS.HELL ON WHEELS appeared on AMC's schedule with relatively little pomp and circumstance ... at least, little by comparison to their competing programs MAD MEN and THE WALKING DEAD, which were given red carpet treatment.  The small, comfy Western's first season came and went with little critical acclaim, though it currently garners a respectable score of 63 on Metacritic's tracking poll.  Starring a practically unheard of Anson Mount in the lead, along with strong character actor Colm Meaney in a sizable secondary role, HELL ON WHEELS is `the story' of the old West, of pioneering a frontier and making it hospitable for the men, women, and children coming to populate it, all with a healthy bit of gunslinging vengeance thrown in for good measure.Cullen Bohannen (played by Mount) harbors a mystery: he's on a personal vendetta to find and kill the men who raped and murdered his wife while he was away fighting the Civil War.  In order to `fit in' inconspicuously amongst with the unruly types populating the expanding Western frontier, he takes a job as a crew chief for Thomas Durant (Meaney), rail baron.  However, Durant's sheriff - `The Swede' (Christopher Heyerdahl) - suspects Bohannen is secretly up to no good, and he goes forever out of his way to keep the man under his thumb.  The track will be laid, blood will be spilled, and vengeance will be had ... but at what costs to the players involved?What's particularly fascinating about the program is that - strictly from a character dynamic - Bohannen never knows who to trust, and this keeps the audience on the edge of its seat.  He's an effective boss, but he's constantly on his guard against others wanting the `top job' and willing to weasel it out of him.  Durant clearly suspects Bohannen's motives, but he's beholden to him at the same time for getting the tracks laid.  Lily Bell (Dominique McElligott) - a widower with strong ties to the train business - wants to trust the man, but she's drawn into her own affairs to set right the legacy of her late husband.  To its strengths, WHEELS becomes a kinda/sorta Western noir as the roles of `ally' and `adversary' always seem to be in flux for our main character.Also, the expansion of the frontier - the building of the railroad - serves as a metaphor for all the stories here.  No gains are made without great personal effort and sacrifice.  With each new stretch of track comes another turn into unsuspected treachery - be it financial, spiritual, or even territorial as the local Indian tribes seek to stop the `black beast' rampaging over their land.  But, in order to grow, something must be torn away first - or be crushed under the locomotive's mighty steam-driven wheels - and the frontier promises to always extract its price.Bohannen's primary storyline - vengeance - comes and goes throughout the course of the first season; it plays strongly into the pilot episode, as well as significantly in the season finale, but along the way he's allowed to grow a bit and come to grips with the consequences of his actions.  Where it'll all go is a mystery as the season ends on a bit of a dramatic upheaval (no spoilers, just a massive set-up that might change the stakes for all involved) ... but I'll definitely be on board once the train heads out again for the next season.If there is any weakness to the stories here, it's the prevalence of interracial relationships.  For some reason, it seems as if the writers were intent upon putting everyone through the ropes so far as `race matters' was concerned.  Granted, you've got your `whites,' your `blacks,' and your `native Americans' all thrown together at a time when the cultural melting pot was boiling on the stove, but I'd rather the program dial back the blossoming romances every-which-way and continue to tell great stories of exploration.  Bohannen's search for justice has enough teeth to carry the main narrative for a respectable amount of time; layering on secondary romance after romance only dilutes the tales into yet another `spin' on race relations that, so far, carries the same moral of the story: ""try to get along regardless of color, folks.""  Plus, there's plenty of gibes made at the expense of the Irish.  Seriously, by the end of the season, I was hoping that the writers played out the race card so that it appears only sparingly in the episodes yet to come.  It grew tired real quick.Mount, in particular, does an impressive turn as the principle gunslinger here.  For a talent whose rarely been seen on the big and small screen, he brings a wit and a charm to his grizzled stare, and the West comes alive with the crack of his pistol.  He's an everyman plunged into an antihero's journey - a jaded past and a jaded future - every bit as mean and lean as the circumstances require of him.  Meaney feels a bit miscast, at times, but, as the season progresses, his character thankfully gets fleshed out a bit more.  The true grit here, though, goes to Heyerdahl's Swede; he chews scenery every time he's on the screen - a great foil to Mount's main thrust - and it'll be a pleasure to watch where this ticket takes him.HELL ON WHEELS is produced by a partnership of AMC with Entertainment One Television, Nomatic Pictures, (gayton)2, Endemol, Endemol Entertainment UK, and H.O.W. Productions.  DVD distribution is handled through Entertainment One.  The disc is solid with exceptional video and audio production qualities; it looks and sounds terrific.  Music is used to terrific effect throughout the first season, at times sparse and, other times, haunting.  There's a great array of special features, including several `making of' shorts and character bios as well as some additional focus providing key insight into the narrative of several episodes.  If you're looking forward to season two, then you'd do well to bone up on these in order to better grasp where the show may be headed when it comes back to the small screen.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.  Fans of HBO's late foray into the contemporary Western DEADWOOD would do well to discover HELL ON WHEELS' charm; it isn't as obviously vulgar or gritty, but it captures the mystique of that certain time and place of the days long ago with equal emphasis on delivering a quality show with exceptional (if not minimalist) production qualities.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Foundry Communications provided me with a DVD screener of HELL ON WHEELS: COMPLETE FIRST SEASON by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",Positive
"I missed the opening show broadcast because I didn't realize it came back after 3 months so I needed to download the first episode. This way I can keep up with the rest of the season. It does have more minorities than ever before and one of the sexiest females to fill up a bikini. The one hunk who filled his trunks was also pretty stupid and was gone by the end.This season includes a former NBA star of 18 years, Cliff Robinson.",Positive

"Zombie Strippers (2008) is a horror comedy that as you might guess from the title, involves a number of women working as strippers who are transformed into zombies.  Reality is pretty much off the table early, as besides taking a few shots at George W. Bush, featuring half naked women getting violent, spilling blood, and engaging in some outrageous acts, is the main point of the film.Sometime in the future, a private company working with the government has developed a Chemo-virus that re-animates the dead, and turns them into relentless fighting machines.  A soldier infected by this formula while on a mission, winds up at a strip club where he attacks a dancer named Kat (Jenna Jameson), turning Rhino gentlemen's club's star attraction into a zombie, who covered in blood, becomes an even more popular performer.Club owner Ian Essko (Robert Englund) sees his staff of strippers gradually being transformed into infected homicidal zombies who murder his clientele, however he isn't too concerned, since profits are way up.  The talent includes Gaia (Whitney Anderson), Lilith (Roxy Saint), and an innocent newbie named Jessy (Jennifer Holland), a Christian fresh off the farm, seeking to earn enough cash to pay for an operation for her grandmother.  When the zombified clientele gets loose, Essko arms his staff.  Eventually the army gets on the trail, and raids the establishment with chaotic results, as the violence reaches extreme levels, featuring outrageous gore, and some pretty radical special effects.Zombie Strippers features cartoonish violence, gory kills, lots of blood, crushed skulls, and half-naked zombies engaging in some radical dance numbers, in between infecting the club's mesmerized patrons.  The zombie makeup gets more extreme as Jenna Jameson and Whitney Anderson evolve into rival creatures who do battle on the dance stage.  Jameson's character even goes on the attack with vaginal launched projectiles.For zombie fans that are also Prime members, Dead Snow (2009), Brain Dead (2007), and Aaah! Zombies (2007) are among the current offerings that might be worth your time.",Negative
Clean and fun Sci-fi. Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe. Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil. Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi. This was probably the best season for this series.,Positive
"George and his fellow bad members pick up small gigs at night, while working at the asylum during the day. As cooks fot the criminaly insane, it is their job to prepare and serve the food for the inmates. With a less than ideal job, the group is hoping to make it big sometime soon and leave the asylum for good. Unfortunatly for them, the inmates have other ideas.As a giant thunderstorm rolls through the town, the power at the asylum goes out. The lights don't turn on, the security doors are useless and the phones are dead. Reluctant at first, the cooks decide to restore order and bring the wandering inmates back to their cells. George and his friends soon realize the inmates my be insane, but they are not stupid. With an almost methodical plan of attack, the prisoners slowly begin to take over the darkened asylum. Armed with whatever they can find, the criminaly insane hunt down the gaurds and cooks, all while inflicting some serious pain.The overall production was seemless. The cimematography is absolutely top notch as not one frame from this film is out of place. The picture perfect lighting and color tone found within this film emphasizes the detail and dedication that went into this production. The acting is seriously some of the best to come from a low budget film in a long time. Rupert Evans, the actor playing George, is the dominate acting force in the movie. His performance was is true, beleivalbe and without hesitation. Be on the look out for more from Evans.IFC Midnight comes through big time with their release of Asylum Blackout. Director Alexandre Courtes delivers the scares and the gore in new and inventive ways. The blood is plentyful and the deaths are to die for. Along with the great direction, the superb camera work and acting ensures this 2012 horror/thriller hits on all cylinders.",Positive
"Robert Taylor reminds me of Steve McQueen, who was a much better actor than he got credit for. Taylor (as Longmire) has had to hold so much back this season and still function. Remarkable character. Good stories. Lou Diamond Phillips has still got &#34;it&#34;, and this is a great part for him. Next season maybe the women can get slightly bigger stories?",Positive
"The last episode ended as Rick chops off Hershel's leg after he is bitten by a zombie. As they worked on him 5 living prisoners pop up and surprise the group. The prisoners thought they were a rescue team but soon realize that they are just civilians. There is a fierce standoff and the group puts Hershel onto a rolling cart and backs cautiously out of the cafeteria.The prisoners follow them and there is another confrontation and Rick and Darryl back them down. They try to negotiate a peaceful coexistence but it is difficult. The group and Rick have to decide which is worse, the violent prisoners or the flesh eating zombies....This episode is simply the best one of all of season 1, 2 and 3. The action and suspense is nonstop. If they can keep up this type of intensity then this season is destined to be spectacular. This TV show is directed, produced, acted, and written like a top class movie with a lot of action. I loved this episode and I recommend it to you.",Positive
"Love this show watch with my adult son, episodes go by so fast because so much is always going in the show.  Great cast.  Not just about wolves, alot of stuff going on.",Positive
"It is different from other shows in that this family is both modern and old school when it comes to their lifestyle. It is like the Beverly Hillbilly's built their mansion on their own land where they hit oil and are living out in the woods. A very unique blend of country living, family roots that go back generations with some cash and modern day society thrown into the mix to interfere with the natural order of things. Si is just a naturally funny guy and I can see why everyone in the family loves him.",Positive
"This season was good. I have watched almost every season from the beginning.I hope they keep that new investigator(not Michelle but the other one) She seemed down to earth and relaxed. She wasn't trying to show off or anything. I hope they bring her back. Michelle lied on the Acadamy. She was not a good investigator, She just seems like she doesn't want to be there. Adam however blew me away. Adam was a great choice. I love Adam and Amy. Amy has really stood out since Kris left. I love watching Adam and Amy. They make a great team. As well as Britt and KJ. We will miss Grant, Steve and Dave are always fun. But Jason needs his buddy Grant. :(",Positive
I love Zack bagans and crew.  Aaron is really gutsy.  The intelligent responses they get out of their machines gives one pause,Positive
"Forgive me for saying this, readers, but I honestly don&#8217;t find all that many modern day ghost stories really that interesting.  It isn&#8217;t as if I don&#8217;t like the tales these storywriters spin; I do, but I think that studios spend more on CGI and other special effects that truly warrants a good cinema scare.  Why?  Well, when it comes to ghosts, there&#8217;s honestly something to be said for ratcheting up the fright quotient without having to resort to such post-production trickery.  I&#8217;d rather be scared silly by what filmmakers don&#8217;t show me than I ever want to see someone&#8217;s face eaten off digitally.  If that makes me old-fashioned, then so be it &#8230; but, thankfully, every now and then a flick like HAUNT comes along to whet my appetite.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;Years ago, Dr. Janet Morello (Jacki Weaver) saw her entire family die in their house under tragic and gruesome circumstances.  Wanting a change of scenery, she sold her home to the Asher family, including teenage son Evan.  Evan is the only one suspicious about his family&#8217;s supposed new dream house, and after striking up a friendship with his troubled neighbor Samantha, he discovers a way to communicate with ghosts of the slaughtered Morello family.&#8221;There&#8217;s more &#8211; quite a bit more &#8211; but methinks you catch the drift.Unlike a handful of other releases as of late, HAUNT doesn&#8217;t rely much on special effects to weave its spell.  Instead, it presents a handful of clever characters and pits them against what appears to be a mildly haunted house, and then lets it all play out for those interested in watching.Of course, it goes without saying that ghost stories usually incorporate a handful of weaknesses while exploring its universe.  First, if you don&#8217;t believe in ghosts, then why are you even bothering with reading this review?  You&#8217;ll have to be inclined to accept them as entities-of-a-sort in order to swallow what happens here.  Second, the characters are never created deeply enough to overpower the story being told; by the time the credits are set to roll, the single greatest purpose of a ghost story is to make sure you&#8217;ve been scared &#8211; so if you&#8217;re looking for all of these folks to have been pulled from the celluloid exploits of, say, Ghandi, then you&#8217;re in the wrong place.However &#8211; because characterization or greater character development is not a strength of typical ghost stories &#8211; it&#8217;s important for screenwriters to try to keep these people in the realm of the imaginable.  Evan seems like a good kid.  Samantha?  Seems like a troubled youth.  Evan&#8217;s mom and dad?  Meh.  They take all-too-easily to the idea of their son spending the night in his brand-new room upstairs with a girl he just met; there isn&#8217;t an iota of pushback or questioning the young man (though mom does give him the obligatory &#8220;we trust you, dear&#8221; gibberish), and that just didn&#8217;t seem even remotely real to me.Along with that, writer Andrew Barrer serves up a few twists that don&#8217;t quite make perfect sense (Evan&#8217;s younger sister has no trouble communicating with ghosts in the house, but why is those same ghosts are so vicious with others?), but director Mac Carter smothers it all in a kind of dreamy, sugary cinematography that methinks they&#8217;re hoping you don&#8217;t notice these lesser blips on your radar.  At the end of the day, they want you to believe in that magical box &#8211; the one that buzzed, hummed, and crackled with electricity &#8211; and its ability to connect you with the afterlife.  Don&#8217;t ask why nobody smells the corpse obviously decomposing between the walls &#8216;cause that&#8217;s really no important right now.Also, there&#8217;s a final speech delivered by Dr. Morello herself (it&#8217;s a voiceover while audiences are treated to a visual recap of specific events now that the secret is out).  I&#8217;d like to think it served the picture well, but because it was captured and delivered through ten layers of nefariousness I thought it was a bit overkill.HAUNT (2013) is produced by QED International and Revolver Picture Company.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group under the IFC Midnight label.  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly assembled set of scares, and director Carter has gone to some pretty respectable lengths to dish out some terrific sights and sounds.  Lastly &#8211; if it&#8217;s special features you want &#8211; then you&#8217;re in for a welcome surprise: there&#8217;s a bevy (especially compared with other similar releases I&#8217;ve come across as of late) including a commentary, extensive cast interviews, a behind-the-scenes short, some interesting &#8216;Morello Case Files,&#8217; an examination of the make-up, and the theatrical trailer; that&#8217;s far more than I&#8217;ve seen from bigger budgeted pics as of late, so hats off to all involved.RECOMMENDED.  There may be very little in HAUNT that distinguishes it from older haunted house flicks, but I&#8217;d be inclined to argue that &#8211; in today&#8217;s era of relying heavily on CGI and other post-production trickery to rouse up some scares &#8211; there&#8217;s not all that much wrong with that.  You get precisely what all involved appear to have set out to deliver &#8211; a relatively bare-bones chiller that might not be as character rich or photo-friendly as some of the box office&#8217;s latest offerings but instead serves up a reasonable number of chills in under 85 minutes.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group and IFC Midnight provided me with a DVD copy of HAUNT by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",Negative
"I really like the music, concepts and the colors. The imaginative creators and producers always have a positive message to convey. I find this show to be good for 2 to 4 year olds. DJ Lance and his crew Rock.....",Positive
"This is the season that concludes the Prison story line in a massive crashing thud.  I love it.  Yes I know, Carl is annoying but Michionne is awesome.",Positive
"This is the best made television out there. No American made show or series comes close. The dialogue, the sets, the wardrobe, the lighting, locations and cinematography and characters are top of the line. The staging is staggering in the first six seasons; the quality control falls off in some episodes later on. Perhaps because you get used to an exquisite product watching the first six seasons. Agatha Christie would be proud; maybe intimidated by the way her stories have been brought to life.  Every detail is spared no expense and continuity is unmatched. I can watch these over and over in spite of the fact that I know the ending and who the villain is. If you have never see a Poirot episode it&#8217;s well worth your time to watch. John Strickland is an excellent director and Suchet, and cast is top notch. With a cinematographer like Gavin Finney  casting by Susie Parriss, production design by  Jeff Tessler  and kudos to the entire production team, they are one of the best ever assembled.",Positive
Gonna have to buy more episodesMy family and I love this show it is a great show that we all love to watch.,Positive
"I love this show!!  It is a unique and exciting way to present a police procedural.  The storytelling is fascinating and the characters are both written and acted well.  My only negative comment concerns the Juliette character.  Last season I found her to be annoying but this season she truly ticks me off.  Her character is supposed to be intelligent, but she does and says some pretty stupid things - case in point:  during her meeting with Adalind, she tells her all sorts of things about the trailer NIck's aunt left him before she died, where it is, etc.  If some woman that I barely knew showed up out of the blue and started asking me questions about my estranged boyfriend, I certainly wouldn't sit there and answer them, especially without asking why she wanted to know.  Frankly, I believe that this show would be just as good, maybe even better, without Juliette.The mystery surrounding the Royal Families, why they want the key, and what the supposed missing treasure is has me completely hooked!  I can't wait for more of the mythology to be revealed.  I would definitely recommend this show but be warned that some of the death scenes can be graphic.",Positive
"The thing I love most about this show (covering all seasons in fact) is its unique combination of extreme simplicity, gentle playfulness, and profound depth. IfMiffyandMonkeyhad a child, that child would be Adventure Time!There's also an amazing range in the &#34;feel&#34; of the individual episodes. Just in season two alone, that spans the gamut from &#34;The Chamber of Frozen Blades&#34;, a kind of affectionately absurdist homage to the ninja movie craze of the early 80's, to the far deeper but still almost equally playful &#34;Death in Bloom&#34;. In this latter episode our heroes must undertake a classic journey into the underworld. The only difference is, in their case it's to retrieve the soul of a houseplant!In this season we also get to see both the land of Ooo and the psyches of some of its leading characters explored in significantly greater depth. I'm particularly thinking here of the season opener &#34;It Came From The Nightosphere&#34;, as well as &#34;Susan Strong&#34;, and the climactic two-part season finale, &#34;Mortal Folly&#34; and &#34;Mortal Recoil&#34;. The mind of the Ice King in particular may well be unique in all of television: for he is at once a complete sociopath and completely human, with all of humanity's need for love and friendship.Watching an episode of Adventure Time unfold is like poetry. Still more so when you get to see whole seasons, because it's then that you get to appreciate the full range the creators are capable of. I've heard New Zealand novelist Janet Frame quoted as saying that &#34;a good novel should exercise all the muscles of the heart and mind&#34;.That's what you get in a full season of Adventure Time.Theo.",Positive
Not much more to say but you have to check out tis show if you like this type of genera better than House in my opinion,Positive
"Wow, what a great cast! The first episode has me intrigued.  I laughed at most of the bits.  The character development has potential.  I put this series on my watch list.  Way to go, Amazon!  You may have a hit original series.",Positive
"The After was the best and most interesting pilot I have seen in such a long time. As with some of the other reviews, I was left with so many questions: what was happening; what did all the 7 March birthdays mean; why were these people spared; how and why did the maid get captured; was it an alien invasion; where did the group run - all in different directions - only to end up together; how did the zombie like creature in the woods re-antimate and then turn into the spider/crab thing? I want to know it all! So, Amazon it would appear to me that you have a potential grand slam hit on your hands. Please continue on and make this into a long series! I'd sure watch it!",Positive
"This is not the Rome of your childhood education or the Rome of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. This is the story of a comparative Rome from both ends of the social spectrum; Julius Caesar as he rises to dictator and defeats Pompeii miserably, graphically and definitely vindictively. Mark Antony rises to power as well, the spoiled underling of Caesar whose desire for power in every form is graphic throughout the first season. In contrast, the life of a simple soldier, Lucius Verena and his sidekick Titus Pullo live complicated lives in Rome as they try to return to civilian life after the Gallic Wars. Quite a bit of nudity in this series, violence and total depravity which, of course, all conspired to destroy Rome. Extremely in-your-face series but I found it intriguing and compelling.",Positive
I really like the time period for which this show takes place and a look at what is was like for the general public back then (if you can believe them). It's an interesting time during the end of the civil war. The character development and mix is good for a first season show. I'm looking forward to watching season 2.,Positive
Always a twist in the plot with well scripted acting. Each episode is building upon the previous one not knowing what is going to happen next to a someone next. It is sad to see some of the interesting actors depart.,Positive
This is a great Show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Neil Caffrey is awesome and one of the best counterfeiters ever. Great show you will not be disappointed!!,Positive
"good plot, but it maintains an apathetic drudgery and monotony,  I feel like not watching it any more and have to leave it for a while.",Negative
I am very happy that the writers have not just caved in and wrapped up everything in a nice little box each week.  The acting is getting better as you see them switch emotions in the middle of a scene to complete the overall arc.,Positive
"Although Guy can be a little annoying at times,love going on the road trip.Lots of ideas for home cooking to.",Positive
"This could be as good as Smallville was. I think it's hitting its stride. It's got the action, the vibe and seems to have a developing story line.",Positive
"This started out on a good note with the premise of a small town engulfed in a transparent dome, but it soon fades into oblivion with its cliche' riddled writing and so...so acting. Is King so hard up for money that he signs off on anything they throw at him when it comes to making his books into a TV series? Can anyone remember the last King TV series that was good? Many are comparing this to Lost, but I can't comment on that since after watching a few episodes of Lost and its ""dog chasing its tail"" stories I had enough. Each weeks story on UTD kept getting more and more ridiculous with Big Jim and Barbie's over the top antics and the dumb as dirt blind leading the blind sheriff and town folk. People really get paid to write this kind of drivel and still others get paid to produce it? This is garbage TV at its worst. I know that I'm in the minority here, but come on people do you really think that this is that good?Rating 0 to 5 stars.Story = 4 For the premise and 2 for the actual stories.Direction = 2 The director is not getting good performances out of the cast.Acting = 1 to 3 The acting ranges from bad to average.Intrest Level = 1 to 2 The bad acting combined with the lack of creative writing makes me yawn.Violence = 3+ There are some good fight scenes and gun play.Sex = Yes, but its network TV, so nothing very hot here.Foul Language = Yes, but its network TV, so you will hear much worse walking in the mall.Entertainment Value = 1 This series only took three episodes before it started to tank.",Negative
Love the direction this show takes you in. Combines history with biblical predictions. Fun to figure out where it will take you next. Great acting and I love the humor thrown in. To have our common everyday technology questioned is really funny. I hope to enjoy the twists and turns for many seasons.,Positive
I viewed this show on a suggestion from a friend 5 yrs ago and was pleasantly surprised at how great it is . I am hooked.,Positive
"I don't watch soap operas, so maybe I wasn't prepared for UnderThe Dome? I do try to stay positive when I review. And I am pleased this is free for prime to watch.I am amazed at how many unrealistic situations and characters I'd like to see gone there are. Ep 4 was the worst so far. Not how an epidemic would play out, one dose of antibiotics wouldn't cure anyone. It could be a good prophylaxis, but in reality bacterial meningitis would mean a week of antibiotics for those infected. Not one dose and boom, you are cured.OK, maybe I'm being too unforgiving. I do like the enforcer, he seems ready to throw in and help despite his unappealing work. The kid he saved is sort of cool, too. The two moms are good. As is the sheriff. But the teenagers are entitled, none of the adults are acting like they are in a situation that requires disaster planning and rationing. Or doing more than forming repeated mobs.The journalist sucks, the councilman, the reverend, the deputy that went nuts, the teen on her way to reform school is horrible, the invading teenagers are totally unappealing, and no one is sharing information with anyone else. Huge fail.I'd love to see a real story based on what it would really be like, the concept is fantastic after all. Suddenly the Dome appears, episode one makes it all interesting. But, slowly it disintegrates from there. I've never felt more like I want to eliminate the majority of a cast and start over.It would be interesting to be shown what lengths people would need to go to in order to cope and survive. Pooling resources. Acts of true heroism. Working together. How to cope with privations, organizing, training, etc. But nope, none of that. I find I don't care what the conspiracy is. I dislike more characters than I care about.I can see that romance is taking the place of inspired writing in this series. It is always a fall back to pairing people up that keeps viewers interested for a little while.There are some good performances, and for that reason I'm giving the show 3 stars instead of 1 or two. And the premise is very good.Adding on a bit. Episode five is a bit better than the previous. Inching towards a rating of 3.25 stars. Still some really soap opera-y moments that make me want to roll my eyes, but aside from the first episode, which was fairly intriguing, this last one was the most watchable. But it is still nuts that anyone is hooking up at this point. Not interesting, I would rather have drama. And besides, its time to ration the condoms etc, guys and gals. You have a limited area and resources. Do not start over populating! Get your head out of your pants and start planning.I like the radio personalities. Barbie is more tarnished in this episode, geez. No heroes left?",Negative
If I hadn't of lived that era things would be confusing. That's some really deep seeded involvement. I find myself (almost) talking to the character telling them to &#34;wake up.&#34; This show pulls you in. Worth a watch.,Positive
Just as good as the first Season.  Really liked the characters and the plot was engaging. Worth watching more than once.,Positive
"This curate was quite good looking but his story did not make it for me. Also the loss of the actor who played the owner of the golf club was a real loss for the series. I did watch until the end, but I was not as impressed as the first two.",Negative
"Marshal Givens is flawed but I say that in a good way,  because its backed up with some personally grounded ethics that seem to prevail but seeps through the grate of absolutely lawful .........but, horse sensibly sound. Which is why I keep watching. It exposes a nasty underbelly of our societal spectrum, from silly to cruel it mirrors what stinks about America. Makes you cringe to think if the south had won we'd be more than a wink from the progress that ebbs sometimes comfortably close to the Idea of an Ideal America.",Positive

"Think top chef with guns.A ton of people, broken into teams, teams do challenges using weaponry from all ages (guns, rifles, bows, cannons, I think at one point even grenades.).Not a big fan of real violence, against real people, still and all fascinated by the technologies involved.The &#34;reality show&#34; elements... well, I tolerate them, not a big fan of that, even in this venue.The show is to the point, there is a lot of people interactions as the losing team has to put two people up to &#34;fight&#34; against each other in a challenge and the loser gets chucked off the show.Not a perfect show, but unique and to me anyway, it's fun to watch.",Positive
"Alphas is an original, fascinating show. It delivers strong characters, great stories, and suspense.Hopefully, SYFY will see fit to renew this outstanding show for a third season. Season two was a cliffhanger.",Positive
"I have been waiting for new episodes ever since the last episode of Volume 9 aired. For some reason I cannot get enough of this show. I just can't.Anyway, if you like the previous volumes/seasons/shows then you will continue to like this volume/season. Unfortunately, it is still only 1 show a week, but it is still an hour. personally I would like to see more shows and more shows per week.Still great and still worth the wait.",Positive
"We really liked most things about this show.  The characters are believable and the plot advances rapidly.  With some shows the back story can take 4-5 seasons to develop, where with Revolution the back story for season 1 resolved itself in one season.  Yeah.I am looking forward to season 2 with great anticipation.",Positive
"Olivia is bright, cheerful, witty and smart! She has entertained my grandchildren in every episode presented. I especially like the one where she has lost her favorite tights as they are supposed to give her good luck. In the end everything comes together and she finds her tights. She deals with the issues and resolves them. Good clean, wholesome entertainment!",Positive
"This is a really good drama!  Not for the light hearted or the very young, 16 is the youngest i would let watch this show, the sex is a little graphic at times!  All in all this is a great series!  Looking forward to next season!",Positive
"It was filmed in the dark , which for me I find almost impossible to watch because you can't see anything . That would eliminate the cost of props or settings perhaps ? Just a thought because thats all I can think about during episode 2 , I'm in the dark . Why are we in the dark ? I set the brightness on my Mac to the brightest setting . This combined with the poorly scripted ,so boring episode makes not even want to finish episode 2 .",Negative
"In Monsters, we take up the story 6 years after a NASA spacecraft has crash-landed in northern Mexico.  ""Something"" on the craft has infected the local vegetation, and it morphs, somehow, into an organic ""terrestrial octopus,"" about 3 stories high.These things really come out at night (do they hide in the water during the day?) and attack people for some reason (do they eat them?  the ""monsters"" certainly need more food than this).It seems like most of the ""damage"" attributed to these creatures is collateral damage caused by airstrikes and chemical attacks (you get a sense of this is the first 2 minutes).The story follows a news photographer (Scoot McNairy) who is given the assignment of getting the daughter (Whitney Able) of his employer out of Mexico (the quarantine zone is expanding).  You never find out what the daughter is doing there, but, surprise!  They miss the last ferry, and have to hoof it out (why the publisher father doesn't send a jet down is undetermined).The movie really is about the social and sexual tension between these two.  The ""monsters"" are really a minor part of the story, although they are the background for the plot.  Now, this doesn't bother me too much, because I'm not a horror film fan.  I was more interested in the sci-fi dimensions.McNairy is a very believable photographer.  Able comes across as naive and needy.  The trip to the US border is eventful, with the viewer constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.  But will it?The gigantic barrier at the US border seems more appropriate for Jurassic Park than for this movie, except it has no gate where the road cuts through.  Weird.Fundamentally, this human story, and the alien angle, weren't the best match.  I don't regret the time I spent watching it, but I think there was more potential here.",Negative
"Very entertaining. Everyone on the cast is top notch. I'm sure Alpha House is not getting to many rave reviews from those on the right, so I'm pretty certain they already have a show about Democrats in the works.",Positive
"Such a guilty pleasure but a fantastic show! They've got good writers, a great cast and I keep coming back for more. I swear it's not as cheesy as the name makes it out to be. If you're into supernatural stories you should absolutely check out this show.",Positive
"When something as good as this series has been, you begin to dread the end even as you get excited to see it come to a conclusion. Wonderful story with a depth of characters and story line rarely seen.  We will make this an annual treat along with some of the other great series.",Positive
"Three Norwegian college students made this documentary as a film studies project. We know them only by their first names, Kalle, Johanna and Thomas. Although this film was given the unfortunate name, Troll Hunter, it is primarily a disturbing educational experience. Some of what a viewer sees might seem unnecessarily bloody and frightening, but this is what these students found after they attached themselves to a reclusive, surly bear hunter. I will only say that this man, Hans, and his superior, Mr. Finn Haugen, worked for the Norwegian Wildlife Board. As we and the students later learn the men actually were employees of the secret government agency, the Norwegian Troll Security Service (TSS). This agency, it turned out, was created to kill trolls and hide their existence. Outlandish? You must watch this documentary film. This film was released only after the students disappeared and their work was discovered by the side of a road.The film is presented as it was discovered, from snips and pieces made by the students. Kalle was the cameraman, Johanna was responsible for the audio, Thomas was the on-camera commentator. We do not know their last names, only that they were students from Dottmar College. They were three young people dedicated to their project, sometimes frightened but with a deep desire to learn and to record the truth. They have never been seen again, and we do not know their fate. Many suspect the TSS might be involved since it since has been learned that the TSS has been attempting to cover-up the existence of trolls for many years. This was discovered only inadvertently when the Norwegian prime minister, Mr. Jens Stoltenberg, inadvertently confirmed the existence of trolls during a press conference.In the course of these students' film we encounter the Tosserlad, the Jotnar and a group of young Ringlefinches, all huge beasts with gigantic noses, long arms and covered with filthy hair. We see how gigantic are these beasts, towering over forests and wreaking destruction as they move. We learn that their inability to convert vitamin D into calcium makes them vulnerable to turning into stone in sunlight as their bodies over-react to UV rays. Unfortunately, (because of the likelihood of sensationalism), the students also record terrifying chases through dense dark woods, bloody encounters and frightening suspense. There is the sacrifice of a goat to snare, I believe, a ringlefinch. The young goat bleats its fear.Some of what the students filmed simply is not appropriate for children. Indeed, even the preparations for approaching these creatures might seem too disgusting for family viewing. The application of trollstench, particularly to the armpits and groins, is vulgar. This substance is so foul to the nostrils that gagging usually is induced. Trollstench is prepared by cooking down the difficult-to-collect bodily wastes of trolls. This, however, is essential if one is to disguise one's own scent, particularly if one is a Christian. Trolls are enraged by Christians. Yet as fearsome as these huge beasts are, they are susceptible to disease. This might be, the students learn, the cause of troll rage.Kalle, Johanna and Thomas framed their story around Hans, the trolljegeren (or troll hunter). Hans might not be as reliable as the students think. Yet Hans undoubtedly knows his trollsCall Troll Hunter what you will - a documentary, cinema verite, or simply a student college film project. It remains a remarkable record. Any who have managed to watch that other classic documentary, Forgotten Silver, will not regret watching this.",Positive
"Spectacularly executed third season.  Excellent story-lines driven by engaging actors.  This ensemble cast went to work and got it right.  If you want a drama that has humor, wit and charm, try putting on Suits.  It's a great fit.",Positive

"I love this story, and am angry that my cable in this area doesn't have the CW network. They have no idea what quality TV really is!",Positive
The movie is okay but it can use some work. It has more 'lows' than 'highs' and the lack-lustful sex scences don't do much to pick it up. It has no excitement but there's room for it. Get some sexual or some type of movtivation conflict drafted into it some how to cause some type of tension that will bring or almost bring the house down. The movie has enough of variable scences to make it possible. Good luck.,Negative
"First, I love Veronica Mars. Cleverly written, generally well acted, good production values. Not to mention that Kristen Bell is a little doll! I would rank the first two seasons among my top 10-15 all time favorite shows. It started out strong in season 3 as well, but then began fading. By this time, several interesting characters were gone- Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter)and Aaron Echolls (Harry Hamlin)most important among them. Another problem with the third season is that there were too many threads left hanging and unexplained subplots, perhaps to have been picked up in the 4th season, which never materialized. I suspect that late in the 3rd season, cast, crew, and writers knew they were not to be picked up for another season, and everything started going downhill. If you haven't seen this series, you may be able to find some episodes online to see if you like it. I was poking around free TV sites (legal sites, paid for by advertising, of course)when I first found this series. But then if you do like it, I would say the first two seasons are probably a buy, but could only marginally recommend the 3rd season.",Negative
Each season gets better and better. I think it helps to see the episodes as a marathon to get the feel for all the characters. Timothy Olyphant is so georgous with those teddy bear brown eyes.,Positive
"I haven't watched the show in awhile.  I just watch the end of the year reviews.  What incredibly stupid people!  Nothing ever gets resolved.  No one changes for the better.  The most ignorant of them all, in my opinion, is Caroline Manzo.  She needs to  learn how to shut up.  I also think that, as imperfect as she may be, Teresa is the most interesting and, in spite of the ""napalm"" error, she is probably the most intelligent of the bunch.  I don't understand why they are all ganging up on Teresa, but perhaps it is all a set up, in which case, we are fools for watching this garbage.",Negative
"Playback (Michael A. Nickels, 2012)Playback has the dubious distinction of being the lowest-grossing domestically-released American film of 2012 (it made a grand total of $252, playing on one screen for a single week). It's not the worst film I've ever seen--in fact, it's only the third-worst film I've seen today (and you never know, it might get worse after this!)--but that doesn't mean I would suggest you get within ten feet of a streaming copy of it.We open in 1994, with a young chap named Harlan Diehl (Dogman's Luke Bonczyk) killing his entire family save his sister's baby before being shot by police. Fast-forward fifteen years, and a group of high-school students, working on a project for their journalism class, are investigating the Diehl murders, headed by  Julian Miller (Purgatory House's Johnny Pacar) and his girlfriend Riley (The Master's Ambyr Childers). Julian enlists his stoner buddy Quinn (Black Swan's Toby Hemingway) to ""acquire"" some information that only the local police have access to; Quinn has an in to the police department in the form of Detective Frank Lyons (Christian Slater), an ephebophilic detective who keeps Quinn rolling in dough--or illegally-swiped evidence on the Harlan Diehl case, it would seem--in exchange for hidden-camera nudie-cutie flicks of the local hot high school chicks. The problem is, when Quinn gets his hands on the tapes, he finds that Harlan Diehl's legacy extends beyond the grave...If you haven't figured out within ten minutes of this movie starting what happened to the baby from the opening sequence, you haven't seen enough horror movies. That sort of predictability, unfortunately, plagues this entire production. Once you know all the principal high school students, you should be able to pause the film, sit down, and sketch out a list of who's going to die when. And you know what? You'd probably be close enough to right to be extremely disappointed in this movie. And you have every right to be; Nickles, a character actor (probably best remembered for portraying Jim Morrison in Wayne's World 2) who abandoned the screen to go behind the camera, does absolutely nothing to meddle with the formula. This is depressing, because given some of the angles this movie adopts (it would probably contain a host of minor spoilers to go into any detail, but I will say that my favorite character in the film, Wylie, portrayed by Galaxy Quest's Darryl ""Chill"" Mitchell, is a video-store clerk and would-be film historian whom Julian finds himself consulting more and more as they get closer to uncovering the mystery of Harlan Diehl's motivations), Nickels had ample opportunity to bend some corners, kick some sandcastles, what have you. And he took none of them.It's not necessarily a bad movie, but it is an extremely frustrating one, boring, predictable, and full of potential that will forever go unrealized. If you do end up watching it, well, you have my condolences. *",Negative
We have just started watching this. Love it and recommend it to learn about your country. Very interesting and informative.,Positive
"The Shield - wherein it is proven that nothing elevates a TV drama to a place above daytime soaps more than graphic violence, profanity and gore combined with corrupt cops, grotesque pimps, ho's galore, violent mobsters of all ethnic varieties, rapes and pillage. Throw in a generous bunch of victims and perps, both repulsive and sympathetic, and you get an excellent drama that will satisfy all your voyeuristic needs. Good writing plus good acting plus good production values create a memorable series. If you can imagine Elmore Leonard and James Ellroy collaborating on The Wire and dropping it into the ethnic cauldron of Los Angeles, you'd get The Shield.",Positive
"&#34;Anna&#34; or &#34;Mindscape&#34; is a story about John Washington (Mark Strong), a memory detective. John, like some others, have the ability to access people's memories with the use of a device and some ESP powers. Recently John has had some problems as his own memories about his dead wife have been interfering with his work.John has been given the job of Anna (Taissa Farmiga) the daughter of a very wealthy family. She is 16 and is on a hunger strike. She is extremely intelligent i.e. &#34;off the charts&#34; and gifted. Her step-father (Richard Dillane) believes she is &#34;haunting.&#34; With a step-dad and a teen daughter, our minds always go there, but in this film we are dealing with a far more complex issue.John enters Anna's memories, which makes things more complex as her memories don't seem to fit the facts...or do they? The film is a mystery as we, like John, attempt to figure out if Anna is the victim or perpetrator.It is a good mystery. Anna draws us in with her intellect. The color red plays a role as the color of blood, roses, dark room, and John's beach house.May be too slow for some people. 3 1/2 starsParental Guide: 1-2 F-bombs. Brief photo nudity.

"Really enjoyed this first series. I had to read the book in school when I was 12 years old and HATED it , thus I was reluctant to watch this but the Stella cast pulled me in. It goes without saying that dame Judy is a gem, she can do no wrong for me, have watched her for most of my life when she was a young actress in England. I look forward to the next episodes.",Positive
Ran across this little gem completely by accident.  Watched the first episode and was hooked-so much so I purchased the entire season based on seeing one episode.  I am very happy it has been granted a second season.  Can't wait for this to come out on dvd as well.,Positive
"I've watched all 3 seasons, this is one of the best series I've seen lately. It's to bad that it ended in 2007. I'm curious as to why it ended, somehow the networks always end a good series and replace it with something that flops in a few weeks.Enjoyed it and highly recommend it.",Positive
"Jon Stewart should be required watching by every American who refuses to think on their own. It would help this country immensely if every minute spent on Faux News would be required to match time spent on Jon Stewart's The Daily Show.

They connect past statements by the same people, follow the same statement given by numerous faux news people and look into controversial subjects with actual facts.

"This is it.  Kirsten Dunst is great in a very naive part (as she usually is in any part).  Ryan Gosling is his usual overly suave self.  It's a rather dull script, that goes exactly where it says it will.  And &#34;everybody knows this is nowhere&#34;.",Negative
"I have heard from a lot of people about this show, so I was curious to see a few episodes for myself.  It lives up to the descriptions of my friend, but I was disturbed by how the therapists treated - or rather failed to treat - the underly issues of the &#34;hoarders.&#34;  The show is seriously over dramatized, which isn't unexpected for a reality TV show, but I would expect more from the therapists, who I would assume have a professional duty to treat their patients rather than to just antagonize for the cameras.",Negative

Every show is great with things to learn and laughter to be had. Don't miss this show well worth your time.,Positive
Still enjoying this show.  Was really bummed out after I finished Season 2 that the next Season was not available for free!,Positive
"It's a good series with nice plot and interesting, likable characters. I just watched through 17 episodes today and I find them interesting. The art only in few places isn't perfect, like when the nose seems to be wrong and legs of these cybernetic humans are so very long and the bodies are so much shorter than of real humans, but maybe that was done on purpose. I heard that Disney was or maybe still is about to cancel this cartoon. That would be a great shame. These episodes are great and they kept me entertained. You might enjoy them as well. I am really looking forward for the last 2 episodes to finish this season and I am truly looking forward for season 2! It's a cartoon, not to be missed!",Positive

"John Cleese is possibly the funniest man on the planet. His writing is funny, his way of speaking is funny, his movements are funny. There is an awful angularity to him, he bends at all the wrong places, his knees are up too high. To watch him try to open a bottle of wine is to watch an exercise in uncoordination that is funnier than the entire output of every stand up comic since the Greek guy with the rocks in his mouth. And the situations and dialogue he created, because it was Cleese who wrote the scripts for Fawlty Towers, are even better.Basil Fawlty is wonderful to watch. He is craven and bullying at the same time, a pompous suck up, utterly incompetent, a blowhard who blames his shortcomings and failures on the world. Cleese has the character down pat...that supercillious little git of a hotel manager or railway station clerk, the middle manager who is in over his head, with steam coming out of his ears, convinced that the world is out to get him.  In real life, they're horrible. When they are running Fawlty Towers, they are a thing of wonder to behold.Basil's wife is beautifully underplayed by the incomparable Prunella Scales. Sybil Fawlty is a woman inured to Basil's tantrums, shenanegans and schemes. She tells him what to do, then spends the rest of her time on the phone, saying ""I knoooooow"" and ""Reeeeeee-alllllly"" to her friend at the other end of the line. She gets more humor out of those phone responses than most TV sitcom characters can get out of an entire script. Basil cannot, will not, do what this sensible little person says.  When Basil looks at Sybil with his gimlet eye and mumbles ""Coiffed Shrub,"" if you don't fall out of your chair and drop to the floor, convulsed with laughter, you must be Swiss.No offense.Connie Booth, who is American, was married to Cleese and co-wrote the show with him. Booth has a smaller role as the hotel chambermaid...and the voice of reason who plucks Basil from the edge of the abyss only to find he knows another route.Even if you are from the Bunderstadt, you will have to laugh at Manuel, the Barcelonian waiter (played by Andrew Sachs). Manuel's blank and totally mindless stare, his utter lack of comprehension as Basil--hair sticking out above his temples, sweat on his upper lip, eyes blazing with rage and madness, body bent in some impossible configuration that has his torso and hips and knees zigzagging away from one another at impossible angles--tries to get him to perform the simplest task, must surely cripple you with laughter.No offense.If you are among the six people on the Earth who have not seen Fawlty Towers, drop what you are doing and watch.  The show ran so briefly, there are very few episodes, but they never get old and never get stale.  Even so, in a perfect world, George Bush would not have invaded Afghanistan. He would have sent our troops to London to get hold of Cleese and force him to write one more season.  At least he would have found one good use for his waterboarding.No offense.",Positive
There has never been a funnier sitcom in the history of television!  Basil cannot help but to dig himself deeper and deeper.  He says what he means and means what he says.  Too funny!  I wish he had made more episodes!,Positive

"Well, I rented this movie after seeing the behind the scenes for it and it looked good, but the actual watching of the movie was slow, did not show the action that looked so cool during the movie behind the scenes.  It was ok but not the best.",Negative

"Not sure if this show would work as well October - May.  However, I start thinking about football in July. The upcoming selection video my FFL does every year, running hundreds of mock drafts, the trip to LV for the actual draft and loading up my offshore account for the first weekend of NFL.The point to my rambling tangent is that this show is first and foremost about the relationship that Dani has with a football player (""T.K"" King) and a football team.  Someone once said ""life is all about timing"".What this show does well is to go behind scenes into the life of unbalanced players and their collective sense of entitlement.The show is not overly thought provoking, nor is it an adrenaline rush.  What this show is-is light hearted summer fare, which happens to be broadcast during the network ""dead zone"".",Positive

This was a great movie to just sit back and watch with popcorn!!  It was engaging and Richard Gere is always a good actor in any role.,Positive
"I don't think so. Kind of a wreckless show that portrays programmers as a bunch of aspie, half-wits whose success is all a gamble based on some dude backing the project. Nope. Not realistic at all. Truly successful projects mentioned in the show didn't need a huge amount of capital to get off the ground. I think its a sloppy concept.",Negative
"The &#34;bad guy&#34; in this show is as much the people running the research station in Antarctica as the virus and genetic code that the virus is carrying. It has good characters and the developing story line keeps you interested. It's kind of grisly and gross at times, though, but if you can put up with that, you'll probably enjoy the show.",Positive
"Predictable, production values average, acting the same.  Perhaps it is the tennis theme that has the other reviewers so enthused.  I, however, would not recommend this to others: the trajectory of the story line is so stereotypical of many teen movies out there with a lot better talent.",Negative
"This finale was awesome, it was tense, dramatic, action packed, it felt complete. I was amazed at how well they did this season and how they closed it out, very satisfied and greatfull for Burn Notice having been a awesome series for 7 years.",Positive
Good reality t.v. ghost stories. the thought of hauntings is always a fun watch. I wouldn't reccomend it for family viewing though.,Positive
"Louie has risen steadily in the last few years.  He is one of the greats.  Pryor, Carlin, Williams, Rock, Seinfeld, Hicks, etc.  Comedians though are very personal.  You are either going to love him or hate him.  His show is kind of what Seinfeld was supposed to be...just about his everyday life.  Seinfeld the series was great, but it originally was supposed to be what Louie is.  Seinfeld became situation comedy based on what TV demanded at the time.  I am glad our society is to the point to enjoy the everyday life of Louie and the way he weaves jokes into real life it amazing.  The great comedians are best when they are trying.  Louie is one of the greats. Hope you enjoy.",Positive

"Season 6 was the saddest season for me as Don kept falling, falling, falling with his bad choices, seemingly linked to his past and general humanness.  Although life is challenging him even more, with his mistakes coming back to haunt him in season 7, it's good to see he begins to start finding himself again and fight back.  I won't say more or I'd need a Spoiler Alert.  And of course only half of the season is over.In any case, like others have said in various venues, I've started rewatching the entire series again.  To my surprise there were some important things I didn't catch the first time around--and some things that seem to have been changed or edited??  Each episode of this show is better than most movies out there.",Positive

Scolfield (Wentworth Miller) and Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and the others find themselves working with an FBI agent (Michael Rapaport). He claims he'll clear their names if they steal something from the Company that's very important to them. While Sarah is really alive and joins Michael's team.That's only the beginning of the season. There's many twists and turns as the season goes on. This last season certainly doesn't disappoint and it's probably the best next to season 1. The season was packed with action and drama. The series finale was one of the more satisfying ones to any show. The only thing that bugged me a little was the very end but I can't really say it didn't work. It's just not how I preferred to see it end.,Positive
"These episodes no longer have &#34;Robert Ecland&#34; as a character, but his replacement still performs in the same manner and is maintaining the enjoyable quality of the series.",Positive
"The Bates Motel is a great example of how TV is able to tell a much richer story than a two-hour movie can expand upon and it imagines a plausible but intriguing backstory into how Norman Bates developed into the famed psychopath of the film. Skilfully avoiding the ""murder of the week"" format that shows like Dexter inevitably become, it introduces several extra characters beyond Norma and Norman - another son, an interestingly corrupt sheriff,and a whole town that's a character in itself bringing an undercurrent of omnipresent crime with a surface of small-town charm.The show gets many details right. The iconic motel and accompanying house are recreated painstakingly to anchor the action and create the uncomfortably eerie environment. The production design blends 1940s and 1950s elements with present day which avoids the jarring change in the timeline and Norma's wardrobe and choice in house decor all resonate with a bygone era but sit remarkably comfortable in an almost idyllic coastal setting. And unlike any other current show but reminiscent of the best parts of Twin Peaks, it balances a feeling of everything almost being perfect but at the same time being completely off kilter and about to fall into the abyss.The script is first-class and builds an awkward, uncomfortable but understandable relationship between the mother and son. Whereas his killer alter-ago could have been cheesy and uninvolving, it's slowly built over the course of the show and engagingly acted by subtle-but-creepy British newcomer Freddie Highmore. As for the mother, Vera Farmiga should be showered with awards for her performance as the show-stealing Norma Bates whose nuanced character is superbly realized and keeps the credibility alive.Beyond the main duo, it's also the location that's captivating for audience. There's a weirdness and criminality to the place that's believable for an out-of-the-way coastal small town that harbors secrets and provides a backdrop that interacts with the Bates family. I'm watching series two now, which is just as good as the first run, and without revealing too much the show expands on how the town features in their lives and develops numerous subplots around this.If you enjoy creepy and suspenseful drama, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the Bates Motel. Let me confess, I wasn't expecting much when I started watching given the pointless Psycho movie remake and the shaky history of movies recast as episodic drama so I was more than shocked to find I not only like the series but think it's probably one of the top three currently airing.",Positive
Entertaining at every turn! Can't stop watching all the episodes. Every season just keeps getting better. Highly recommend Justified to anyone.,Positive
"I love this television series!!! It is beautiful, fun and exciting! My entire family enjoys it and cannot wait to see what will happen next!",Positive
"This flick is simply pathetic.  It tries to channel the raunch of ""The Hangover"" movies with the female angst of ""Bridesmaids"" and fails at every turn.  I have nothing against the girls engaging in the kind of horseplay usually reserved for the boys but here it just comes off as juvenile.  It would help if there were some characters you can root for.  This flick attains the unthinkable by making Kirsten Dunst unlikable.  And her character works with pediatric cancer patients!  The usually reliable Isla Fisher comes off not as a smart person playing a dumb character but just plain stupid.  I guess if you were to point to any positives there's kind of a sweet turn by Rebel Wilson as the pleasantly plump bride-to-be.  If you're looking for a girls night out type flick skip this one entirely.  My wife who is less discriminating than me couldn't stand ""Bachelorette"" either.",Negative
"i for one am glad to see kiefer sutherland in a role which doesn't involve horrific world events with massive explosions and destruction.  this time out he is in a much more hopeful series where he plays a father of a gifted child who has been mistakenly diagnosed as autistic.  he instead has a special ability to communicate through complex math patterns.  in this episode, kiefer, the widowed father, a social worker, and a studier of this gift (danny glover) begin working out the true nature of the boy's living experience.the boy actor is quite good.  he narrates the series but does not speak dialogue.  kiefer sutherland, in a recent interview, said that the boy actor was the first boy whom they tested with him in a scene.  thereafter, they tested him with all these other boys until he protested, saying, ""hey, just bring back the first kid.  he was perfect.""  i agree.  a mistake on casting with the boy would have been an utter disaster for this show.there is a summary review on this item's product page that is excellent, written by another Amazon reviewer. it gives all the plot details and actors' names.  i suggest you read it next if you want further detail.  give this show a try.  only the pilot aired in january so that has to hold you until march, when it begins as series tv.",Positive

There's always a lot of plot twist which makes it very interesting and the characters are believable. Hope they continue to make these.,Positive

"After watching four seasons of ""The Office"", what I was consistently amazed at was the show's ability to stray away from the formula in order to cultivate new territory. For example, during a large portion of the third season Jim and Pam (the emotional backbone of the show) are separated and lose that incredible chemistry. However, that separation ends up bringing in the Andy Bernard character, who has been a wonderful addition to the show.This fifth season did much of the same. It started off great, especially when Michael Scott finds a new employee, Holly, who catch match him step for step in the craziness department. Each episode contains at least one absolutely hilarious moment (and some come once every few seconds!), even despite the fact that the ""same old"" cast is back again. However, as the seasons approaches roughly the 2/3rds mark, there are some major changes that take place, primarily for Michael and Pam Beasley. This creates a run of 5-6 episodes that, to be honest, just aren't as hilariously funny as the rest of them (as Jim Halpert's character cannot hold the show in lieu of Michael).However, as they so often do, the writers take that disturbing change and eventually make it work out for the better, as the emotional sides of many of ""The Office"" workers are touched on more than ever before, what with all the changes occurring. When the show finally gets back to its original pattern/format, it feels like slipping into that old familiar spot on the couch again...you might take it for granted while you have it, but removing it from your life will just want it back that much more!Thus, I once again give this season of ""The Office"" my highest approval for its ability to be incredibly funny and still develop characters in a meaningful way.",Positive
"I got an episode in February, but then no more. are there any more episodes going to start soon? Really enjoy this show",Positive
"I have no idea, but they did it! David Tennant is BRILLIANT! He may not be the best-looking actor in the world (so say many of my teen and twenties friends), but his talent and the character of the Doctor make him the sexiest! I think he's gorgeous! His interaction with Billie Piper is breathtaking and even though I despise chick-flicks and romance type stories, I think the love story between the Doctor and Rose is the most emotion-grabbing I have ever experienced. I hate to admit it, but I cried... more than once! and so did my hubby, and all our college aged friends!",Positive
"I like this series.  The scenes with Nikola Tesla were very poorly researched, and I hope that is not an example of the accuracy of everything else.Tesla did not invent AC power, he invented three-phase current which is well suited to running electric motors.  He did not invent the high voltage ""Tesla Coil"" until about ten years after the period when Westinghouse and Edison were debating AC versus DC power.  So the scene with him giving a high voltage demonstration to show AC is safe is completely incorrect.",Positive
The host and her helper are both very appealing people and they tackle real life projects.  The first design uses extremely expensive features.  Then they recreate the room within a realistic budget.  It's fun to watch and get ideas.  Some of the do it yourself projects work and others don't.  But all of the ideas are interesting and doable.,Positive
"wow! I really wasn't expecting a whole lot, and at first it seemed like just another post-disaster show, but the last 20 minutes or so blew my mind.  I want to see more!",Positive
"Season four is quite possibly my favorite season, although season one comes in pretty close behind. Gus seems to find his own place this season, and Shawn has a nice thing going on at the beginning and end of the season (as usual). The first episode, ""Extradition: British Columbia"" is hilareous: Shawn takes Gus on the road to Canada, where he passes himself off as Santa Barbara's head detective and Lassiter & Juliet have to play second fiddle. Then we find out the whole reason he went to Canada: it was originally a trip he had planned for Abigail. I had to watch the episode again, because suddenly a lot of the scenes took on whole new meanings.I also enjoyed ""A Very Juliet"" episode - very touching, even if it does pull Juliet and Shawn apart a bit. Perhaps that's why in Season five he sends a picture of a dog to all of Juliet's boyfriends with a message ""this is you"". Ah, the on again-off again relationship between the two.If you enjoy the series, this is another one to add.",Positive
"This was just painful to watch.  I am reminded of the repetitious stereotypical-based skits that make up the majority of the bile-generating torture that is Saturday Night Live; however, SNL has the occasional performance that makes all of the suffering worth while.  This show has no saving grace.",Negative
This is a great informative show about the history of comic book cartoons.  It was a true eye-opener and great history lesson! It's a must-see.,Positive
"For those who like it, great. But there is absolutely nothing new or interesting. If you appreciate the innovative well written shows that we can watch on Netflix, HBO, etc., you won't last long on this one. If you love this show good for you, this is my opinion, you don't have to agree with me.",Negative
This show has characters with good relationships with each other and are interesting. The different items with special powers is a interesting twist. It's hard to watch just one!,Positive
"OMG, this is almost un-watchable. I don't understand. Big name folks involved. $$ spent on effects and sets. You've begun with an interesting premise. But the story is garbage. Recycled garbage at that. Pushed along by hopelessly cliched dialogue. How sad. Who is the target market? Why is the leader doing an ""Aw shucks ma'am""/Marshall Dillon impression? There is no chemistry between the husband and wife. The sullen misunderstood teenager plot line has been done to death. Let it rest in peace! I guess I answered my own question. The target market are kids who are too young to recognize the cliches. To them it's new stuff. Okay... Well, I'm going to watch a Firefly episode to cleanse my pallet.",Negative

"4.5895 starsI'm surprised by the tepid reception this got, but their loss! I howled with laughter many many times during this incredibly droll film, especially at the Kline scenes. The guy has never been funnier, except maybe in Wanda. This kind of humor is probably waaay too dry for many, but if you like Wes Anderson or Jared Hess or any other off-beat, smart new writer/director, there's something for you here.I'd go so far as to compare this to Withnail And I and Death At A Funeral (the original) for its sustained yet muffled hilarity, and those are two of the funniest modern movies I know. Not all of The Extra Man is great, but most of it is, if your mind is open and your funny bone doesn't mind being tickled from various obtuse angles. I laughed more during this film than most any movie I've seen in a year or two, but then I like it dry, and this is that, to be sure.Ames' characters are both endearing and frustrating, and ring true in all their satiric excesses. I liked everyone in this, and even Reilly's campy voicework somehow fits in, particularly in the beach scene. The cross-dressing might be a little weird for some, but then weird can lead to some very unique laughs, and the scene with the Spankologist has a gorgeous moment: watch her face after their first kiss. It glows in joy and memories of much younger days and it's actually very touching, made even better by being subtle and brief.There's a lot of heart in this film, and I'm surprised more folks didn't feel it. I sure did, and think it's a minor masterpiece in its own way, especially if you know enough older people to enjoy the sly wit Ames and Pulcini/Berman share with us. I also thought the direction was pleasantly quiet and unshowy, but set up the best lines very nicely time and again. Plus, some of the scenes have something very warm and genuine about them, a real rarity in any film.Maybe I'm nuts, but I loved almost everything about The Extra Man, and think that time will treat it very kindly. It's one of a kind, and Kevin Kline shows why he's one of the great comic actors still working, classic on the level of Peter Sellers.If you don't mind a little pathos with your comedy, and like your laughs both broad and edgy, you might just find this to be a gem.",Positive

"Like the dancing, the kids, the moms ... the dance teacher seriously needs therapy to address her multiple issues!  Also would have liked more backstory information - i.e. the mom who couldn't make the stage performances because she had to work - what type of work does she do that's so urgent she can't get out of it?  and why are there no other family members that can sit in her place?",Negative
"If you enjoy watching children being abused by an emotionally stunted ego-maniacal bitch ... then this is your show.I'm ashamed to admit I watched Dance Moms for years.  I loved seeing the children dance, so I'd fast forward the seemingly staged Mama-drama and clips of Abby shouting herself into chronic laryngitis.  Last year it slowly dawned on me that these people aren't faking.Many of the adults on this show are emotional train wrecks.  Abby really is a pretentiously self serving fowl mouthed (yeah I know she says she doesn't use bad words) bitch, who doesn't give a $***about anyone's feelings but her own.  She's also a child abuser in the WORST way.  What kind of wacked out idiot would label a child ""road kill"" on national TV?!  Why would ANYONE constantly reduce children to tears on national TV?!  That these kid's parents pay Abby to constantly hurt their children makes them just as bad.As an adult survivor of child abuse, I know how much damage words can cause.  That this show is allowed to continue, and these children remain fodder for abuse by Abby, wanna be dance teachers, supposedly well meaning Dance Moms, wanna be Dance Moms with wanna be children dancers ... turns my stomach.Mark my words, these kids are growing up with issues ... HUGE issues.  The fact that Child Protective Services hasn't been called in to investigate Ms Abby's disgusting behavior is disgraceful!The ultimate irony is the fact that Ms Abby was in bankruptcy when this horrid show started.  Shame on the producers, shame on Abby, shame on the parents and shame on us for allowing this horrid show to thrive.",Negative

If she could just shut up and stop falling all over her lines, I'd like the character a little more, but she is extremely annoying!  However, the brilliance of Betty White and Wendy Mallick certainly make up for Valerie's droning.  Georgia Engle makes a wonderful addition to the show, and the constant barrage of guest starts such as David Spade, Regis Philbin, Carol Burnett, Jean Smart, and Alan Dale will keep you entertained.",Positive
"In the wasteland that is television and most ""entertainment media"" there are fewer and fewer really shining stars.  We are left with two masterpieces of darkly comedic drama.  Dexter is one and deserves its own review.Breaking Bad is the apex of adrenaline-pumping cliff-hangers, with every real-life adventure possible built in.  It outshines and pales anything else on TV, with the exception of Dexter.Breaking Bad is built on a plausability-factor that works in the real world, if at its most extreme.It laces the most perfect syncronicity into every plot and each and every plot realates to each and every previous as well, no doubt, as all plots to come.I end every episode recovering my breath and uttering ""My God, that was good!""If they were to produce 26, or even 52 episodes per season, it wouldn't be enough.  Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and their wonderful cast tear my heart out, make me furious, and leave me feeling compassion for the most flawed group of characters imaginable with every episode...Though fewer, as the series intensifies, there are also incredible laughs to be found.Breaking Bad is life lived on levels none of us can imagine for ourselves, but know, could happen to any of us with one wrong turn or one cruel twist of fate.Bravo to a true masterpiece of entertainment!  I am in awe of a perfect work in the making.If you have not watched Breaking Bad from the beginning, it is the only place to start.  Buy season one, and just keep going!  You will have no regrets, and you will experience the very best any media has to offer in truly imaginative entertainment.",Positive
"I just flew through Arrow Season 1 and fell in love. It usually takes a show quite some time to get up to speed. This show not only worked from the start, it has one of the better ensemble casts on television. In particular the fact that you're essentially watching two shows at the same time as you're watching what happened to Oliver Queen while he was lost on an island and now that he's back. It is evident that the team behind the show fleshed out a multi-year story arc and that's exactly what a show needs to succeed. Usually when a show gets a chance and becomes a hit they then have to figure out how to keep going in the second season.Beyond that, this show has the same vibe as the Christopher Nolan Batman series (serious, done as if it's in the real world, etc.). But unlike the Dark Knight trilogy which Nolan created completely separate from the DC universe, this show swims in the DC world. There are so many references it's hard to keep track as nearly episode has a villain or reference to a hero. They've introduced Barry Allen and now a Flash pilot is being filmed. If you love DC characters and want to see a show that is smart, sexy, kicks ass and treats the source material with respect - get into Arrow.",Positive
"If you like fantasy and witches in particular, you will love tale as I do.  I didn't have high expectations for this series given the usual fare on this channel.  I was amazed.

"If you were a fan of the Veronica Mars series, you will love the movie. I love the way it was funded by fans too! I think the movie is even better than the series. It picks up Veronica's life several years after the series ended. The mystery is complicated and hard to solve. The decisions Veronica has to make are difficult life changing decisions. The acting was solid, the characters complex, and it looks like a much more expensive movie than it is. I hope they do a sequel.",Positive

"This was anxiety-provoking to watch:  I wanted so much for this actress to find her voice.  Instead, we have another version of ""Grey's Anatomy"", this time in Denver.  What's important and what is valuable in this story line seems to be the perceived awkwardness of the protagonist rather than the knowledge and care of her patients.  Force of personality to make this a viable premise just isn't there:  instead, a lot of talk about high school, social hierarchies (""10 Things I Hate About You"" anyone?), ""flop sweat"" and being ""uncool.""  Please.  If the appeal is to the 12 to 18 demographic, then maybe but to an adult audience?  Not smart nor edgy enough.  It is just the Pilot, however, so it might be worth another look see if for only to see where this actress might take ""Emily Owens, MD.""I have continued to watch this series and while a bit spotty in places, that is, tentative dialogue, shaky plot lines, I have found that elusive voice that is all Emily's own:  mature and in the place she finds herself with less frequent references to high school faux pas.  Relationships between colleagues continue to be established on a realistic level with tension between the ""should be"" couples as opposed to those that are. In this episode, ""Emily....the Good and the Bad"" there is a strange sort of melt down and less severity coming from the Chief Resident character.  On the other hand, Emily finally gets it:  she doesn't need to be so hard on herself especially when she tries so hard to be honest and good.Onto Episode 8 and we are back, so disappointingly, to high school rivalries, childish competitiveness in the lab while waiting for life-determining test results.  Really?  Some good lessons in between but not redeeming enough to rid this series of an overriding theme that detracts from every other subplot.  It's ""Mean Girls"" meets something like Grey's Anatomy but not nearly as mature dramatically.",Negative
"I only watched part way though the first episode and had to turn it off.  Showing a celebrity throw up is not my idea of entertainment,",Negative
"This film was a minor letdown after reading all the five star reviews.  There's nothing intrinsically wrong with the film.  My theory is that after years of being out of circulation it's reputation exceeds it's actual artistic worth.  Everything here is aces, though.  Good direction, atmosphere and writing.  The acting is superb with the stolid Robert Mitchum leading the cast.  I particularly liked Steven Keats' gundealer and Richard Jordan's duplicitous fed.  I think we've been spoiled by the high quality of films in this genre with Sidney Lumet's ""Prince of the City"" and Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"".  Recommended without reservation but not as enthusiastically as some.",Positive
"Once more DVD comes to the rescue of a TV series that has turned from so so ratings to solid hit. The series is BONES and there is no better way to watch this than on DVD. Why? Because once you get into the series you'll want to continue on rather than wait for the next episode.Just released is BONES SEASON THREE: TOTALLY DECOMPOSED EDITION. How can it be that this show has been on that long already? For those unfamiliar with the show its time to catch up.Based on the real life of forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs, the story revolves around Dr. Temperance Brennan (Emily Deschanel), a forensic specialist who works at the Jeffersonian in Washington, D.C. When the FBI comes calling for assistance in the form of Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz), Temperance takes to field work like a pro with an intense interest in each case presented.Along with Temperance, known as Bones to Booth, are a team of equally dedicated professionals at the Institute. Among them are Angela (Michaela Conlin) who specializes in facial and body reconstruction via sketches and computer software, Dr. Jack Hodgins (TJ Thynes) who specializes in organic materials and Dr. Zack Addy (Eric Milligan) who knows more about bones than, well, Bones. Each member of the team adds to a complete whole not only in their expertise but in their character functions as well.For the first two seasons we were allowed to explore the world of the ""squints"", Booth's nickname for the intelligent research team at the Institute. But as the show continued, we watched as Booth came to appreciate each individual in their own way. We also watched the sexual tension between Booth and Bones grow in the most subtle of ways as they worked case after case together.There you have it, the main crux of the series. But it's more than that. It involves cases being solved using clues found only by this team of forensic anthropologists. Each week they discover clues no mere mortal would find with the naked eye. And each week Booth and Bones have the chance to put the guilty behind bars. At the same time we get to watch the interplay between the characters as well.What you have here is a combination of age old detective show combined with the technological side shown in the various CSI series. But rather than focus mainly on the science of evidence we get that as well as interaction between characters in more familiar TV territory. Romance and buddy systems are seen in each episode as opposed to straight police work.This brings us to season three. This time around we begin with Bones acting unlike herself. Could it be because Booth sent her father to prison at the end of last season? Could it be the attraction between Bones and Booth became too much? Or could it be because Zack had decided to take a leave and head out to work in Iraq?  Just as the stories offer clues to the murders, the series offers clues and at times answers to these questions.As the season starts we find Hodgins and Angela still very much in love, still planning on marrying and still searching for the man who was a one night stand Angela married in a drunken stupor. This was an arc left open from season two that finds an answer this year.Zack returns from Iraq a bit different. Fortunately for fans of the series (and Zack) he shows up in the first episode, just in time to save the day and help find the criminal.Bones and Booth start off not nearly as close as before. Whichever of the reasons discussed that seem to have had an effect on Bones is clearly visible from the first minutes of episode one. And as the pair start to work things out, they begin therapy to help with their work.The first show offers a new challenge for viewers and the team as they encounter a secret cannibalistic society that has left their calling card. While the Gormogon killer may not be a familiar name to most, it will be by the end of this season. Not only are the guilty not found by shows end but they continue to show up during the season.A more in depth view of Bones sex life is offered as well (no, not seen) as we begin to meet the men she dates. This seems to upset Booth who does his best to hide it. The affection between these two characters may be more blatant than Scully and Mulder of X FILES but it is still held in check for the present.Humor, mystery, relationships and friendship are all regular topics in each episode of the series. And Season Three brings forth more of the human characteristics of each member of the forensic family found here. It is these human qualities and interaction between characters that makes this show the success that it is. While Bones comes off as cold and out of touch with the world around her, Seely comes off as having lived more than his years would seem. Put these two together and you come up with one of the most successful teams since Nick and Nora Charles.Extended episodes, alternate episodes and more make this box set worth adding to your collection. And if you don't have them already, buy the first two as well.This is a fresh series with great acting that makes the entire production believable. And that is what makes for good TV. And good TV now means good DVDs. Take a 3 day weekend or the holidays to get acquainted with the Bones family. It's a great mystery filled time for all.",Positive

I haven't read the book yet but I pan to soon.It is funny in places, sad in others, but worth 90 minutes if your life to watch.",Positive
Great show. The second season was digging deeper into Charlie's enemies and it was just so compelling.  Side stories were getting good.  All the actors are top notch and on their game.  I wish NBC would have renewed it or another network would have picked it up.,Positive

"I have been a Survivor fan since Season 1 and had high hopes for this season.  After three episodes I abandoned it.  None of the cast was that interesting and most were uttering disinteresting--or flat annoying.  The challenges were stale rehashes of past seasons, and the setting was yet another generic tropical beach.  Is Mark Burnett trying to get this show voted off of the network island?",Negative
"It's beautifully animated.  But it sorely lacks in the story department.  The show plays more like a -- surprise! -- game show (which is what Blues Clues and Super Why! both essentially are).Plus, there's a big fundamental problem with the concept:Because the protagonist (Bianca) can grant any wish she likes, there's no real conflict anywhere in the show or in any possible story.  If something goes terribly wrong anywhere in an episode, we're aware that Bianca can ultimately wish the problems away.For instance, when the little boy says he wishes he wasn't afraid and Bianca turns to camera and says, ""He wishes he wasn't afraid.  What should we do?""  Well, the obvious answer is for Bianca to grant his wish to not be afraid.  Instead, she inexplicably refrains from doing so.  Why?  Because if she did grant his wish to not be afraid, then that would be the end of the story.The way to play this beat in a more interesting and dramatic fashion is to have Bianca attempt to grant the boy's wish, only to have the wish backfire so that now he's even more afraid to go onstage -- in fact, because of Bianca's wishing error, he's now petrified.  As a result, Bianca has to decide if she should risk wishing yet again for the boy not to be afraid.  What if the wishing goes doubly wrong?  That's when she decides to help the boy by taking direct action, in a real-world way that kids at home can relate to, instead of by attempting another wish.To make the show truly dramatic, her wishing should have as many negative consequences as positive, so that you then have recurring conflict in the plot and an actual story to tell and a theme to explore -- instead of these little disconnected and relatively conflict-free vignettes.As it now stands, the few times Bianca screws up her wishing, it's merely for comedic effect.  Never for conflict or drama.  A huge story-telling engine totally squandered!  ""Be careful what you wish for!""Looks beautiful though!",Negative
"Summary:  A group of 100 kids comprised solely of criminals are sent to the earth to see if it is survivable.The premise is really interesting.  It is really cool that a bunch of kids are sent down to see if the earth is survivable.  It stays cool as long as you don't think about it too hard.Darn, I started thinking.  While this is a cool setup for a start of a new series, the problems with this premise abound.Let us start out with the very initial part of the premise, the space stations.  There was a deliberate vagueness about how the people came to be in the space stations.  If it was done on purpose, they would have laid in an adequate supply of back up parts.  They would have also provided ships with sufficient fuel to ferry the survivors back to the planet.  All of these supplies would have taken up a lot of room, which would limit the number of people allowed on the ship.  There was every indication that people would have been sent purposefully to the arks, since food, medicine, and other essential supplies would have run out long ago.  Another interesting aspect was reproduction and old age.  Reproduction was vaguely touched upon.  It was obvious that each family was limited to one child.  It was also obvious that due to a limitation of supplies that a sick child or a child born with a genetic anomaly would not be allowed to live.  What wasn't so obvious was that these parents could not be allowed to further reproduce.  In a closed system, any genetic mutations could have serious repercussions for the system as a whole.  It was also obvious that adults would have an expiration date.  Old age is a suck on resources just like illness.  The reality is that they could have spent a little more time on the ship, and this would have been a much cooler story.There were also problems that were not touched upon.  Let us start with gravity. Artificial gravity fields take a lot of power to create, and since they do want to return to earth, they would have to make fields that were comparable to earth.  Also, it would be essentially for bone development and growth in their children.  Radiation would also be a problem.  What protects the earth from ionizing and nonionizing radiation that is present in space?  Can you say ozone layer.  While there would be some protection rendered because the ark is still in the upper atmosphere.  The ozone layer would be unlikely to afford much protection-because the space stations would be outside of it.  No protection from the ozone means that this people are daily exposed to radiation from the sun and space.  They would have been more protected on the earth in a hole in the ground.  While these arks are a cool idea, they have a lot of limitations.  You can see why they would want to be vague about living in an ark in space.We find out that this mission is essential to assess the feasibility of returning to earth.  If the earth isn't survivable, the leadership on the ark will have to make decisions about who will be culled/killed so that the ark will still be able to support life.  Hmmm.... their decision is to send a bunch of kids who are largely comprised of untrained criminals.  They send no supplies with them and no means of communication.  That is such an excellent idea (sarcasm font).  They are provided no Geiger counters or meters to measure ionizing radiation.  Just because you aren't immediately losing your hair doesn't mean the radiation levels are safe.  They have no food and no weapons, and they have no immediate means of acquiring them.  They are directed to an old bunker, but after 97 years, there is no way to ascertain if the supplies are still viable, accessible, or even present.  Let's be honest, only in fiction would you send a team that is untrained and doesn't have the best interests of their community as a motivator to succeed on a mission.  This scenario lacks plausibility.  The show is designed to appeal to young viewers.  It is not designed to be plausible.  It is also designed to have many opportunities for young angst.The question you have to ask yourself is did the show have to be so stupid just to appeal to young viewers.  Ultimately, the answer would be no.  They knew that they had an insufficient number of pods for the population.  This would immediately remove the right of anyone over reproductive age of going, so this would make the cut-off probably around 35.  That would really be tough, but here comes the tougher part, the really young would also not be able to go.  If you are in a hostile land, small, crying children would be very dangerous.  This would make it unlikely that anyone 5 or under would be going.  It would also be likely that their parents would not be going as well due to their unwillingness to leave their small children.  And there is your 1200 people.They could have still had young people in the initial party, but they wanted to set up a scenario where there was a lot of mayhem.Here is the problem, mayhem and angst will only take a show so far, especially a show like this.  After a while, it starts to fizzle because you will only be left with the same mayhem and angst, and warring with the natives gets old fast.So they landed with no food, weapons, or helpful technology into a hostile world that appears to be rife with mutations.  Umm... if there were this many mutations in just a hundred years, it is likely that there is still a LOT of radiation.  Also, if mammals like deer are mutated, you would also be seeing mutations in humans.  You would also be seeing a LOT of new viruses and bacteria to which the little ark kids would have no immunity.  Oops, just another thing that was not addressed.Maybe the writers will be able to come up with a lot of new exciting scenarios to keep their audience transfixed, but honestly, I was starting to get very bored of the show.  By the time it had ended this season, it held no more excitement than the pilgrims coming to America and trying to survive.  And truly, the reason outlined for the fighting just felt forced.  Your ship killed some of our people.  I also am getting really tired of their romantic angst.",Negative

"I feel the key thing to remember when thinking about THE ORPHANAGE is that this is a ghost story, not a horror movie.  The idea, the intention, is the creep out the viewer, to give the viewer pleasant chills.  It's the kind of movie that doesn't merely FEAR the afterlife, it accepts that ghosts can have their own motives that are just as worthy as the motives of living folks.THE ORPHANAGE comes from the current revival in the ghost story within Spanish cinema.  Fortunately, we haven't had to endure too many English language remakes (like we did with many of the misguided Americanizations of Japanese films recently).  We get to see the original films, in their original languages, with subtitles.  Although THE OTHERS was remade into English, a terrific film like THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is only viewable in Spanish right now.  That film is simply too steeped in Spanish history to be in any other language.THE ORPHANAGE takes place in a deserted old mansion that some 30 years prior had served as an orphanage.  The main character is returning with her adopted son and her physician husband to reopen the facility into a home for special needs children.  The mood of the movie is one of foreboding right from the start...how could this rundown, dusty old place every be an inviting home for anyone?  Sure enough, right away the young son Simon begins to ""see things"" and he quickly finds new ""imaginary"" friends that make him do things.  There is NOTHING new about this whatsoever, and for awhile, you might suspect you're in a clich&eacute; ridden story.Then comes opening day, when the new children arrive for a sort of welcoming party with their parents...and Simon disappears.  The frantic search of his mother scares off the prospective clients, and for the next bit of the movie, we see the mother's descent into obsession.  She is convinced she can find her son.  Further, she is convinced that some ghosts have taken him.Naturally, her husband doesn't believe her and neither do the police.  At one point, we have a GHOST HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL kind of scene, when a psychic comes to the house with her scientific crew.  (The psychic is played by Geraldine Chaplin...an unusual but effective casting choice.)  This crew kicks things into a higher gear...but they depart and eventually, mom is left on her own to unravel all the secrets she needs.I don't want to reveal much about the plot specifics, because part of the fun of these kinds of movies is figuring out just what the ghosts want and who they are.  The  movie builds to a fairly surprising plot revelation and finally to a bittersweet ending.  It's a combination of SIXTH SENSE, DARK WATER and POLTERGEIST.It's an artfully made film...very atmospheric.  There isn't much unusual about the story, the mood or the technical work...the filmmakers aren't breaking new ground.  But what this films DOES bring is a genuine feeling of sadness and a true glimpse at the bonds of mother and son...and even a mother to all children in need.  It's a well-acted film, with Bel&eacute;n Rueda really terrific as the mother, Laura.  She's in virtually every scene, and it's her actions, reactions and emotions that drive the film.  We experience in through her eyes.  She's a fragile woman who finds pretty large reserves of toughness when she needs to, and it's nearly as satisfying watching her character grow as it is to see how the plot resolves.This movie doesn't cover new ground or show us anything we haven't seen before.  But it's skillfully made with no irony, and it simply works.  It's a pleasurable ghost story indeed.One note on the ""R"" rating:  There is one ""F"" word.  Otherwise, I think it gets an R because so much of the death and jeopardy involves children.  I think the film is fine for anyone 14 and over.",Positive

My daughter 2 and son younger both watched this and love doggies. They were already singing along with the opening theme. At the end my daughter keep asking for more. We hope to see more of teeny tiny dogs.,Positive
very funny and interesting.  My husband really enjoys watching the videos and keeps watching as long as there are more of them,Positive
"Wow! Really cool flick. I was pleasantly surprised. This was a very original movie, which is hard to come by nowadays. If you are looking for a movie that has a little bit of everything (Horror, Suspense, Love, Parties), then this movie is for you.",Positive
"The first thing I'll say is that I will watch season 2, if there is one. I am a history lover and writer of historical fiction, so Vikings was right up my alley. I felt the series was gritty enough to portray the time period, and the outcome of some of the character's choices were well depicted. The storyline kept me clicking from one episode to the next, but towards the end I was annoyed with the main character. He went from someone I could root for against his adversaries to a power hungry ass who had few likable traits.I'll watch season 2 because I do care what's going to happen, so this was good enough to keep me hooked.",Positive
